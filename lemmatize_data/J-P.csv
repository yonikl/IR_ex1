2024-04-03 05:32:31.543,jpost,"Once in a while , new startling and exciting discovery filter through even in this data-drenched Internet-accelerated world . The classical music community wa surprised and thrilled around a year and a half or so ago when a long-lost score by Felix Mendelssohn and Ignaz Moscheles , which came to light in 2009 after a hiatus of close to 200 year , wa restored to it former glory and unveiled to the public.Internationally renowned pianist Tomer Lev and his MultiPiano Ensemble are now proffering the work to local audience , with the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra ( IPO ) in tow.The four-date series kick off at the Charles Bronfman Auditorium in Tel Aviv tonight , April 3 ( 7 p.m . ) , followed by two further concert there on April 4 and 6 ( 8 p.m . and 9 p.m . respectively ) , closing at the Jerusalem Theatre on April 7 ( 8 p.m . ) . The Fantasy and Variations on a Theme by Weber ( aka Fantasia and Variations ) ha a fascinating subtext and will be featured in forthcoming concert . The program also includes an intriguing and now highly poignant work from 2012 by Israeli composer Arie Levanon , who died on October 31 at 91 , called Land of Four Languages.The full lineup includes Orawa by Polish composer Wojciech Kilar , who died in 2013 , Dvorak & rsquo ; s Carnival Overture , and Beethoven & rsquo ; s Violin Concerto in D major , with Vadim Gluzman a soloist.Fantasia and Variations had the perfect marketing springboard regarding the performing artist , debut set , and the hit parade of the time . The original ivory tickler were it composer Mendelssohn and Moscheles , with whom Mendelssohn studied for a while.Lev say the venture wa destined to get the ticket office rolling from the off . & ldquo ; The work is based on a theme by Weber , & rdquo ; Lev explains . The score in question wa riding high in the popularity stake of the day . & ldquo ; It is quite a story . In 1833 , Mendelssohn wa enjoying the best stage of his career . He wa a superstar in England . That wa the country where he wa most admired . & rdquo ; THAT PUBLIC profile led to an offer that wa too good to refuse . & ldquo ; His teacher , Ignaz Moscheles , lived in London . Both were of German Jewish origin and the most idolized piano virtuoso in England and Europe . They were the two great Jewish virtuoso . & rdquo ; That wa also recognized in lofty societal circle . & ldquo ; They were invited to be the key performer in a charity event under the aegis of the royal palace in London . It wa a high-brow charity event , & rdquo ; Lev notes.The organizer sought something that would do justice to the occasion and wow the audience . They chose a proven product and asked the artist to run with it . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; They went for the two biggest musical celebrity . Each performed part of a recital , but the event 's highlight wa when they were asked to jointly prepare something based on one of the hit number at that time : Gypsy March , written by Weber for a musical theater production called Preciosa . Everyone wa mad about Gypsy March . & rdquo ; Back in the early 19th century , classical composer and musician frequently allowed themselves to stray from the compositional straight and narrow . That suited Mendelssohn and Moscheles down to the ground . & ldquo ; They were asked to improvise variation on this theme , the Gypsy March , & rdquo ; say Lev . & ldquo ; They were both excellent improvisers and played like in a jam session ; you take a tune with a chord chart and improvise . & rdquo ; That come across in Fantasia and Variations . & ldquo ; You have one piano playing something elaborate while the other play more in line with the chart , and then they switch . It wa an open approach . & rdquo ; It worked well . & ldquo ; The event wa an amazing success , and they asked them to do it again , & rdquo ; Lev remark , noting that it wa not just a matter of reprising the crowd-pleaser . `` They had more time to plan it for the second event . They were both so busy . They decided to turn the improvisation into a written composition . They also added an orchestra . & rdquo ; Hence , the format for this week & rsquo ; s Tel Aviv and Jerusalem concerts.NOT THAT Mendelssohn and Moscheles were exactly scratching around for work at the time , but , presumably , the response to their effort must have had them rubbing their hand with anticipation of thrilling audience elsewhere . However , a with all good yarn , there wa a dramatic twist . & lsquo ; Shortly after the second concert , the sheet music disappeared , and it wa forgotten . & rdquo ; There wa more drama when Mendelssohn died 14 year after the charity event doubleheader , at only 38 . Undeterred , his partner in box office success decided to make some hay while the sun still filtered through before the memory of the triumph lingered . & ldquo ; Moscheles tried to restore the sheet music , & rdquo ; say Lev . That , it transpired , wa easier said than done . & ldquo ; In fact , he came up with a different composition . He didn & rsquo ; t really manage to restore the original work . & rdquo ; Nevertheless , a they say in certain commercial quarter , you can regain your public profile if you hang around long enough . & ldquo ; Suddenly , they discovered the original manuscript in archive in Saint Petersburg , of all place , & rdquo ; Lev chuckle . That proved to be a game changer.Plenty of elbow grease had to be invested before the work could become a practical proposition for public performance . & nbsp ; That is precisely what Lev and his MultiPiano counterpart & ndash ; Berenika Glixman , Nimrod Meity-Haftel , and Lior Lifshitz & ndash ; have done in the past year or so , in London and Berlin and , a couple of week ago , at Carnegie Hall in New York.Sheet music wa languishing in the archive , and it wa deplorable , just a the international classical community began gearing up for the bicentennial of Mendelssohn & rsquo ; s birth in 2009 . It wa a mess . & ldquo ; There were many thing scribbled on the page and many thing added , and the paper wa in a bad state , & rdquo ; Lev advises . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; They took expert from the state conservatory in Moscow , with expert in ink and paper . Eventually , they had a good copy of the original work 1833 . & rdquo ; All & rsquo ; s well , and that end well . When Lev got wind of the development , he invited the chief restorer of the sheet music to come to Israel to give a talk about the whole process . Much to the quartet leader & rsquo ; s surprise and pleasure , the lecturer gave him the score after the lecture.Lev wa determined to grace the work with commensurate respect and revive public interest . That led to the aforementioned concert worldwide , with the Berlin date filmed and recorded , the recording due out soon on the Hyperion label , and a rendition of an intriguing composition by Moscheles . & ldquo ; We are one of the only ensemble in the world to have a copy of the sheet music and to perform it , & rdquo ; Lev note proudly.Lev : thrilled to play the original work in IsraelLev say he is thrilled to be able to play the original work here . & ldquo ; The concert with the IPO close a lovely circle , after concert in London , Berlin , Carnegie Hall in New York , Tel Aviv and Jerusalem . You could see this is a sort of resurrection of the work , bringing it back to the surface . The audience have responded amazingly so far . We have had standing ovation everywhere . & rdquo ; There is , surely , more rapturous applause due for the ensemble and IPO when they present Fantasia and Variations here . And Levanon should rightly be well received , too . His composition feed off the sound , rhythm , and sensibility of four culture that the Romanian-born composer considered to be core to the State of Israel & mdash ; Hebrew , Yiddish , Arabic , and Ladino.Levanon wrote the piece for MultiPiano , which performs work on two piano for four , six , or eight hand , with or without an orchestra.Lev belief the time is particularly ripe for the work to resound from the concert hall and , hopefully , change mindset & ndash ; and possibly make some difference to the dismal state of regional affair . & ldquo ; When we started touring internationally with MultiPiano , we saw that people don & rsquo ; t know about Israel & rsquo ; s multiculturalism . So we decided we wanted to perform something that would reflect the pluralist face of this country . & rdquo ; Levanon wa up for that . & ldquo ; He composed Land of Four Languages . He chose four traditional tune in different language . His message wa that if the four can live together harmoniously , in the score , maybe they will learn to live together in the real world . & rdquo ; The composition ha been well received thus far , but in the wake of October 7 , Lev feel the cross-cultural creation ha taken on added significance . & ldquo ; After Levanon & rsquo ; s passing , and after everything Israel ha been through in the past few month , the value and message of this work are more relevant than ever . & rdquo ; For ticket and more information : http : / / www.ipo.co.il/en /",' loved but not lost ' : piano ensemble present new classical music restored
2021-07-14 22:06:13.437,jpost,"This week , a number of voice , many of them linked to Israel & rsquo ; s former ruling Likud Party , claimed that the Mughrabi bridge , which link the Temple Mount to an area near the Western Wall and is used by non-Muslims to visit the Temple Mount , is in danger of collapse . Former transportation minister MK Miri Regev said & ldquo ; it is forbidden to wait another moment with the demolition of the bridge and the construction of an appropriate replacement . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The concern about the bridge ostensibly date from a month ago when an engineer & rsquo ; s report said that the wood the bridge wa constructed with doe not enable safe use of the bridge . This raise question about why the previous government of Benjamin Netanyahu didn & rsquo ; t replace or reinforce the bridge recently , despite being in office for a decade . How did a bridge suddenly become unsafe around the same time Israel got a new government ? Why is there now a new potential crisis at the sensitive holy site ? Did the crisis emerge precisely when the Kingdom of Jordan and Israel are working to repair tie ? Jordan is sensitive to any change to the status quo and previous attempt to alter the bridge have met with protest and also conspiracy spreading about al-Aqsa being in danger . These kind of conspiracy have led to conflict in the past , including the recent Gaza war . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; So how did we get here ? In 2011 , a temporary structure , often called the Mughrabi bridge after an early ramp and neighborhood that once existed underneath the temporary bridge , wa closed due to safety concern . At the time , report said that & ldquo ; official closed the Mugrabi Bridge on Sunday , three day before the municipality deadline to close the ramp leading from the Western Wall plaza to the Temple Mount . The Jerusalem city engineer , Shlomo Eshkol , ha warned over the past year in a series of letter to the prime minister and the Western Wall Heritage Foundation & ndash ; which oversees the area & ndash ; that the temporary bridge is unsafe . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Let & rsquo ; s recall what happened at the time , 10 year ago . & ldquo ; The municipality originally set November 28 , 2011 a the deadline to destroy the bridge , but . . . Netanyahu intervened to stop the demolition , worried about triggering riot across the Arab world . In the most recent letter , sent last week , the municipality insisted the entrance must be closed to the public until a new bridge is built . & rdquo ; Netanyahu chose to cancel the demolition of the bridge because of concern in Egypt and Jordan . The Jerusalem Municipality tried to close the structure on December 12 . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Oddly the issue then disappeared from the headline . Somehow , the unsafe bridge continued to exist with some modification . In 2014 , a new report emerged . A new part of the bridge had been added . & ldquo ; Erected less than two week ago , the bridge had not officially been opened when . . . Netanyahu ordered it be dismantled after it became clear that the project wa not approved by the relevant authority , and amid mounting Jordanian protest . & rdquo ; Once again , the temporary bridge , erected after the ramp collapsed partially in 2004 , had become permanent and any change were seen a a & ldquo ; status quo & rdquo ; issue threatening peace in the region . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; It appears that in 2011 and 2014 the Netanyahu government chose to forego change in order to maintain calm . Now , suddenly , there are call to remove the bridge by member of the same party that didn & rsquo ; t remove it for a decade . This , despite the fact that it is well known that previous change have always resulted in a crisis . Is this controversy about the bridge or creating stumbling block for the new government in tie with Jordan ? Jordan & rsquo ; s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi ha met his Israeli counterpart in what the Jordan Times call a & ldquo ; semblance of normality . & rdquo ; There is a new deal to supply Jordan with water . Prime Minister Naftali Bennett ha been outspoken on the importance of tie with Jordan . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; For Netanyahu , the Kingdom of Jordan wa always a sour point . He ran into many controversy with the kingdom dating back to his time in office in the 1990s . Netanyahu didn & rsquo ; t make progress on the plan to develop the Arava peace valley with Jordan , and Jordan harshly slammed Israel during the 25-year anniversary of the peace agreement between the country , demanding Israel return land that were part of the agreement . In 2017 , an incident with an Israeli security guard in Jordan , in which two Jordanians were killed , led to another crisis . Most recently , Netanyahu canceled a short trip to the UAE on the eve of election after a stop in Jordan apparently wa nixed . In addition Jordan & rsquo ; s crown prince canceled a trip to Jerusalem in March . Relations were at their lowest point in memory . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Netanyahu ha slammed Jordan in recent day , critiquing the water deal and accusing Jordan of having tie to Iran . The insinuation wa that Jordan had transported oil from Iraq to Egypt and that somehow , this help Iran . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; It is in this context that there are rising call for the government to make change to the Mughrabi bridge . Any chance are likely to cause a crisis . Closing the bridge would anger some of the Jews who visit the Temple Mount weekly . It would also mean non-Muslims could not visit the historic area near the mosque and Dome of the Rock . Any change to the bridge would lead to complaint from Jordan unless there wa coordination . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; There is no doubt the bridge need to be safe , both for those who use it and because it stretch over a part of the woman & rsquo ; s section of the Western Wall . There are many question to be asked why this bridge issue wa never responsibly addressed for more than a decade . It appears convenient that suddenly those who were in office for many year and made no change now want it closed , demolished , changed or removed . Like many thing that took place over the last decade in Israel where problem were managed , or what some call & ldquo ; mowing the grass , & rdquo ; wa done to postpone addressing major issue . The bridge is a symbol of how Jerusalem and Israel were managed . This crisis management meant postponing many major problem , such a dealing with Gaza & rsquo ; s constant crisis , to the issue facing Bedouin in the Negev , to ignoring the crowding at Meron that led to a disaster , and then not investigating it . The current government want to address the issue , but stoking up issue like the Mughrabi bridge appears to be a way to create a crisis with Jordan precisely when Jordan and Israel are keen on working together again . Whether the kingdom might be interested in being flexible regarding the bridge might be address , but such status quo issue usually take time and are sensitive because of the position of the Palestinians and the Wakf and other authority and stakeholder . The King of Jordan is meeting the US president on July 19 . Perhaps responsible policy regarding the bridge will prevail . & nbsp ; & nbsp ;",is jerusalem ’ s mughrabi bridge in news to spark jordan crisis ? - analysis

2021-10-08 16:06:29.253,jpost,"All the window in the Hamamdeh family & rsquo ; s small stone home are broken . The shattered jagged glass is one of the many visible scar of the violent event that took place in Khirbet al-Mufaqarah on September 28 , when the small , dusty South Hebron Hills Palestinian herding village of some 122 people wa transformed into a battleground that left 12 Palestinians and five settler injured . & ldquo ; All the home are like this , & rdquo ; said Mahmoud Hamamdeh , adding that & ldquo ; this wa a battle for our home . . . . We were attacked with stone and stick . & rdquo ; His three-year-old grandson Muhammad Baker Mahmoud Hamamdeh suffered a head wound in the attack serious enough to require a three-day hospital stay at Soroka-University Medical Center in Beersheba . A week later , dressed in gray pajama and sandal , the brown-haired boy sat on the concrete floor in his home playing with large , multicolored Lego that two Israeli visitor had brought him . The room wa mostly bare . A number of small , thin , colored foam mattress were laid on the floor for seating . Muhammad had fitted the red , green , yellow and blue piece together , a his mother , Bara & rsquo ; a , and his grandfather Mahmoud described how their home wa pelted by stone thrown by Jewish extremist who they presumed were settler . & ldquo ; This is the room where the child hid , & rdquo ; Mahmoud explained , because it steel shutter could provide safety . His grandson Muhammad , however , never made it into the safe room , because he had already been hit by rock that went through two different window of the bedroom he had been napping in . The room wa filled with glass and blood , recalled Mahmoud , explaining that they thought he had died . Mahmoud walked over to the bedroom , where he held up the bloodstained sweatshirt Muhammad had slept in , to underscore how frightening the moment had been . The attack , which occurred about 2 p.m . on the Simhat Torah holiday , is the worst such incident of violence in that West Bank village that anyone can remember . The community is not linked up to an electricity or water grid and is located off a dirt road between the two settler outpost of Avigail and Maon Farm . The three community are all unauthorized , and a a result the status of all three community is tenuous . Both Palestinians and Israelis hold that their right to the land supersede the IDF regulation that govern Area C of the West Bank where they are situated . Area C is under IDF military and civilian rule . Palestinians hold that this land should be part of the permanent border of a Palestinian state , while the Israeli Right belief that this land , which is part of the biblical heartland , should be included within Israel & rsquo ; s sovereign border . PALESTINIAN FLAGS flutter in al-Mufaqarah , and Israeli flag can be seen in Avigail and Maon Farm . The historical narrative of these community differ , a do their language . Similarly , there is a wide gap between their narrative of how and why the attack on the village unfolded . A South Hebron Hills Regional Council spokesman claimed a group of some 20 settler had walked in the morning from Avigail to Maon Farm and were on their way back when they were attacked by Palestinians . There wa only a small army presence in the area , and they took action to defend themselves , he said . The security officer from Maon Farm came to their assistance , and he wa attacked , with rock thrown at his vehicle , the spokesman said . He provided The Jerusalem Post with photo that depict Palestinians holding rock , including one that showed a masked Palestinian with a slingshot . Another photo showed Palestinians beside a building with stone and a stick . Channel 12 posted a video from the event , which showed army soldier during the event accusing a Palestinian & ndash ; Basel Adra , from the area , who volunteer with the left-wing group B & rsquo ; Tselem & ndash ; of setting brush aflame . Channel 12 then added that this wa done so that Palestinians could accuse Jews of setting their village on fire . Adra took to Twitter to debunk the Channel 12 charge , posting a video that showed that the fire in question wa started by a tear-gas canister . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s a lie . The fire wa caused by an army gas bomb . I literally filmed it , so I have proof . Also , there aren & rsquo ; t any home there & ndash ; just a pile of wood , & rdquo ; Adra tweeted . He added that & ldquo ; I saw the fire , filmed it , and called resident to fetch water . & rdquo ; Initially , he wrote that two soldier helped him , but then another soldier filmed him & ldquo ; to fabricate a false accusation against me . & rdquo ; According to B & rsquo ; Tselem the incident started around 2 p.m . when settler attacked a shepherd in nearby Khirbet a-Rakeez while he wa grazing his flock . B & rsquo ; Tselem alleged that the settler killed four of the shepherd & rsquo ; s goat . Adra said the shepherd called for help , and then a stoning incident broke out between the settler and the Palestinians , with the army arriving shorty after and shooting tear gas and stun grenade at the Palestinians . He charged that , at it height , the event included a many a 80 settler , and that the violence spread beyond al-Mufaqarah and also included attack on some home in his village of al-Tuwani . Violence at this level , he speculated , could occur only if it had been preplanned in an attempt to scare Palestinians into leaving the area . & ldquo ; They don & rsquo ; t want u to live here , & rdquo ; he added . The attacker , he said , vandalized home , vehicle and cut water line . B & rsquo ; Tselem published a video that showed a stoning attack by Jewish extremist against a home in al-Mufaqarah . In the video one can hear the sound of breaking glass and the explosion of stun grenade and tear gas . One settler source blamed the attack on outside Jewish extremist , primarily teen , adding that it wa clear the violence there wa unacceptable and went above and beyond any claim with respect to self-defense . He said that the army and the police have to be the one who take step to prevent the violence . The army declined to be interviewed for the article and the police did not respond a of press time to a request for detail about their investigation into the incident . Police initially arrested six Israelis and one Palestinian in connection with the September 28 event . In an unusual move OC Central Command Maj . - Gen . Yehuda Fox visited al-Mufaqarah last week and spoke with Mahmoud Hamamdeh to learn firsthand about the incident . Palestinians , including Mahmoud , said that from their perspective the incident could not have occurred without the army , which they said wa on the scene almost from the start . The village of al-Mufaqarah is close to the scene of a September 17 incident in which an IDF major and his unit prevented a group of left-wing activist from reaching a small Palestinian hamlet near the Avigail outpost so a to deliver a truckload of water . The soldier were captured on film using what appeared to be undue force to dispel the activist , who had been marching on both side of a narrow paved road that lead to the outpost and that also pass by Khirbet al-Mufaqarah . Less than two week later , it wa this same IDF unit that wa unable to prevent a group of extreme right-wing teenager from reaching al-Mufaqarah and pelting it home and resident with stone . THE AL-MUFAQARAH incident come amid a heightened focus on violence by Jewish extremist and settler against Palestinians in the West Bank , in a period when tension have increased overall in that region , including in the South Hebron Hills . According to the UN , a of October 4 , there have been 264 attack this year by settler and Jewish extremist against Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem that resulted in property damage and 101 in which there were injury . This is compared to data from all of 2020 in which there were 270 settler and Jewish extremist attack that resulted in property damage and 82 in which there were injury . Separately , UN data showed , 69 Israeli civilian have been injured by Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem , compared with 16 last year . According to South Hebron Hills Regional Council head Yochai Damri , & ldquo ; There are 1,500 incident of rock-throwing on Jews on the road in the Judea-Samaria area every year . & rdquo ; STILL , A wide-ranging group attack such a the one that occurred last week is rare . Mahmoud Hamamdeh said it is impossible to describe the chaos of the attack ; the violence wa overwhelming , and on all side one didn & rsquo ; t know what to do and where to be , he said . Rubber bullet , stun grenade and tear-gas casing are littered in the village . He rolled up his sleeve to show how he had two wound on his arm , which he said were from the stun grenade and tear gas canister that were thrown . When the attack began , he and his sibling had gathered for a family lunch , when they heard shouting about approaching settler . & ldquo ; I had 22 grandchild who were present , & rdquo ; he said , and the whole time the attack lasted , their safety wa uppermost in his mind , to say nothing of the wounded Muhammad . Damri said he & ldquo ; immediately denounced , and always vigorously denounces , any harming of innocent person , regardless of religion or origin . & rdquo ; This go , he said , for needless act of violence on either side . Representatives from Avigail and Havat Maon went to visit the boy , Damri said , adding that & ldquo ; I , too , a the local elected leader of our Jewish community , asked the child & rsquo ; s family if I could visit . The family politely refused & ndash ; concerned that the Palestinian Authority would retaliate against them . & rdquo ; Avigail resident Reut Malichi said she had gone to see the three-year-old Muhammad this week , having already visited him at Soroka last week a well . A school counselor and a mother of seven who grew up in the Gush Etzion region , she is among those from Avigail who have a relationship with Palestinians from al-Mufaqarah , particularly with Mahmoud Hamamdeh because of his Hebrew . The community of Avigail is a small , mixed religious and secular community , situated in a complex political reality , she said . Israelis and Palestinians in this area live together , side by side , and have to be good neighbor , even though they hold diametrically opposed belief , including on their relationship to the land , Malichi said . The Palestinians do not recognize the State of Israel and do not want the Jews living on land that they hold belongs to them , she added . In turn , she said , & ldquo ; we are Zionists and we are returning to . . . the land of the Bible . & rdquo ; Initially , Malichi said , she wa unaware of the attack , a she celebrated the holiday with her family , with a barbecue lunch after service , which included her mother and some of her sibling . Malichi learned about the violence , she said , mostly after the fact . She blamed the incident on a group of teenager that visited the community for the holiday , explaining that it did not represent the people of Avigail itself . The teenager were not properly supervised , she explained . Already when she met them over the holiday , she feared for a situation that could get out of control . Malichi wa also able to speak with the teenager after the incident , so she said she understands that & ldquo ; they did terrible thing . & rdquo ; Malichi added , & ldquo ; I am embarrassed to tell you what they told me , and it can not be justified . & rdquo ; She ha already warned her own teenage son that if he ever engages in such activity , she will personally turn him in to the police . & ldquo ; I can understand why Palestinians threw stone & rdquo ; in response , & rdquo ; she said . This is not how Jews or the resident of Judea and Samaria should behave , she said . Israelis living here should be a force for peace . & ldquo ; Nothing like that ha happened here before , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; This land can no longer tolerate the blood , the hate , and we have to help it love u . It is not the path of this nation to live in hate . & rdquo ; & bull ;",settler versus palestinian : ' this wa a battle for our home '

2020-12-22 20:33:14.363,jpost,"& nbsp ; Portugal would relocate it embassy to Jerusalem only when the city is the capital of both the State of Israel and the state of Palestine , Portuguese Foreign Minister Santos Silva told The Jerusalem Post during his two-day visit . His country ha no plan to follow the United States on this issue , he said a he sat on the veranda of Jerusalem @ @ @ s King David Hotel , located in the western part of the city . Portugal would contemplate such a move he said , only on & quot ; the day when I can put the two embassy in Jerusalem , the embassy of Portugal in Israel and the embassy of Portugal in Palestine . & quot ; When asked if he considered that the location where he sat wa part of Israel , he said , & quot ; I think it is a matter of fact . & quot ; But when it came to the question of whether he considered Jerusalem to be Israel @ @ @ s capital , he said carefully , & quot ; You know the Portuguese Embassy is in Tel Aviv . & quot ; Silva arrived in Israel late Sunday night , on the sideline of a much more publicized visit by US White House senior adviser Jared Kushner on Monday , followed by a departure Tuesday of a joint Israeli-US delegation to Morocco to sign the initial document with regard to the normalization of tie between Jerusalem and Rabat . Silva braved the COVID-19 pandemic to travel visit Israel and the Palestinian territory just day before the Christmas holiday , a part of his preparatory work in advance of his country @ @ @ s January ascendancy to the presidency of Council of the European Union . It @ @ @ s a rotating half year position , which his country will take over from Germany . Germany used that position to attempt to sooth over tension between the EU and Israel on two major issue ; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran . It invited Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi to a meeting of his EU counterpart and spoke of reconvening the EU-Israel Association Council , which last met in 2012 . Silva in Jerusalem spoke of the need for warm Israel-EU tie and of the importance of an EU-Israel Association Council meeting . He noted the point of disagreement with Israel but said that he wanted to address issue from a place of dialogue . In a manner similar to the Germans , he said that Israel @ @ @ s pledge to suspend the annexation of West Bank settlement in exchange for normalization deal with the Untied Arab Emirates and Bahrain had opened the door for improved Israel-EU relation a well . & quot ; It wa important that the normalization process meant suspension of the annexation plan , & quot ; Silva said when he spoke with the Post on Monday night . & quot ; It allowed u to see future conversation and cooperation with Israel in a much more positive way , & quot ; Silva said . He warned that should Israel backtrack on that pledge , the potential of improved Israel-EU tie would be harmed . & quot ; It would be a huge problem for u . It would be an obstacle for deepening the cooperation between the two entity , & quot ; he said . It wa explained to him , Silva said , that & quot ; normalization wa the opposite of annexation . & quot ; Silva spoke positively of the US-brokered Abraham Accords under whose rubric Israeli-Arab deal have been reached . Silva said the Accords breathed life new life into the region and the frozen peace process with the Palestinians . The entry of US President-elect Joe Biden to the White House would also open new possibility in that sphere , he said . & quot ; We have to look carefully at the recent change in the region , and then we have to create condition for the relaunch of direct negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians , & quot ; he said . & quot ; Palestinians and Israelis & quot ; need this , Silva said , adding that the EU want to help facilitate this process . It wa a message that he carried with him when he went to Ramallah on Tuesday before flying back to Portugal in the late afternoon . Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Muhammed Shtayyeh and PA Foreign Minister Riyad Malki both asked that Portugal unilaterally recognize Palestinian statehood . It @ @ @ s a request that Portugal ha rebuffed because it belief that such a step should only be taken by consensus with the entire European Union , and at present the bloc is divided on the issue . The Portuguese parliament ha called on it government to recognize Palestinian statehood ; But to date the EU and the Portuguese government hold that Palestinian statehood recognition could only come upon completion of a final status agreement for a two-state resolution to the conflict . But Portugal and the EU agree with the PA that the contour of a two-state solution should be based on the pre-1967 line with east Jerusalem a the Palestinian capital . Both Portugal and the EU oppose Israeli settlement activity . Silva spoke with Post about this disagreement , explaining that his country and the EU oppose all settlement activity and the Israeli practice of demolishing illegal Palestinian structure . & quot ; We have to pursue our Israeli friend not to pursue the demolition , & quot ; Silva said , adding that he wa particularly concerned by Israel @ @ @ s demolition of EU-funded structure for Palestinians . The EU @ @ @ s decision to pursue such building without permit , which are difficult to obtain , ha been a point of contention between the EU and Israel . He noted that despite the disagreement with Israel , he held the relation between the two country to be very important , both because of the historic tie , and because of the contemporary tie and similar characteristic . & quot ; We are close country , & quot ; he said .",portuguese fm : we @ @ @ ll move embassy when jerusalem is capital of two state
2022-06-13 17:01:50.387,jpost,"The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center on Monday published a report explaining why Hamas did not fire rocket in response to the Jerusalem flag march last month , despite threatening to do so.The decision to back off it threat wa multipronged , according to the intelligence center & rsquo ; s report , which wa prepared by former senior Israeli intelligence people who have ongoing contact with current Israeli intelligence officials.The reasonsFirst , Hamas said it had succeeded in getting Israel to change the path of the march to a less provocative one a far a al-Aqsa Mosque wa concerned . Even though Israel never intended that the flag march route would go near the mosque , Hamas made the statement for propaganda purpose , the report said.Second , Hamas said Israel wa extraordinarily well prepared both because it wa carrying out a major national IDF training exercise and wa on heightened security alert following the Hamas threat . This meant that Hamas would be unable to achieve a surprise a it did in May 2021.Third , Hamas said many country had begged it not to fire rocket . Although the Gaza Strip & rsquo ; s ruler said they had not been influenced by these appeal , their spin doctor put forth the communication a evidence of the increased stature of the organization in the region.As time went on , Hamas became more defensive a it endured more verbal attack from various group in Gaza for having failed to follow through on it threat.Hamas restated some of it original defense for not having attacked in a more apologetic manner , but it also said it wa not the right time to put the Gaza Strip through an entire wide round of conflict with Israel following the May 2021 war.Hamas official said the terrorist group did fire eight rocket on May 28 , the day before the flag march , into the sea , demonstrating that it still had rocket-firing capabilities.Israel responded to that demonstration by sending message to Hamas that it had no intention of escalating the flag march issue , but if Hamas actually fired on Israel , it would face extreme repercussions.Part of Hamas & rsquo ; s problem wa that it leader in the Gaza Strip , Yahya Sinwar , made a very strong speech on April 30 that appeared to directly commit it to conflict with Israel.Ultimately , Hamas & rsquo ; s true intention were not to get Gaza drawn into another conflict , but rather to try to incite east Jerusalem resident , Arab-Israelis and West Bank Palestinians into a conflict with Israel over the flag march , the Meir Amit Center said.In addition , though it is still too early to say , the spring spike in terrorist attack seemed to wane in mid - and late May , and this may have influenced any Hamas plan to inflame the situation , the report said .",why didn ’ t hamas fire rocket at the jerusalem flag march ? - intel report

Jordan view the increased number of visitor a a violation of the status quo.In addition , small number of Jewish visitor have prayed on the Temple Mount , posting video online of themselves doing so , and bringing journalist along . Lapid and the Prime Minister & rsquo ; s Office have said there is no Israeli policy to allow Jews to pray on the Temple Mount , but that stopping every Jew from silent worship is not possible . The foreign minister also expressed discomfort last week with denying Jews freedom of worship , though he said the status quo would not be changed.Amman ha taken issue with the use of the term & ldquo ; freedom of worship & rdquo ; in the context of the Temple Mount because they see it a implying Jews are allowed to pray there.By a longstanding agreement , Jordan & rsquo ; s royal family is the custodian of al-Aqsa and exercise that role mostly through the Wakf . When Israel and Jordan made peace in 1994 , Israel committed to & ldquo ; respect the present , special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrine in Jerusalem . & rdquo ; When Jordan occupied the Old City of Jerusalem from 1949 to 1967 , it did not allow Jews access to the Temple Mount or the Western Wall , despite a formal commitment that it would.Earlier this month , Khasawneh said he & ldquo ; praise every Palestinian and Jordanian Islamic Wakf worker who stand tall like a turret , and those who throw rock at the pro-Zionists who are defiling al-Aqsa Mosque while under the security of the Israeli occupation government . & rdquo ; The Jordanian prime minister also repeated the theory , advanced by the Palestinians and firmly denied by Israel , that the Jewish state plan to divide the Temple Mount into separate space and hour for Jews and Muslims a it did in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron . That theory wa used by group like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the past month to spark riot in Jerusalem.Reuters contributed to this report .",israel will not discus temple mount with jordan after incitement – official

But hero and heroine often depend on how much one know of the story . There are some who would give kudos to Vashti , who defied the king by refusing to appear at his banquet . It & rsquo ; s not certain whether she wa banished or executed by way of punishment , but suffice it to say that she disappeared , and the path wa open for Esther . History might have turned out quite differently had Vashti been more obedient . In fact , there would not be a Purim on which to celebrate.Esther wa neither the first nor the last of Jewish heroine . We have seen ample evidence of that in the current Swords of Iron war.Many book have been written about outstanding Jewish woman . Some have focused on only one ; others , on a group . Former MK Aliza Lavie recently published her book Iconic Jewish Women : Fifty-nine inspiring , courageous , revolutionary role model for young girl . A launch wa held in Jerusalem on Monday night at which Lavie engaged in conversation with Elana Sztokman and Yudit Sidikman . As ambitious a writing a book about 59 inspiring Jewish woman is , it still ha a way to go to catch up with the Encyclopedia of Jewish Women , the comprehensive , historical saga of Jewish woman through the age compiled and written by Alice and Moshe Shalvi , Alice having died right before the Gaza War.Judging by all the female achiever featured at numerous conference this year , future historian focusing on the same subject will have a hard time deciding whom to include.greerfc @ gmail.com",grapevine : eye-opening science

Palacio , the author of the best-selling Wonder , which is referenced at the beginning , it ha moment of heavy kitsch toward the end , but by then you may be so caught up in the story , that you can forgive the lapse . & nbsp ; Were the narrator who tell the story in the framing device anyone other than the incomparable Mirren , one of the greatest actress of all time , White Bird wouldn & rsquo ; t have worked nearly a well a it doe . & nbsp ; What is White Bird about ? The movie open with a short section showing Julian ( Bryce Gheisar ) , Mirren & rsquo ; s grandson , starting at a new , fancy private school in New York . This actor played the same character in Wonder , a bully who tormented the hero because of his facial deformity . At the end of Wonder , he is being transferred to a new school , and in the opening of White Bird , we see him coming home , feeling dejected after a day at that school . The cool kid have rejected him , leading him to be mean to an earnest , uncool minority student who invite him to a political club . When he get into his apartment , he hears a noise and is startled , not expecting anyone , since his parent are usually out at rich people & rsquo ; s fundraiser . As soon a he see that the unexpected visitor is his grandmother , played by Mirren , we are a pleased to see her a he is . & nbsp ; She know the story of how he bullied the other boy and wa made to switch school , and she chides him for being & ldquo ; unkind . & rdquo ; In order to explain to him the importance of kindness , she say she & rsquo ; d like to tell him a story about her girlhood in France during World War II , and we settle down happily because if you can & rsquo ; t see Mirren on screen every moment , the next best thing is hearing her voice . & nbsp ; We then move into the main part of the story , which focus on his grandmother , Sara ( Ariella Glaser ) at the age of 15 , when she wa living in a village in the Alsatian region of France in the early 1940s , where the Nazis were in control but were not harming Jews & ndash ; at first . Sara & rsquo ; s mother ( Olivia Ross ) is a teacher and her father ( Ishai Golan , who is very good in a small role ) is a surgeon , and she ha a comfortable life . Popular at school , she hang out with her girlfriend , ha a crush on the handsomest guy in the class , and is a gifted artist . Her teacher advises her to embrace her artistic gift and not hide her true self . & nbsp ; But soon , there is no hiding the fact that she is Jewish , and after antisemitic law are passed , her father make a plan for them to flee . Before he can put his plan into effect , the Nazis and French collaborator stage a roundup of Jews at Sara & rsquo ; s school . Hiding in the wood , she is approached by Julien ( Orlando Schwerdt ) , a classmate with a limp due to polio , whose father is a workman , who brings her to see his parent ( Gillian Anderson and Jo-Stone Fewings ) , who embrace her unquestioningly and hide her in their barn . They would have taken her into their home but are afraid that their taciturn upstairs neighbor are Nazi supporter . & nbsp ; The heart of the film is the connection that form between Sara and Julien a she realizes she wa wrong to have teased him with her friend and begin to see that she wa spoiled and led a privileged existence up until the Nazi takeover . Julien is considerate and bright , and they begin to fall in love , a they sit in his parent & rsquo ; old car , which is parked in the barn , and imagine they are taking trip around the world . There is a white bird that fly in & ndash ; hence the title & ndash ; and they see it a a harbinger of better time . The young lead are very appealing and this section is lovely , although we know it can & rsquo ; t last . & nbsp ; As White Bird move along , I couldn & rsquo ; t help wishing that the movie had allowed it compelling , mostly young cast and the power of it story to carry the drama , without resorting , in the final 15 minute or so , to speech that are so literal they are unnecessary and annoying and a few other quasi-supernatural flourish , almost a magic realism approach . I know this sort of storytelling ha it fan , but I feel that in a Holocaust narrative , it & rsquo ; s more effective and more honest to stick close to the truth . However , I understand that this is meant to be a film that will attract teen and tweens , a well a their parent , and so an approach that showed the horror in a realistic way & ndash ; like in the movie , & nbsp ; Son of Saul & ndash ; wa not in the card here . Everyone speaks English with slight accent , too , and you just have to accept that . & nbsp ; Despite it flaw , it doe not trivialize the Holocaust , and just barely manages to avoid being part of that mini-genre I have named & ldquo ; Feel-Good Holocaust Films . & rdquo ; There have been other Holocaust movie that have made egregious and dishonest evasion , softening the horror in a misguided attempt to attract audience , such a The Boy in the Striped Pajamas or La Rafle ( & ldquo ; The Round Up & rdquo ; ) , which wa also set in France . I wrote about La Rafle , in a review titled , & ldquo ; The Good , the Bad , and the Cute , & rdquo ; that , & ldquo ; A viewer who knew nothing of the true event of World War II would think there wa a guardian angel that looked out for sweet young child . & rdquo ; In White Bird , at least , it is clear that innocent people , even very cute one , suffered terribly at the hand of the Nazis and their collaborator , and even paid with their life . The two likable young lead and Mirren elevate this to a film that doe have genuinely touching moment and I hope it will be seen by the young viewer it seems to have been made for . & nbsp ;",' white bird ' : a holocaust movie saved by helen mirren - review

The chance of getting to the hospital alive were really small . & rdquo ; Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa , where the two men are being treated , announced Monday that their condition were improving . One of them regained consciousness and is expected to be removed from a ventilator , and ha communicated with his family . The other is scheduled to undergo a lengthy operation for his wound . The two troop , a platoon commander and his soldier , were seriously injured during a firefight in the West Bank village of Burkin when they engaged armed Palestinian terrorist . The IDF & rsquo ; s preliminary investigation is looking into the circumstance surrounding their injury but is leaning towards the possibility that they were injured by friendly fire . One of the men wa shot in the chest and lost one of his lung while the other man wa shot in the jaw and stomach . The two are also suffering from shrapnel wound . & ldquo ; They were very seriously injured . . . and from the moment they were shot , the 18-year-old EMT-P went straight to treat them . The time we have to get to an injured person and give them medical treatment is second , & rdquo ; the officer said , adding that while & ldquo ; most army around the world have their paramedic in the back , in the IDF they are in the front . & rdquo ; According to the officer , Sgt . T controlled the hemorrhaging of the soldier to stop their bleeding , performed a chest drainage , and intubated one of the men . The paramedic also did three additional thing that saved the life of the troop : he provided freeze-dried plasma , gave them TXA and actively decided only to intubate one of them . The powdered , freeze-dried plasma given to the troop helped to clot their blood and prevented the badly wounded men from bleeding to death on the battlefield . TXA ( tranexamic acid ) meanwhile help to stabilize the patient by coagulating the blood . Both were carried in the vest of the paramedic . Then he chose to go outside the protocol and not to do something . & ldquo ; Our reflex is to go to someone who is severely injured and intubate them . But , what we & rsquo ; ve found over the last decade is that such a decision is not always best . If you have a bleeding problem then intubation might help , but if you are bleeding and have low blood pressure it can actually harm the patient , & rdquo ; the senior officer said . & ldquo ; We & rsquo ; ve found that with specific type of casualty , intubation actually hastens their death because you put pressure on the lung and heart and reduce their already low blood pressure even more . & rdquo ; Had Sgt . T intubated the second man who had been shot in the lung , & ldquo ; he might not have made it to the hospital . & rdquo ; It wa a & ldquo ; very challenging scenario & rdquo ; and the paramedic & ldquo ; did a really great job under fire , & rdquo ; the senior medical officer said . & ldquo ; We all do our best to save our troop . There & rsquo ; s no technology in the world that we don & rsquo ; t use . We are very aggressive in adopting new technology and even admitting when we are wrong . We keep on changing , all the time . & rdquo ; According to the officer , it took approximately an hour from the time the two were injured until they reached Rambam in Haifa . They were evacuated by helicopter and given several whole blood transfusion while en route . When they reached the hospital , their Ph level wa so severe that their life were at risk . & ldquo ; Just imagine what their state could have been had they not received all the treatment that they did in the field . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen .

The strike were authorized a a response to attack against American and coalition personnel in Iraq . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Specifically , the strike destroyed multiple facility located at a border control point used by a number of Iranian-backed military group , including Kataib Hezbollah and Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada , & rdquo ; the US said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It wa a deliberate and planned retaliation , & rdquo ; the US said in an unambiguous message , adding that it would act to protect American personnel . & nbsp ; The report of Israeli airstrikes on Sunday in Syria come in the wake of the visit by US Central Command Air Force Commander Lt . - Gen . Gregory Guillot to Israel on Friday . The visit underpinned & ldquo ; strategic cooperation with American force , & rdquo ; IAF Commander Maj . - Gen . Amikam Norkin said . & nbsp ; The double blow to Iran from the US and Israel is not the first time Iran ha been hit in Syria by both country . Israel had carried out more than 1,000 airstrikes against Iranian target in Syria , according to January 2019 report . That number is likely closer to 1,500 airstrikes by now . The US carried out retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian-backed force in Syria in December 2019 after an attack that killed a contractor at K-1 base in Iraq . & nbsp ; In January , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged US intelligence support for Israeli airstrikes in Syria , according to Al-Monitor , a Washington-based news website . Can the US force Iran out of Syria , pondered Jared Szuba in a piece at Al-Monitor last December . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Are we ever going to get to a place where Iran doe not have force in Syria ? & rdquo ; Michael Mulroy , a former US deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East , asked during a think-tank event on December 17 , the report noted . & ldquo ; I mean , people that are smarter on this than I have told me , no , that & rsquo ; s not going to happen . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Mulroy , a veteran CIA paramilitary officer who worked on Syria during his time at the Pentagon , suggested that minimizing Tehran & rsquo ; s influence in the Levant should remain a US goal , & rdquo ; Szuba wrote . & ldquo ; & lsquo ; Maybe we should have a smarter take to it , & rsquo ; he added . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; It is known that the US under the previous administration , including national security advisor John Bolton and secretary of state Mike Pompeo , sought to support Israel & rsquo ; s action regarding Iran & rsquo ; s entrenchment in Syria . & nbsp ; Iran rapidly increased entrenchment since 2018 , and Iran & rsquo ; s force have suffered accordingly . A strike in June 2018 hit a KH headquarters in Albukamal . Iraqi medium at the time , reporting statement by the pro-Iranian Hashd al-Shaabi , blamed the US and Israel for the strike . & nbsp ; IN AN interview in January , former US Syria envoy James Jeffrey showcased how Israel and the US are working together in Syria . In Foreign Affairs , the former American envoy on Syrian policy said : & ldquo ; US-supported Israeli strike on Iranian target in the country further limited the [ Syrian ] regime & rsquo ; s military option . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Jeffrey also told Szuba in an interview for Al-Monitor about the US support for Israeli airstrikes in Syria . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The US only began supporting that when I came on board , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; I went out there and we saw Prime Minister [ Benjamin ] Netanyahu and others , and they thought that they were not being supported enough by the US military , and not by intelligence . And there wa a big battle within the US government , and we won the battle . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The argument [ against supporting Israel & rsquo ; s campaign ] wa , again , this obsession with the counterterrorism mission . People didn & rsquo ; t want to screw with it , either by worrying about Turkey or diverting resource to allow the Israelis to muck around in Syria , a maybe that will lead to some blowback to our force . It hasn & rsquo ; t . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Supporting Israel in Syria wa a pillar of US policy on Syria . & nbsp ; The changeover in US administration in January led to many question about whether the US would continue to support Israel & rsquo ; s freedom of action in Syria and also whether the US would respond to Iranian attack . Now we know that the support appears to be continuing and that both Israel and the US are willing to strike Iranian-backed force or threat in Syria . & nbsp ; Linking Syria to Iran & rsquo ; s attack elsewhere is a key aspect of the strike over the last several day . That mean Iran may be getting a message that if it doe something in the Gulf of Oman , it militia could be targeted 2,000 kilometer away . The US appears to have said the same thing . & nbsp ; The idea that the militia unit in Syria are responsible for guiding policy that target a ship in the Gulf of Oman or strike at a sensitive location in Erbil appears overwrought . It is the linkage and messaging and context of US support for Israeli action in Syria that is important . & nbsp ; David Shor , who commentates on regional issue , noted on Twitter in a thread on the attack : & ldquo ; Time will tell before we can ascertain precisely what wa attacked tonight in Syria , and whether these target can be differentiated at all from the hundred of others targeted over the year in Syria . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; That is a key point , beyond the linkage , of what the strike have hit and whether this matter to Iran . & nbsp ; Airstrikes have long been part of a larger Clausewitz-style , air-power diplomacy in the region , whereby an action in one place result in a reaction in another . & nbsp ; For instance , Iran wa establishing a permanent military base in Syria at Al-Kiswah , a & ldquo ; Western intelligence source & rdquo ; told the BBC in November 2017 . Al-Kiswah ha been struck several time since then , in May 2018 , June 2019 and in January 2021 . & nbsp ; Airstrikes in eastern Syria on Iranian-linked target were carried out by Israel with intelligence provided by the US , a senior US intelligence official said this January . & nbsp ; There is now a long timeline from the Kiswah revelation in November 2017 , the warning about Iranian entrenchment in 2017 and 2018 , the increasing entrenchment , the strike on the Hezbollah killer-drone team near the Golan Heights in August 2019 and then the revelation of increased US support for Israel & rsquo ; s action in 2020 , a well a US airstrikes against Iranian element in Syria in 2019 and now in 2021 . & nbsp ; The map of Israel-US involvement in Syria is growing and converging on Iran & rsquo ; s network of base in the region , which stretch across it plethora of proxy force from Iraq to Lebanon . This may pave the way for increased US-Israel cooperation in the region , or at least underpin a shared strategy .",israel-us attack against iran in syria pave way for increased cooperation

As the scroll wa written while the country of both president had been unlawfully attacked and were at war , the two president dedicated the Torah scroll to peace and unity.Unity through Torah : Israel-Ukraine connectionThe initiative for the writing of the scroll came from Chabad emissary Rabbi Yonatan Markovitch , who is also the chief rabbi of Kyiv . Markovitch devotes much time and energy to strengthening solidarity between Israel and Ukraine . The writing of the Torah scroll began shortly after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine , and in writing the first letter , Zelensky returned to his Jewish roots.Herzog is not the only Israeli to have written a letter in the Kyiv Torah Scroll .

As long a the IDF doe not rein in the settler , attack such a this one will continue , Palestinians contend . Such attack , however , are not necessarily linked to a specific action by settler .

Palestinians who go out to attack settler and soldier on the road of the West Bank are often influenced by the reporting in their own medium and the rhetoric of Palestinian official and spokesman . The rise in rock-throwing incident in the past few day may also be linked to the ruling Fatah faction & rsquo ; s celebration of the 56th anniversary of it first attempted terrorist attack against Israel , a well a the 33rd anniversary of the First Intifada in December 1987 .

The attack often take place in area under Israeli security control , where the Palestinian security force are not permitted to operate , Palestinian official say .

Everyone wa on the edge of their seat . Less than a month since a ceasefire wa signed , wa Israel set to go back to war ? & nbsp ; Throughout the day & nbsp ; incendiary and explosive balloon & nbsp ; landed in southern Israel , igniting more than 20 fire , but no rocket were fired . & nbsp ; Israel had deployed Iron Dome battery close to the capital , reinforced battery in the South and had thousand of Border Police officer secure the march . There were several injury and arrest during the controversial march , but overall the day ended with quiet in the capital . & nbsp ; The Iron Dome battery that had been deployed close to the capital stayed silent . Instead of rocket-warning siren , the siren of fire truck rushing to the scene were heard . & nbsp ; The way that the two side handled the day show just how much restraint they employed , because neither Hamas nor Israel want to go back to war so soon after the last round in May . & nbsp ; Hamas , which pushed itself into a corner with it threat and promise to the Palestinian people that it is the protector of al-Quds and al-Aqsa Mosque , resorted to it pressure tactic of balloon and night demonstration along the border , instead of rocket fire . & nbsp ; But the balloon and demonstration were not launched solely because of the flag march ; the group is also trying to pressure Israel into letting the million of dollar of Qatari cash into Gaza , a well a restart the fuel transfer into the blockaded coastal enclave . & nbsp ; Hamas know it can not afford another war right now , especially with Egyptians in the Strip handling all aid sent . Egypt is an instrumental player when Israel and Gaza go to war , and Hamas know that angering it neighbor to the south would not be the smartest move on it part . & nbsp ; A key strategic ally for Israel , Cairo had reconnaissance plane in the air over northern Sinai and off the Gazan coast throughout the day , likely to watch for any move inside Gaza that would point to preparation of rocket fire . & nbsp ; If it want to , Hamas can keep the quiet ; we have seen that over and over again . And not only did it prevent any fire from it operative on Tuesday , but it made sure that Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other group toed the line a well . & nbsp ; But the terrorist group still claimed victory , saying that it imposed a new set of rule on Israel following the 11 day of conflict . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The courageous stance of the Palestinian resistance , and it decisive decision that forced the Israeli occupation to change the path of the so-called March of Flags away from the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque , change the path of civil aviation , and intensify the deployment of the Iron Dome , confirm the achievement of the deterrence equation it imposed in the Battle of Saif al-Quds , and it success in imposing new rule of engagement on the enemy , & rdquo ; the group said Tuesday night . & nbsp ; THE DAY wa a test for Israel under the new government of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett , a well . & nbsp ; Bennett is a known hawk on defense issue . Shortly after he began his term a defense minister in November 2018 , he warned Hamas that & ldquo ; no one will be immune & rdquo ; from Israeli military action . The response to the launching of explosive balloon from the Strip would be similar to the launching of rocket , he said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The lawless conduct of Hamas leadership is bringing u closer to fatal action against them . We will not announce when or where , but no one will be immune , & rdquo ; Bennett said at the time . & nbsp ; And he ha kept repeating that . & nbsp ; So overnight , IDF jet carried out strike against empty Hamas and PIJ compound . They were the first airstrikes since the ceasefire and a warning to Hamas : we will not sit back quietly . But doe hitting empty compound at night do anything to deter the group ? Israeli official have said over and over again that & ldquo ; what wa , will not be , & rdquo ; so in order to stay true to their word , the Israel Air Force could have hit a target with more significance . & nbsp ; Opposition MK Israel Katz ( Likud ) tweeted Wednesday morning that & ldquo ; for every attack in Israel , targeted assassination and widespread attack on Hamas target should be carried out . Not empty compound . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Perhaps the Israelis were also walking a tightrope , knowing that widespread attack in the Strip would not be welcomed by Cairo and could instead lead to a diplomatic crisis that Bennett could not afford so soon into his term . & nbsp ; Both Israel and Gaza have firepower to cause extensive damage , but no matter the threat by leader in Jerusalem or Gaza , both side are restrained both by Cairo and by their own internal issue .","hamas , israel do not want war despite threat - analysis"

Dan Diker , President of the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs , at the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference on Monday.Diker & rsquo ; s observation prefaced a discussion he conducted at the conference with Mossab Hassan Yousef , & nbsp ; & ldquo ; the Green Prince , & rdquo ; son of Hamas co-founder Sheikh Hassan Yousef . Yousef defected to Israel in 1997 and worked a a spy for the Shin Bet until he moved to the United States in 2007 . & nbsp ; Diker characterized the Hamas attack of October 7 a a & ldquo ; strategic surprise & rdquo ; along the line of major event such a 911 and Pearl Harbor . & ldquo ; At the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs , what shocked u wa the glee , the energy , and the enthusiasm for Hamas in the free world , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; He described the expectation in the US and much of the Western alliance that support the creation of a Palestinian state & ldquo ; on the heel of the worst massacre and mass murder in modern political history on a single day of any democratic country . & ldquo ; The free world , in large part , belief that this [ the war ] is an extension of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict . Our understanding , and Israel & rsquo ; s understanding a a national consensus issue is completely different . & rdquo ; Diker noted that in the eye of many in the West , & ldquo ; Israel ha been recast a Hamas , and Hamas , from the point of view of virtue , legitimacy , and justice , ha been recast a Israel . This inversion of legitimacy ha been taking place over the last 31 year & nbsp ; since the Oslo Accords , and it is time that we stop defending ourselves intellectually & nbsp ; and & nbsp ; morally . & nbsp ; We must move from intellectual & nbsp ; defense & nbsp ; to offense reflected in an assertive diplomacy . & rdquo ; Diker presented the result of a JCFA poll released at the Jpost conference that showed that 79 % of Israelis opposed the establishment of Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank that could threaten Ben Gurion Airport and Israel & rsquo ; s coastal city . Notably , the poll also showed that 64 % of Israelis rejected a Palestinian state , even if accompanied by Saudi normalization . Diker noted that these finding affirmed the Knesset vote in which an unprecedented 99 MKs opposed US endorsement of a Palestinian state . & nbsp ; The second part of the discussion wa led by Yousef , who said that the ideological dimension of the war can not be ignored . & ldquo ; Palestine is a device that the Muslims use a a weapon against Israel and a a weapon against the Jewish people . Fundamentally , Muslims think that Allah hate the Jewish people . & rdquo ; Yousef said that it wa unacceptable for Muslims to take the side of a terrorist group that committed unforgivable crime in the name of & ldquo ; resistance & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; occupation . & rdquo ; He voiced his opposition to a two-state solution with a Palestinian state led by the Palestinian Authority . & ldquo ; For those representing a two-state solution , they either want Israel to cease to exist , or they are not aware of this existential threat , & rdquo ; he declared . He added that in his opinion , the Palestinian Authority is an even greater threat than Hamas . & nbsp ; Diker announced that the organization is changing it name to the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs , reflecting it activity in that sphere . & ldquo ; We see ourselves a the engine for Israel & rsquo ; s foreign affair , serving a a bridge between the West and the Arab Muslim majority East . & rdquo ; It will lead research-driven strategic and communication initiative for the security and prosperity of Israel , it & nbsp ; Abraham Accord partner , and prospective ally seeking normalization with Israel . & nbsp ; The Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs sponsored a portion of the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference . & nbsp ; www.jpost.com/AC24",jcfa head dan diker : ' we really have to think out of the box '

They claimed that Hamas , which ha been ruling Gaza since 2007 , did not want to engage in another major military confrontation with Israel out of fear of losing control over the coastal enclave.Hamas , they added , is aware that the Palestinians in Gaza are not ready for another war , in light of the heavy price they paid during last year & rsquo ; s Israel-Hamas war.Other critic of Hamas claimed that it leader were not really sorry to see their competitor in Islamic Jihad , the second-largest armed group in Gaza , be dealt a severe blow a a result of the IDF & rsquo ; s military strikes.Over the past few year , report in several Palestinian and Arab medium outlet have referred to rising tension between Hamas and Islamic Jihad.According to the report , Hamas is unhappy that Islamic Jihad is becoming a dominant and independent force inside Gaza.The tension reached their peak last year after source there revealed that member of Hamas & rsquo ; s Izzadin al-Qassam Brigades detained Islamic Jihad militiaman who were planning to launch rocket toward Israel.Hamas , the source said , wa also worried about the growing cooperation between Islamic Jihad and other terrorist group inside Gaza , including those linked to the Fatah faction , the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine , a well a tiny Islamic State-inspired cells.Leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad held a series of meeting over the past few month in Gaza and Lebanon , a part of an attempt to ease the tension and restore the military and civilian cooperation between the two sides.The two group are now claiming that one of Israel & rsquo ; s main goal behind Operation Breaking Dawn wa to set them against each other , and that the talk in Israel about Hamas & rsquo ; s decision to sit on the fence during the fighting aim to & ldquo ; sow discord and division & rdquo ; among the Palestinians.In keeping with this claim , the leader of Hamas and Islamic Jihad are now boasting that they actually managed to thwart the alleged Israeli conspiracy to create dissension among the Palestinians.That & rsquo ; s why it wa important for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and other leader of his group to call the family of the Islamic Jihad member who were killed during the fighting to offer their condolences.The Hamas leader also went to extreme length to emphasize the importance of maintaining a & ldquo ; unified front & rdquo ; in the battle against Israel , to show that their relation with their Islamic Jihad & ldquo ; brother & rdquo ; remains a strong a ever.The assessment among Palestinians in Gaza is that Hamas ha emerged a one of the winner from the Israel-Islamic Jihad confrontation .

However , many of those family are from poor socioeconomic background and can not afford to pay for extended stay in hotel . Donors sent the organization fund to help pay for such family . & ldquo ; Ultimately , we also were able to get a donation from someone in America that enabled u to pay for short-term rental for some of the family , `` Tyberg said . `` We were calling all the real estate agent if there were any empty apartment and trying to find place for people to stay . & rdquo ; Meanwhile , veteran American non-profit organization Anera ( American Near East Refugee Aid ) provides humanitarian and development aid to refugee in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , Jordan , and Lebanon . & nbsp ; Sandra Rasheed , the organization 's country director for Palestine , told The Media Line that while Anera 's operational approach ha remained unchanged during the war , it ha significantly intensified it effort to aid civilian in Gaza . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We started almost 55 year ago . It started in 1967 after the [ Six-Day ] war that left so many Palestinians displaced , `` Rasheed said . `` It wa created by Palestinian-Americans , Arab-Americans , people who are interested in social justice , who wanted to find a way to support the mass exodus of Palestinians out of Palestine . Prior to this war , we worked in education , focusing on early childhood development , shelter , food security , health , medical donation , and community infrastructure . All of that wa put on hold . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; It is estimated that some 1.9 million Gazans , over 85 % of the population , have been displaced in the current war , and the World Health Organization ha reported an increase in disease attributed to overcrowded condition in the refuge area . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Since the response started , we have distributed more than 6 million meal to people who have been displaced . That includes food parcel , vegetable basket , and hot meal , `` Rasheed said . & nbsp ; `` We have facilitated 55 psychosocial session for child , so they have guided activity for play and stress relief . We have 55 shelter that we clean on a rotation basis . It 's not just our team that is working . We 've been able to mobilize a network of over about 450 volunteer , partner , farmer , vendor , and other partner organization to support u in the work that we 're doing . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The formidable challengesBoth woman acknowledge encountering formidable challenge in delivering assistance.Tyberg said that urgent call from displaced Israelis seeking assistance are repeatedly forced to end abruptly because of rocket alert . & ldquo ; I would say that the hardest part for all the people here in the organization and all the volunteer wa really that point where we had just gotten hundred of phone call coming in from family who were desperate . They would suddenly tell u there wa a warning siren and hang up , `` she said . `` We would wait by the phone fearing for their life . Then they would call back , like , 20 minute later and say , ' OK , everything 's OK . So , listen , when could you come and get u out of here ? We 're desperate . We need a place to go . ' & rdquo ; & nbsp ; In the Gaza Strip , one of the major challenge faced by many volunteer and worker is fear for their own life . & ldquo ; We try to provide the coordinate so that people , so Israel , know that these are shelter for staff of an American organization working for the displaced , `` Rasheed said . `` But our team have said time and time again that if we 're going to die , we 're going to die serving our people . We 're going to die serving the people that need support . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Rasheed said that fuel is crucial to the organization 's ability to deliver food to Gazans . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Our work is reliant on being able to deliver the food to people in shelter , `` she said . `` Having our team go to these shelter and provide the intervention and fuel is more precious than gold right now , and it 's one of the hardest thing to attain . And without fuel , we ca n't operate . & rdquo ; Tyberg said the war is exacting a heavy psychological and emotional toll on the Israeli population . `` There are just so many people who know people who 've been affected terribly . And it 's just this very heavy feeling that we all have that it 's just inescapable , just hanging over everyone , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Rasheed called for a permanent cease-fire to end the conflict . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I think what we 're asking for is people to advocate for a permanent cease-fire . The situation is very critical . We need a permanent cease-fire . We need a solution , `` she said.Lana Ikelan is a recent graduate of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and an intern in The Media Line & rsquo ; s Press and Policy Student Program .","for both israeli and palestinian , ngo offer essential support during war"
2021-05-18 23:34:04.153,jpost,"The current campaign between Israel and Hamas is the fiercest one since the 2014 war . It should end because of several reason . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s Iron Dome is successful in intercepting rocket , but a the campaign continues , the chance that one or several rocket will cause heavy Israeli casualty rapidly increase . A significant blow , harming dozen of Israelis , might push Israel to launch a large-scale ground offensive , deep inside the Gaza Strip . Such an attack might seek to defeat Hamas once and for all , but toppling it rule would likely force Israel into the position of conquering the Strip altogether , an outcome Israel doe not ultimately desire . & nbsp ; The Gaza Strip is a small area ( 365 square kilometer ) , and it ha been highly monitored by Israel , making it easier for the IDF to gather vital information about Hamas and other group there . The IDF also ha been training to confront Hamas . Nevertheless , in retaking the Gaza Strip , hundred of Israeli troop will be killed or injured , fighting their foe above and underground . & nbsp ; Hamas dug long tunnel in the Gaza Strip , preparing itself for war , including a part of an IDF territorial seizure . The fight would therefore not be over after the IDF captured the entire Gaza Strip . The IDF would have to destroy the existing military infrastructure . Palestinian combatant , not only from Hamas , would aspire to harm Israelis , including taking them a prisoner . Israelis in the Gaza Strip would inevitably be target for ambush , IEDs , etc . & nbsp ; As in prior similar campaign , Israel ha relied on firepower , mostly through aircraft , to make significant achievement . However , these accomplishment fall short of the chance for complete victory . Since Israel will not retake the Gaza Strip , Hamas will keep it base , recover and produce additional and more sophisticated rocket and missile with longer range , accuracy etc . Following Israeli strike , Hamas might need month , and in certain area , year to rebuild it strength . Hamas , including it naval commando , were hit hard . Overall , Israel managed to inflict Hamas quite a blow in this round . & nbsp ; Israel theorizes that more strike in the current round will be adequate to cripple the military wing of Hamas , delaying another round , but there is no guarantee of that . Hamas will still have a capability to challenge Israel . & nbsp ; This round started following clash in Jerusalem , which are capable of occurring again at any time for a variety of reason . Israel need to be careful in this matter , but predicting in advance what will ignite riot , let alone another round with Hamas , is a speculative undertaking . The latter can easily rely on friction between Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem a an excuse for striking Israel , producing yet another extended campaign . & nbsp ; Hamas is an Iranian proxy , although independent in many respect . Its self-determination ha been demonstrated in several instance , such a when it refused to fight for Assad , Iran & rsquo ; s ally , during the Syrian civil war . Nevertheless , Iran recognizes the importance of Hamas due to it location , near Israel , and since it is Sunni . The mostly Shi & rsquo ; ite Iran us this religious factor to present itself a one that assist Sunnis , and not only Shi & rsquo ; ite group such a Hezbollah . & nbsp ; IN RECENT YEARS , Iranian training and knowledge helped Hamas upgrade it missile and rocket , with the result being shown in this latest round . Iran hereby hit Israel indirectly , a part of the ongoing conflict between them . Israel return the favor by bombing Iranian target inside Syria , and by conducting covert operation against Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s most crucial national security concern is stopping or at least delaying the development of Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . It is a top priority for Israel , more important than any issue Israel ha with Hamas or any other national security concern for that matter . & nbsp ; Talks between Iran , the United States , and other power about containing Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program are ongoing . Israel doe not have much leverage in those negotiation , but a long a Israel is occupied with Hamas , Israel can not focus on what matter most : handling Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . In that sense , Hamas serf Iran even if Hamas fight Israel for it own reason . This is another major reason why Israel should end the current campaign with Hamas . & nbsp ; Israel and the United States have close tie , but the Biden administration doe not have very friendly relation with the Israeli government . Israel need it American patron in order to reach the best outcome for the current round with Hamas . Israel relies much more on the United States to make sure the talk with Iran will be effective at restraining Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . & nbsp ; If Israel annoys the Biden administration with respect to the Gaza Strip , the United States might be less willing to listen to Israel about Iran . The Biden administration lends Israel time in fighting Hamas but it is clear the Biden administration want this campaign to subside . If Israel insists on persisting with this round , it risk increasing friction with the Biden administration . The Gaza Strip ha been under the rule of Hamas since 2007 . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Hamas , due to it mismanagement and eagerness to confront Israel , caused a deep economic and social crisis in the Gaza Strip . Some predict that this area might collapse , driving thousand of desperate Palestinians to infiltrate Israel and ask for help . Obviously , Israel doe not prefer this outcome . If Israel continues with this round , the probability of further decline in the Gaza Strip increase . & nbsp ; Many Arab state oppose Hamas , and some , like those in the Gulf , have tie with Israel . Arab state can & rsquo ; t openly support Israel in this round , fearing public opinion inside their country and across the Arab world . Arab criticism of Israel is not a pronounced a it used to be , but this can easily change for the worse . The longer this round is continued , the higher the burden of casualty amongst the Palestinian population will reach , forcing even Arab state that have normalized relation with Israel , to speak and maybe even to act against Israel . & nbsp ; All in all , ending the current campaign will frustrate many in Israel who wish to defeat Hamas . However , Israel should cut it loss , and not extend this campaign , because it is simply not worth the cost and the risk . & nbsp ; Dr . Ehud Eilam ha been dealing with and studying Israel & rsquo ; s national security for more than 25 year . He served in the Israeli military and later worked for the Defense Ministry a a researcher .

2023-02-26 20:41:34.677,jpost,"Some see the world in one or two dimension and others in three . When Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , who also ha a portfolio within the Defense Ministry , responded to the Palestinian terrorist attack in which two Jews were murdered in Huwara in the northern West Bank by calling for using tank and helicopter against the Palestinians , he certainly wa not thinking three-dimensionally.Nor wa National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir , who picked a fight with the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) , which recommended unsealing the residence of a terrorist who killed three Jews earlier in February.These view are indicative of narrow thinking . Lessons from the Second Intifada and the Knife Intifada showed that substantially increased IDF physical presence in West Bank area , especially Palestinian area , were part of the necessary mix of ingredient for restoring calm and security.But that presence rarely involved tank and helicopter & ndash ; blunt instrument for open battlefield or for targeting large , concentrated enemy positions.Those position do not exist in the West Bank , which doe not have the massive volume of rocket , other destructive weapon and well-structured Hamas militia that exist in Gaza.Why wo n't tank , helicopter in the West Bank secure quiet with the Palestinians ? The Palestinian Authority , while it might not control all area and might be turning a blind eye to terrorist element , is actively avoiding conflict with the IDF . Non-PA terrorist element do not pose anywhere near the same magnitude of threat a Hamas . Neither do they present a useful large target for tank or helicopters.Militarily , the tactic that worked before , and would likely work now if it need to be unleashed , would involve huge number of soldier going door to door , with intelligence support from drones.Likewise , despite Ben-Gvir & rsquo ; s attack on the Shin Bet , the security agency ha been a big supporter of house demolition to deter future terrorism.However , part of the Shin Bet & rsquo ; s rationale is that Palestinians know in their heart of heart that the agency is focused on family who hold some joint responsibility for the terrorism of their family members.In contrast , the Shin Bet found that the Ramot terrorist from earlier this month wa psychologically unstable and that the family did not assist him in any way and might even have tried to temper his violent leanings.A house demolition in that case could just create more terrorist , even according to the Shin Bet , because not a single Palestinian would see it a legitimate.But the Second Intifada wa also brought under control by the eventual completion of the West Bank security barrier to limit infiltrations.One problem in a dimension where using force can not solve everything & ndash ; and tank and helicopter are useless and impractical to police a long border & ndash ; is that , a IDF source told The Jerusalem Post , completing those portion of the barrier where Palestinians are still sneaking through into sovereign Israel could take another 18 months.And this doesn & rsquo ; t even address east Jerusalem , where there is not any initiative being entertained that could handle the security situation . Arabs from east Jerusalem travel freely in Israel . Even presuming that nearly all of them aren & rsquo ; t looking to act against Israel , anyone with violent intention is unrestrained . Tanks and helicopter are even less relevant there.Sunday & rsquo ; s terrorist attack occurred in an overlapping Palestinian area , where Palestinians and Israelis mix , the least secure type of location.The Knife Intifada wa partially put down by Israeli security force using social medium and drone surveillance to predict and prevent terrorist attack by & ldquo ; lone wolf & rdquo ; attacker before they happened . Yet , many say another ingredient to ending the Second Intifada wa Israel & rsquo ; s announced withdrawal from Gaza.In contrast , there is currently no diplomatic dimension ( or & ldquo ; carrot & rdquo ; ) on the table from Israel to follow a new Operation Defensive Shield ( or & ldquo ; stick & rdquo ; ) , such a then-prime minister Ariel Sharon used.In parallel to demolishing more house , taking away terrorist & rsquo ; citizenship and calling for capital punishment for terrorist , the current government is also in negotiation with the PA , Jordan and Egypt to try to calm the broader situation before it transforms into another intifada . Part of the & ldquo ; deal & rdquo ; that seems to have emerged includes freezing unilateral action on both side for some months.For Israel , this referred to new settlement and outpost , whereas for the Palestinians , it might have referred to legal move against Israel in the UN system.But a those effort continue , element of the coalition oppose any dialogue whatsoever with any Palestinians , even though the Shin Bet belief dialogue is critical to restoring security cooperation with the PA.In past year , some intelligence official told the Post that the PA had helped Israel stop 20 % or more of terrorist attack against Israel & ndash ; not insignificant number . And tank and helicopter in the West Bank would not make thing quieter with Hamas in Gaza.To date , the current government ha failed to convince Hamas to fully disconnect itself from issue with Palestinians in other conflict areas.All of this come down to the idea that using force , and more of it , may absolutely be part of the equation to end the almost yearlong up-and-down current wave of violence.But there will also likely need to be a & ldquo ; carrot & rdquo ; in there somewhere , whether economic , diplomatic or both . Might the new deal be enough in this area , or is it inadequate to escape the current quagmire ? Other ingredient could be the unfinished security barrier in the West Bank , which will take time , coming up with a unique security solution to east Jerusalem security issue and figuring out a way to restore deterrence with Hamas in Gaza.This would mean the current government will need to try some new and creative idea on multiple playing field instead of only doubling down with populist slogan in one dimension.There are many idea , short of a messianic peace vision , that can help restore calm , and the latest deal might help with that . But tank and helicopter are either a tiny part or a nonexistent part of the solution .","could tank , helicopter secure quiet in w . bank with palestinian ? - analysis"

The official say that the collapse of the PA could cause a similar situation to that in Gaza , where Hamas seized control in 2007 . They argue that the PA & rsquo ; s loss of control , particularly in the northern West Bank , ha empowered terrorist group and forced the IDF to conduct counter-terror operation in the territory . & nbsp ; Ben-Gvir called the decision to strengthen the PA & ldquo ; delusional . & rdquo ; He said : & ldquo ; There is no greater absurdity than the fact that a body that encourages terrorism , pay salary to terrorist and their family , encourages in the education system incitement in favor of the murder of Jews , and take over territory in Judea and Samaria , will receive a basket of reward from the Israeli government in the midst of a wave of terrorism . & rdquo ; It is worth noting that the Israeli government collect some NIS 800 million annually in tax for the PA , accounting for up to 70 % of it revenue , excluding foreign aid . & nbsp ; On July 10 , the PA rejected Israel & rsquo ; s demand for helping to prevent it collapse . & ldquo ; Yesterday , the Israeli government came out with decision concerning the Palestinian Authority on the pretext that they want to offer gesture to the Palestinians , & rdquo ; PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told a PA cabinet meeting . & ldquo ; On behalf of the Palestinian government , we say that what is required of Israel is to halt it aggression on our people , killing , settlement , and the piracy of our money . & rdquo ; Established 30 year ago a part of the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords with Israel , the PA ha weakened considerably over recent year amid allegation of corruption and incompetence , and opposition to it security cooperation with Israel .

There is also an increasing number of woman in higher ranking career-track job in the IDF , with two major-general , seven brigadier-generals , 51 colonel , and 486 lieutenant-colonels.If before , one of the last remaining objection of doubter wa that IDF woman could perform stationary guard duty but that when a real war came they would be a liability , all of the data and narrative from Oct . 7 and after suggest that female combat fighter performed at high level under the most extreme possible conditions.Corp . Maya Atilas of the Gaza Division & rsquo ; s Border Defense Unit told the Magazine about her Oct . 7 experience on the southern front.After the massacre , she felt the IDF would have easily let her switch to a lower-risk position , but she insisted on staying , explaining , & ldquo ; It wa personal for me that it wa important to do because also maybe someone would say woman would not be able to continue , but I couldn & rsquo ; t quit . No matter how hard it wa to go back to the lookout post , I will continue . & ldquo ; I understand the importance . The combat fighter need u so much . The most significant message for all young woman who are afraid of taking this job in the IDF : The mission is so important . It is the greatest pride you can have , & rdquo ; she said.Besides some of the above individual story , there wa also encouraging data month into the war at the end of 2023.According to the data , the number of female draftee seeking combat position in the shadow of the war broke every pre-war set goal.Regarding female draftee & rsquo ; participation , border patrol unit were at 116 % ; battle-related intelligence collection wa at 133 % ; artillery wa at 132 % ; air defense wa at 101 % ; rescue unit were at 122 % ; and border police wa at 119 % .

Hanegbi and Dermer , the latter in particular , are the prime minister & rsquo ; s people . US official acknowledge that with this decision to call off the trip , Netanyahu wa & ldquo ; putting his foot down , & rdquo ; feeling increasing heat personally from the administration over how he is running Israel & rsquo ; s affair . & ldquo ; Minister Benny Gantz wa here earlier this month , Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is here now , [ and ] the defense establishment are in constant contact , & rdquo ; a White House aide argued . & ldquo ; Calling off the Hanegbi-Dermer delegation is political window dressing by the prime minister . & rdquo ; In response to the question of whether the administration wa also acting politically & ndash ; by supporting Israel but looking over it shoulder amid the president & rsquo ; s re-election campaign to make sure it didn & rsquo ; t alienate it electorate too much & ndash ; a White House aide insisted : & ldquo ; Israel ha no better friend than the Biden administration , in general & ndash ; and regarding Gaza , in particular . & rdquo ; On the one hand , the aide seemed to be charging that Netanyahu wa not sufficiently appreciating the administration & rsquo ; s obstacle course in navigating it policy regarding Gaza , and that calling off the visit to Washington by his delegation only exacerbated the public impression & ldquo ; that the two country are not on the same side . & rdquo ; On the other hand , the aide reiterated that & ldquo ; on the ground , our cooperation is not affected . & rdquo ; Biden on Netanyahu 's governance & nbsp ; In a recent MSNBC interview , President Joe Biden charged that Netanyahu wa doing more harm than good ; he ha also publicly questioned Israel & rsquo ; s plan for a Rafah operation .

Some aide seem to hint that having Harris playing & ldquo ; bad cop & rdquo ; with some of her declaration on Israel allows Biden to hope he can placate those who say they would vote for him in November , but are threatening not to do so over what some even call his support for & ldquo ; genocide . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; Listen , the [ UN ] Security Council called for a ceasefire , but it also called for a release of the hostage , & rdquo ; argued a Biden aide . & ldquo ; We have not abandoned Israel , [ and ] we have not abandoned the Israeli mission in Gaza . We have also not abandoned the need for humanitarian aid and working toward the overall well-being of Palestinians in Gaza.Cooperation is key - but difficult in attaining & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The question is what is the best way to achieve all these goal ; it is challenging , & rdquo ; the aide said . & ldquo ; We want to work with the Israelis .

2022-03-10 16:18:35.127,jpost,"& ldquo ; Nineteen arrested in large brawl at Soroka hospital in Beersheba , & rdquo ; a headline read in November . A fight broke out between two Bedouin family from Rahat , about 20 km . north of Beersheba . The reason it made the news wa the location & ndash ; brawl happen all the time . There are thousand of Bedouin living in the Negev ; their story must extend deeper than crime-ridden headline . So , who are the Bedouin of the South ? The clash took place in one of the parking lot at Soroka-University Medical Center in Beersheba , with two people being injured . By the end of a long night , which included gunshot and stone-throwing , 19 people were arrested . Beersheba Deputy Mayor Shimon Tuval said at the time that the situation wa madness . & ldquo ; Not only did we lose Beersheba , we lost the whole country . Shots in a hospital are a redline that can not be crossed . & rdquo ; Hospitals are not a place for incident like these and are not equipped to deal with them , Dr . Shlomi Kodesh , director of Soroka , said at the time . The Beersheba Municipality did not respond to a request for comment for this article . Soroka When the incident in Soroka occurred , it wa in the context of a string of attack happening inside or near hospital space , which are supposed to be safe and immune . Dr . Zeev Feldman , chairman of the Association of Public Health Doctors in Israel and acting chairman of the Israeli Medical Association , explained to The Jerusalem Post at the time that hospital are merely a microcosm of society . & lsquo ; Lawlessness & rsquo ; in the Negev The lack of governance in the Negev is an ongoing issue , and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said at the time : & ldquo ; We are dealing in an orderly manner with problem that we have already become accustomed to having nothing to do with , that are chronic problem that are used to being pushed off . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; If the State of Israel doe not protect the land on which it stand , it will cease to exist , & rdquo ; Naomi Linder Kahn , director of the International Division at Regavim , told the Magazine . Regavim is an NGO that describes itself a & ldquo ; committed to protecting Israel & rsquo ; s land resource . & rdquo ; Land , Kahn explained , is the most basic resource of a state . And the organization , in the 16 year since it founding , ha found that Israel fails to protect it in the Negev . According to Regavim , lawlessness lead to abuse in land use , which is significant because the Negev comprises more than 60 % of the landmass of Israel . & ldquo ; The land is being chewed up at an incredibly alarming rate by illegal Bedouin construction , & rdquo ; Kahn said . Regavim warned that & ldquo ; if we continue on the trajectory we are on right now , we will lose the Negev . & rdquo ; A story within a story & ldquo ; There & rsquo ; s an entire culture here : Towns , settlement , MKs and even the police play a small part in this story , & rdquo ; Israel Police said . & ldquo ; Police [ play the part of dealing with the ] criminal story , but the story here in the Negev is about culture . Everyone who life in the South engages with this dialogue every day . & ldquo ; To understand what the Bedouin do , you need to understand their culture . Police are a tiny part in this giant story of Bedouin settlement in the Negev ; talking about [ how the ] police [ should intervene ] give good headline , but it is not the story . & rdquo ; In November , the Knesset & rsquo ; s Research and Information Center published a staggering report showing that the highest crime rate in the country are in the South . & ldquo ; Our worst fear is that the State of Israel created a state within a state . They don & rsquo ; t pay tax , they don & rsquo ; t have proper address ; people are living off the grid and are not accountable under the law , & rdquo ; said Kahn . On a tour in the area in December , Bennett proclaimed : & ldquo ; The law of Beersheba and Rahat is like the law of Tel Aviv . We will continue to act until we restore the sense of security to the resident of the South . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Bedouin community is on the lowest socioeconomic rung in Israel , Kahn said , with there being gap in education and in infrastructure . & ldquo ; These are thing they have a legal right to a citizen of Israel , but the money that the government invests in the Bedouin sector is getting lost along the way . & rdquo ; When Bennett went south , he met with Beersheba Mayor Ruvik Danilovich , who delivered a clear message : Stronger governance is needed in the Negev to begin to regulate Bedouin settlement . Danilovich wa one of the only town leader Bennett met with on his tour , catching flak for only going to an observation point that overlook Rahat and not entering the city itself . Faiz Abu Sahiban , mayor of the largest Bedouin city and the second-largest Arab city in Israel , called the trip an insult . & ldquo ; Rahat is a city well inside the border of Israel , not outside of it . The itinerary of the tour is problematic and disgusting in how it treat a city that is in the heart of the state a a threat . & rdquo ; What would happen if the state intervenes ? & ldquo ; [ We would have ] a completely protected minority that can live fully under the law and protect their own culture , & rdquo ; Regavim said . In Regavim & rsquo ; s eye , there are two step that are necessary to take to ensure stability in the region : Putting people on the map & ndash ; making sure that everyone is registered to a real address , for accountability and tracking & ndash ; and resolving land ownership dispute . In October , Bennett & rsquo ; s government wa threatened over a bill introduced by Ra & rsquo ; am ( United Arab List ) , later passing in the plenum a the electricity law . The law allows thousand of illegally built home to be hooked up to the national electricity grid . & ldquo ; The government woke up and realized that 300,000 Bedouin are living here [ without proper infrastructure ] and that this is a ticking time bomb . So , the government started to change it tune , & rdquo ; the police said . Beersheba is the fastest growing city in Israel , but it can & rsquo ; t grow because of the illegal encampment surrounding it . If that is the case , & ldquo ; we & rsquo ; re finished , & rdquo ; Regavim & rsquo ; s Kahn said . According to the Israel Police , a solution could be found by taking the right approach in the dispute between the two culture & ndash ; Western-Israeli and Bedouin . & ldquo ; Anyone who try to understand the Bedouin culture with Western eye will fail , & rdquo ; it said . ■",israel 's bedouin : what is the truth behind the crime-ridden headline ?

The meeting wa scheduled to take place in Ramallah on Sunday evening.Palestinian official said that the PA leadership wa called to discus the implementation of a resolution by the Palestinian Central Council ( PCC ) to terminate all signed agreement with Israel , halt security coordination and suspend PLO recognition of Israel until the Israeli government recognizes a Palestinian state on the pre-1967 line , with east Jerusalem a it capital.The resolution wa announced by the PCC in 2018 and again earlier this year during a meeting in Ramallah.Since the beginning of the tension , Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , who is based in Doha , Qatar , ha been holding a series of contact with Egypt , Qatar , the United Nations and other party on way of averting an all-out confrontation with Israel.Haniyeh wa in touch with senior Egyptian intelligence official , Qatari ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and his foreign minister , and the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland.The Hamas leader also contacted Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Oman & rsquo ; s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi.On Saturday , report surfaced in a number of Arab medium outlet concerning a truce agreement that ha been reached between the Gaza-based terrorist group and Israel.The report created the impression that Abbas and the PA were no longer seen a relevant and influential player . In addition , the report implied that the Hamas leadership wa the only address for restoring calm.Following the news about the truce deal , the PA leadership issued a statement in which it said that Abbas and the Palestinian leadership & ldquo ; continue their action at the international level , including sending message and making contact with a number of world leader and international organization . & rdquo ; According to the statement , & ldquo ; These contact aim to brief world leader and international organization on the dangerous situation that the Palestinian territory are going through , including incursion into city , camp and village , especially what is happening in Jerusalem . & rdquo ; The statement wa clearly intended to show that Abbas and the PA leadership were not sitting on the fence while several country and party were negotiating with Hamas.A PA official insisted on Monday that the Ramallah-based leadership wa & ldquo ; directly involved & rdquo ; in all the contact with international party over the past few day . & ldquo ; The Egyptians and Qataris know that the Palestinian leadership is the only address , & rdquo ; the official told The Jerusalem Post . & ldquo ; Any attempt to sideline President Abbas and the legitimate leadership of the Palestinian people won & rsquo ; t succeed . & rdquo ; The official pointed out that Abbas and Jordan & rsquo ; s King Abdullah discussed the latest development in the Palestinian arena during a phone conversation on Monday.Abbas also held similar discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin , the emir of Qatar and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , he said.But a Fatah official told the Hamas-affiliated Shehab news website that Abbas & rsquo ; s insistence on maintaining tight and exclusive control of the decision-making process ha created a crisis in the PA.The official claimed that Abbas wa only consulting with his confidant , senior PLO and Fatah official Hussein al-Sheikh , a well a the commander of the PA security forces.The unnamed official also said that Abbas wa outraged with the Arab and foreign mediator for ignoring him and talking directly to Hamas.Abbas & rsquo ; s decision to call off the planned meeting of the Palestinian leadership raised eyebrow and drew sharp criticism from many Palestinians .

We struggled for four year because we thought we might be able to bring change , but we were deceived . & ldquo ; The 13 young people killed from the Ethiopian community were not killed by the brutal Hamas , but by our people , by policeman whom we finance with our money .

2024-04-27 05:35:53.523,jpost,"The Eurovision 2024 slogan is & ldquo ; United by Music , & rdquo ; but Israeli Eurovision fan fear that the true slogan this year may be & ldquo ; United by Hate and Antisemitism . & rdquo ; It wa never going to be easy for Eden Golan , Israel & rsquo ; s contestant , to compete in Eurovision in 2024 during the war with Hamas , but the fact that the international song contest will be held this year in Malmo , Sweden , considered to be one of the most antisemitic city in the world , ha made it infinitely more complicated and dangerous for Israel to take part . & nbsp ; The war would have affected Israel & rsquo ; s participation in any city , but last year , when Sweden & rsquo ; s Loreen won the competition with her song , & ldquo ; Tattoo , & rdquo ; it guaranteed that the competition would move to Malmo , since the contest is held in the home country of the previous year & rsquo ; s winner . & nbsp ; A city known for antisemitic threat and harassmentMalmo , Sweden & rsquo ; s third largest city , is a port city connected by the Oresund Bridge to Copenhagen , but it location , unfortunately doe not ensure that it is cosmopolitan or tolerant . Malmo ha a population of a little over 350,000 and there are about 100,000 Muslims in the region . In recent year , the small Jewish community in the city ha reported serious antisemitic threat and harassment from Malmo & rsquo ; s Muslim residents.Israeli Eurovision contestant have always performed under heavy security , but according to multiple medium report , security measure have been heightened greatly in advance of this year & rsquo ; s contest , which will open on May 7 . & nbsp ; Golan is set to perform in the semi-final on May 9 . She and the entire Israeli delegation & ndash ; consisting of her dancer , musician , stylist , and others & ndash ; is said to have been told by the Shin Bet , Israel & rsquo ; s security service , to stay in their Malmo hotel room at all time , except when Golan is actually performing . & nbsp ; While Israelis have always needed security , past Israeli delegation to Eurovision contest have had at least some opportunity to mingle with the other delegation and enjoy the city in which the contest ha been held , an important part of participating in an international competition . But this year , the focus will be on keeping them safe to the exclusion of everything else in the wake of anti-war protest and threats.A recent report by Keshet 12 News correspondent Ohad Hemo and Elad Simchayoff on Malmo revealed a disturbing level of antisemitism among the Muslim population of the city . The reporter and their crew were threatened , assaulted , and spit on many time by Muslim resident of Malmo who heard them speaking Hebrew . Being filmed did not deter these harasser . & nbsp ; One Jewish resident of an upscale Malmo neighborhood told the Keshet correspondent that she wa alerted to the Hamas attack on the morning of October 7 by hearing cheer from the street that were so loud that they woke her . Yair Elsner , also a Jewish Malmo resident , told them that in the first week after October 7 , he would walk from his building to his car carrying a knife to protect himself . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; You go outside and you see exactly the same people who did October 7 , but here . There is no difference & ndash ; there is no reason to assume that they wouldn & rsquo ; t be able to commit the same atrocity on u here if only they could , & rdquo ; he told them . & nbsp ; Keshet reported that seven out of 10 Swedish Jews testified in a recent survey that their life had become more difficult following October 7 and about half of them said they had considered or were considering leaving the country.Perhaps the most chilling aspect of their report wa that guard at a Malmo mosque , who did not realize that the Keshet correspondent were Jewish , told them that they had heard there would be a bomb attack at Eurovision and that everyone they knew wa going to stay away from Malmo Arena , where the contest will take place . & nbsp ; UNFORTUNATELY , antisemitism in Malmo is nothing new . Fourteen year ago , the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel warning for Jews to southern Sweden and especially to Malmo . In 2015 , a Swedish journalist walked around the city wearing a kippah and a Star of David had to stop filming earlier than planned because so many people threatened him , cursed him , and threw egg at him . & nbsp ; In 2016 , Danish Jewish actor Kim Bodnia quit the hit detective series , The Bridge , which wa filmed in Malmo and Copenhagen , saying in an interview , & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not very comfortable to be [ in Malmo ] a a Jewish person . & rdquo ; It isn & rsquo ; t only antisemitism that is on the rise in Sweden , but lawlessness in general . According to report , in 2022 , in Stockholm , the number of gun murder wa 30 time higher than that of London . & ldquo ; These are difficult time for Sweden , & rdquo ; Olaf Kristersson , the prime minister said . & ldquo ; Sweden ha never seen anything like this before & ndash ; no other country in Europe ha seen anything like this . & rdquo ; While Sweden may have the reputation of being a clean , prosperous country with great social service such a health care and a high standard of living , in recent year , it ha been coping with an epidemic of drug gang violence that includes bomb and grenade attack . & nbsp ; In an article headlined , & ldquo ; Sweden & rsquo ; s new normal : Bombs in the suburb on a weeknight & rdquo ; in Politico , Charles Duxbury wrote in early October 2023 : & ldquo ; The upswell of [ gang ] violence ha been so intense , widespread , and chaotically executed & ndash ; inexperienced teenage boy are often recruited to carry out the attack & ndash ; that there is a growing sense here that no one is safe from it . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; According to The Guardian , in 2023 there were 149 successful bomb detonation and 62 attempted bombing in Sweden , in a country with a total population of about 10.5 million people . & nbsp ; THE LAWLESSNESS and antisemitism have combined to give Israeli security the challenge of a lifetime , while the delegation will also have to cope with hostility from other Eurovision contestant . Some artist have called for Israel to be banned from Eurovision , a Russia wa following it invasion of Ukraine , but the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) , which run Eurovision , ha reiterated it stance that it is a contest for broadcaster , not government , and that Israel & rsquo ; s Kan broadcaster ha done nothing wrong . & nbsp ; Yet , despite the threat level , Eden Golan & rsquo ; s song , & ldquo ; Hurricane & rdquo ; ha consistently been in the top 10 in the Eurovision betting table , considered a reliable measure of success in the contest ; at presstime , & ldquo ; Hurricane & rdquo ; wa in the seventh spot out of 37 country . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s original choice for it song , & ldquo ; October Rain , & rdquo ; wa rejected by the EBU . Eurovision & rsquo ; s policy is that song should avoid specific political content and the song wa seen a a comment on the Hamas massacre , which it unquestionably wa . & nbsp ; The new song , & ldquo ; Hurricane , & rdquo ; made the lyric vaguer , although the sentiment expressed is essentially the same . The music video released for the song show Golan singing at a location that look much like the Supernova music festival , where about 10 % of the attendee were murdered and taken hostage on October 7 , with dancer seemingly writhing in agony . & nbsp ; Israel began taking part in Eurovision in 1973 , even though it is not in Europe , since it would not have been welcomed in a Middle Eastern regional song contest . It took home the top prize in 1978 and 1979 with win for Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta for the song & ldquo ; A-Ba-Ni-Bi , & rdquo ; and Milk and Honey for & ldquo ; Hallelujah , & rdquo ; respectively , and again in 1998 with International & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; Diva . & rdquo ; In 2018 , Netta Barzilai became Israel & rsquo ; s fourth Eurovision winner with her rousing rendition of & ldquo ; Toy , & rdquo ; and in 2023 , pop star Noa Kirel came in third with her high-energy song , & ldquo ; Unicorn . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Golan , the 20-year-old Israeli singer who spent much of her childhood in Russia , where she had a successful singing career , ha shown great poise and determination in the face of the threat and hostility . & nbsp ; She told Eurovision Fun earlier this week that she had complete trust in her security detail and wa excited to compete . & ldquo ; This is my dream coming true . Represent my country and do something big in front of the whole world ! & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; This year it take on a different and greater meaning , to stand there on stage and show that we are here .

If Hamas is not taken care of , there will literally be no place to go in the country , & rdquo ; according to Israel Defense Forces spokesman Maj . Doron Spielman.Spielman spoke to The Jerusalem Post from Kibbutz Be & rsquo ; eri in southern Israel , where over 100 of the community & rsquo ; s approximately 1,000 resident were slaughtered on October 7 . Israeli strike targeting Hamas interrupted the conversation frequently with loud booms.Israel ha been conducting airstrikes against Hamas for the past two week . The IDF and the Prime Minister & rsquo ; s Office have discussed the possibility of an imminent ground offensive to cripple Hamas & rsquo ; s capacity to function a a government or a a terrorist organization.The last time Israel entered Gaza wa in 2014 in Operation Protective Edge , 67 soldier were killed . Following the recent attack that claimed more than 1,400 life , Spielman acknowledged the reluctance to consider further casualty in a war against Hamas . Nevertheless , he belief that the people of Israel will support such action . & ldquo ; This is not Vietnam , 4,000 mile away . The enemy is two mile away , & rdquo ; Spielman said . & ldquo ; The son or daughter who enter Gaza will be fighting for their home , literally , behind them . The citizen will stand behind u until the job is done . & rdquo ; He said , & ldquo ; I think it is going to be very difficult and could be very painful . Not taking action could be more painful . & rdquo ; However , the IDF and Israel & rsquo ; s intelligence community could not prevent the Hamas massacre . In some instance , such a in Kibbutz Be & rsquo ; eri , it took troop more than eight hour to arrive to engage the terrorist . This ha raised question whether the country can effectively rely on the IDF to deal with Hamas.Spielman said the troop were caught off guard on October 7 . Yet , & ldquo ; when they did show up , they did an excellent job . & rdquo ; He said , & ldquo ; I think the difference now is that we know our exact mission . Our troop have been incredibly trained . Even before this and now , they & rsquo ; ve been training in urban warfare setting . & rdquo ; To dismantle Hamas , the IDF need to go to themIf Israel want to dismantle Hamas , he said , the country ha to go where the terrorist are.What is the mission ? & ldquo ; To completely dismantle Hamas , both on a governance level and on the military level , & rdquo ; said Spielman . & ldquo ; The idea is that Hamas can not just pop up again . It & rsquo ; s the idea that you & rsquo ; re rooting out Hamas . You & rsquo ; re pulling the root out of the ground so that they can no longer have a life force . & ldquo ; This is a very complicated , long-term mission that our soldier are ready for . & rdquo ;","' nowhere in israel is safe ' due to hamas , say idf spokesman"

2023-11-19 05:44:18.283,jpost,"Cruelty , suspicion , and complete indifference to the suffering of his family and his people & mdash ; these are some of the quality that are revealed when reading the testimony of Yahya Sinwar , the leader of Hamas in Gaza , from his day a a young and particularly dangerous operative in the rank of the terrorist organization.The quality cited here were referenced by Sinwar during a recently revealed police interrogation in 1989 . His quote give a glimpse into the dark personality of the master terrorist , who did not hesitate to harm his people or anyone he considered to be an apostate from the religion of Islam or a collaborator with Israel.A chilling illustration of this can be found in the testimony concerning the murder committed by Sinwar & mdash ; of a collaborator with Israel named Rami Salim . `` I strangled him with a kaffiyeh '' In order to get the `` authorization `` to kill Salim , Sinwar turned to the leader of Hamas , Sheikh Ahmed Yassin . Salim wa subjected to a violent interrogation at the hand of Sinwar , and confessed to having tie with the Israeli security force a well a violating religious principles.In his investigation , Sinwar described Salim 's execution : `` On the way I blindfolded him with a rag , so that he would n't see where we were going . At the cemetery I put Rasmi into the big grave . . . and there I strangled Rasmi with a kaffiyeh I had . Then I suffocated him , wrapped him in a white cloth , in a shroud , and then I went out and closed the grave . `` The same wa true of another person , named Adnan Azfur , whom Sinwar also suspected of having connection with Israel . `` We interrogated Adnan , beat him and talked to him , and then he admitted that he wa connected with the Israeli intelligence . . . then we decided to kill him . . . and there I strangled Adnan by force , and I . . . dug in the place , and we buried him there , and we each went to our home . `` In his statement to the police , Sinwar described how the information reached him : `` We received information about one Fathi Issa , from the al-Birij refugee camp , who wa cooperating with the authority . `` Sinwar followed him , kidnapped him , and brought him to an orchard for an ' interrogation ' . ' I stayed with Fakhri and started questioning him . I grabbed his throat with one hand and started choking him , and with the other hand I punched him in the stomach , then suddenly he had a heart attack and died , `` Sinwar told his investigators.Another person who did not escape Sinwar 's clutch wa a man named Hossein al-Sir Mahan Yun . This is how Sinwar described his exploit to the police : `` While they were threatening Hossein al-Sir , a he started to get out of the car and started to resist , I pressed the gun to his neck so that he would get into our car . Then a bullet wa fired from my gun and hit him . `` Sinwar tested bomb & mdash ; on Al-Shifa HospitalAnother example of the indifference of the Hamas leader in Gaza to the life of his people can be found in the following story : In 1987 , Sinwar wanted to experiment with dropping explosive charge . Of all place , he chose Shifa Hospital in Gaza City a a dummy target , which ha since become a symbol of Hamas 's cynicism and the willingness of it and it leader & mdash ; who according to report are or at least were hiding under the hospital & mdash ; to use the civilian population a a human shield . The explosive device did explode.The quote that appear here are taken from a High Court decision that rejected the request of Sinwar 's father , Ibrahim Hassan Sinwar , that his house not be destroyed due to his son 's criminal act . The retired president of the Supreme Court , Meir Shamgar , rejected the petition with the following prophetic word : `` The severity of Yahya 's action , described above , who strangled to death , with his own hand , people suspected of cooperating with the authority , is the background to the decision of the respondent , who considered and believed that in this case the adoption of punitive measure is required . There is no reason to deny the reasonableness of this step . `` Indeed , the member of Yahya 's family are also now suffering because of his action , `` Shamgar wrote , `` but this is indeed , more than once , the side effect of any punishment ( such a imprisonment or even a fine ) , which is indeed imposed on the accused , but which hurt & mdash ; no less and sometimes even more & mdash ; those who depend on him . This alone can not be used to negate the justification of an act of deterrent punishment , which appears to the respondent to be essential in order to fulfill his duty and responsibility . The petition is dismissed . ``","yahya sinwar 's 1989 interrogation reveals hamas leader 's cruelty , ruthlessness"

It is not a small matter that the demonstrator in Jerusalem and , according to video also in Umm Al-Fahm , celebrated the rocket fire from Gaza .

2024-05-10 18:22:39.880,jpost,"As swiftly a a hurricane , Israel & rsquo ; s Eurovision contestant , Eden Golan , shot up the betting table from eighth place to the number two spot following her performance in the second semi-final at the 68th Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo , Sweden on Thursday night , in which she secured a place in the Grand Final , which will take place on Saturday.Although there were protest outside the arena and the 20-year-old Golan wa booed by a she sang & ldquo ; Hurricane , & rdquo ; she also received thunderous applause , winning heart around the world with her grace under pressure . Voters around the world enjoyed her performance enough to put her into the final . The result of each country & rsquo ; s vote is meant to be secret , but RAI , the Italian broadcaster , briefly showed the detailed breakdown on screen which revealed that Golan had won 39.3 % of it country & rsquo ; s votes.RAI ha since said that the result it released were `` incomplete . `` And here is a graphic of the televoting odds , showing Israel in first place : http : / / eurovisionworld.com/odds/eurovision-teleWhether she will do a well in the Grand Final , in which the result will be determined by national jury from the participating country a well a by fan from around the world , remains to be seen . Israel is now predicted to win the televote , with the oddsmakers giving Golan a 43 % chance of a televote win . But she is predicted to come in fifth in the jury vote , which will mean that she will ultimately finish second to the favorite , Croatia 's Baby Lasagna with the high-energy song , `` Rim Tim Tagi Dim . `` & nbsp ; But her performance Thursday and the resulting score were a triumph for Golan and for Israel . Each shout from the crowd seemed only to enhance the preternaturally poised Golan & rsquo ; s performance , a she hit every note and dance move perfectly.Far more experienced performer might have cracked under the kind of pressure and distraction that Golan faced , but she tuned them out and did her best work to date . `` I did n't hear the boo , `` she said in a press conference following the semi-final . `` I wa completely focused . I felt no apprehension and no fear . `` Sometimes a song is just a song and Eurovision is just a fun song contest that Israel tends to do well in , which it ha won four time in the past.But not this year.Israel 's journey through Eurovision conflictAt first , it wasn & rsquo ; t even clear that Israel would send a contestant because of the war that started following the Hamas massacre in Israel on October 7 . It wa decided that the best choice would be to participate , but to use the song and the platform to acknowledge the tragedy.The shadow of the war hovered over the Next Star for Eurovision contest , a Shaul Greenglick , who appeared in early December , wa killed in the fighting in the Gaza Strip . Greenglick , 26 , from Ra & rsquo ; anana , an officer in the Nahal Brigade & rsquo ; s 931st Battalion , wore his uniform to perform and sang the song & ldquo ; Blind Bat & rdquo ; by Hanan Ben Ari . The judge were enthusiastic about his performance , and he would have advanced to the next round.Golan , a polished and experienced performer , who wa a child star in Russia , where she spent much of her childhood due to her father & rsquo ; s work , won the contest and Israeli Eurovision fan rejoiced . But even while Israelis were pleased with Golan , there were difficulty over the first song chosen by Israel , & ldquo ; October Rain , & rdquo ; because it contained reference to the massacre , which the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) , sponsor of the contest , found too overtly political . It wa eventually replaced by & ldquo ; Hurricane , & rdquo ; which contains softer lyric , but still seems to refer to recent events.The music video released with the song seemed to show Golan and dancer in a field like where the Supernova Music Festival , where almost 400 concertgoers and staff were killed on October 7 and another 400 were kidnapped , took place.The song by Avi Ohayon , Keren Peles , and Stav Berger , contains these lyric in English , & ldquo ; Every day , I 'm losin ' my mind . . . Dancin & rsquo ; in the storm/I got nothing to hide/Take it all and leave the world behind/Baby promise me you & rsquo ; ll hold me again/I & rsquo ; m still broken from this hurricane , & rdquo ; with additional lyric in Hebrew : & ldquo ; We don & rsquo ; t need big word , just prayers/Even if it & rsquo ; s hard to see/You always leave me one little light . & rdquo ; The costume are sand-colored strip of cloth , very different from the usual body-baring , flashy Eurovision look , and were designed by Alon Livne and styled by Itay Bezaleli , that look like torn clothes or bandage and the dancer moved in a loose-limbed but focused way that wa reminiscent of Batsheva choreographer Ohad Naharin & rsquo ; s Gaga technique.It isn & rsquo ; t a stretch to see the song a the word of a young woman who ha lost the love of her life in the massacre looking back and honoring his memory.But it wasn & rsquo ; t only Israel & rsquo ; s song choice that raised the stake this year . Thousands of artist , mainly from Ireland and Scandinavia , called for Israel to be banned and for artist to boycott the event , although none did.Malmo ha a large Muslim population much of which , according to medium report , are particularly hostile to Israel . The Israeli government issued travel warning for Israelis attending to the event and the head of the Shin Bet security agency , Ronen Bar , went to Malmo to personally supervise Golan & rsquo ; s security . Golan and her entourage were advised to stay in their hotel room at all time when not performing.On Thursday , protester including climate activist Greta Thunberg demonstrated near the arena , accusing Israel of committing genocide and being an apartheid state . Not many people outside Sweden know that Thunberg & rsquo ; s mother , Malena Ernman , is a professional singer who represented Sweden in Eurovision in 2009 , finishing in 21st place.That wa the year that Israel sent Noa and Mira Awad , a Jew and a Christian Arab , to compete . The duo finished in 16th place with their song , & ldquo ; There Must Be Another Way , & rdquo ; which celebrates coexistence , although if her mother ever told her about that , Thunberg seemed to have forgotten on Thursday.Golan and the Israeli delegation had security like a head of state , with a motorcade comprised of dozen of car accompanying her from her hotel to the venue . But Golan said in numerous interview that she had felt only & ldquo ; good vibe & rdquo ; from her fellow contestant , although there were sign that not everyone wa so accepting of her presence.During a press conference after she advanced to the final , a Polish journalist asked Golan , & ldquo ; Have you ever thought that by being here , you bring risk and danger for other participant ? & rdquo ; Told she did n't have to answer the question , Golan responded , nonetheless , & ldquo ; I think we & rsquo ; re all here for one reason , and one reason only . And the EBU is taking all safety precaution to make this a safe and united place for everyone , so I think it & rsquo ; s safe for everyone . & rdquo ; Rylan Clark , one of the BBC host of Eurovision coverage , ha been doing interview with contestant that he post on TikTok , but he didn & rsquo ; t interview Golan in person , which won him praise from some , while others pointed out he did not personally interview every performer.Belgium 's representative , Mustii , had the word `` peace `` written on his arm during his performance at the semi-final . The Flemish Broadcasting Authority in Belgium opened the Eurovision broadcast on Thursday night with a protest slide against Israel that said , `` We condemn Israel 's violation of human right , which also harm the freedom of the press . Ceasefire now . `` The Finnish singer , Kaarija , who represented his country last year with the catchy , & ldquo ; Cha Cha Cha , & rdquo ; danced with Golan backstage a camera rolled . The video wa posted to social medium by KAN , which sponsor and broadcast Eurovision in Israel , and other place , but he later posted a disclaimer to Instagram that said , `` I happened to meet Israel 's Eurovision representative today , and a video wa filmed of u . It wa then posted on social medium without my permission . Despite my request for it removal , it ha not been taken down . I would like to clarify and emphasize that the video is not a political statement or an endorsement of any kind . `` Swedish singer Eric Saade performed in the opening of the first semi final with a keffiya wrapped around his hand , although political symbol are banned .

In his statement , Netanyahu said , `` Eden , I want to wish you success , but you have already succeeded .

2020-12-31 18:38:35.657,jpost,"Two of Israel & rsquo ; s top international law official have published a rare public article to challenge the International Criminal Court prosecution and others who say that Israel still illegally occupies Gaza . The article , published in the journal Iyunei Mishpat ( Legal Studies ) recently but being reported now for the first time in English , is important both regarding addressing case of alleged Israeli war crime in ongoing fighting with Hamas , a well a regarding what humanitarian obligation Jerusalem ha to Gaza , during coronavirus and other period . These issue ultimately have major long-term implication at the national security and diplomatic level , including whether Israel & rsquo ; s naval blockade and other periodic closure of Gaza are legal . Just a important are the author : Deputy Attorney-General ( International Law ) Roy Schondorf and IDF International Law Division chief Col . Eran Shamir-Borer , two official who have led much of Israel & rsquo ; s handling of ICC issue and humanitarian dilemma with Gaza . Schondorf rarely writes publicly or appears in public with the exception of specific conference or at the Knesset , and Shamir-Borer appears even less often . It seems that the impetus for their article wa to address prior statement by ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda a well a a current article by prominent Israeli prof . Eyal Gross in the same journal , declaring that Israel still legally occupies Gaza , despite having withdrawn in 2005 . If Bensouda , Gross and a number of Israeli critic in UN and international body are correct that Israel occupies Gaza , it could mean that the Jewish state might be restricted in what category of force it could use to combat Hamas attack , let alone protest or riot on the border . Further , it could mean that any humanitarian crisis in Gaza put Israel at fault . When there are debate about Israeli blockade to prevent rocket and other weapon smuggling , these legal question could have a decisive impact . Essentially , Bensouda , Gross and much of the international community say that it is irrelevant that the IDF withdrew and that Israel withdrew it settlement from within the Gaza Strip . Rather , they argue that UN General Assembly decision , International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) guidance , a decision by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) and other point prove that Israel can & ldquo ; occupy & rdquo ; Gaza a long a it exerts functional control . To support their argument , they note that Israel control Gaza & rsquo ; s airspace , maritime border , wherever there is a blockade , and most of it land border . Gaza doe have one border crossing with Egypt . They broaden these argument by saying that Israel & rsquo ; s ability to control Gaza & rsquo ; s interaction with the outside world mean it can also control the economic and humanitarian situation there . In this light , they say that Israel is also obligated to maintain Gaza from a humanitarian perspective , whether with special need during coronavirus time or with sufficient medical , food , utility and other item during more normal period . IN CONTRAST , Schondorf and Shamir-Bohrer say that there is no basis to rely on the decision of the UN General Assembly or other political body to decide international law . Regarding the ICTY decision , they say that critic & rsquo ; understanding of the decision is misplaced . In the ICTY case in question , the court wa dealing with a situation where a foreign state controlled an internal group within another state in order to impose it will on the other state . In any event , the Israeli official & rsquo ; article say that the ICTY decision wa an outlier creating a new doctrine which no one else ha adopted . Moreover , the article say that the idea Israeli critic are bringing to the Gaza question are & ldquo ; wishful thinking & rdquo ; or & ldquo ; aspiration & rdquo ; to create a new law which doe not exist . Instead , they say that to be considered an & ldquo ; occupier , & rdquo ; a country can not merely have aspect of functional power over a territory . Rather , it must have at a minimum & ldquo ; effective control . & rdquo ; This traditionally ha required boot on the ground and , at the very least , involvement in running the day-to-day affair of the foreign territory and population . As the article say , Israel ha zero involvement in running Gaza & rsquo ; s day-to-day affair , which are run by Hamas . Further , the article cite a legal brief filed by Germany in the Israel-Palestinian proceeding before the ICC to support it view . All of this mean that Israel ha not occupied Gaza since 2005 . Rather , when Israel facilitates food , economic and medical aid to Gaza , it is on a voluntary humanitarian basis and balanced along with valid security consideration , say the article . In December 2019 , Bensouda requested that the ICC Pretrial Chamber endorse by March her desire to conduct a full criminal probe of Israel and Hamas regarding the 2014 Gaza War , the 2018 Gaza border crisis and the settlement enterprise . The chamber ha still not decided the issue , with the question remaining whether it will decide after US President-elect Joe Biden take office or wait for Bensouda & rsquo ; s successor to take over in June 2021 .",israel ’ s 2 top int ’ l law official take on icc : is gaza ‘ occupied ’ ?
2024-03-10 14:37:28.383,jpost,"Women have been present in the Israeli art scene from it beginning & ndash ; artist such a Aviva Uri , Esther Peretz Arad , Anna Ticho , Leah Nikel , and Ruth Shlos . Their role in building the art world in Israel seems to me a significant a the impact of female pioneer ( halutzot ) in creating the State of Israel , the role of the first female prime minister , Golda Meir , and ( up to the present day ) the importance of female soldier serving in the IDF.However , even though the role of woman ha been so crucial in Israel , and the feminist art movement wa not a strong a in other country , it took female artist decade to be equally represented by gallery and museums.Ruth Markus is a retired lecturer in Tel Aviv University & rsquo ; s History of Art Department and founder of the Association for Women & rsquo ; s Art and Gender Research in Israel . In her article & ldquo ; Artists : Yishuv and Israel : 1920-1970 & rdquo ; in the Shalvi/Hyman Encyclopedia of Jewish Women , she say that it is only since the 1990s that & ldquo ; the number of participant in exhibition in the various museum and gallery wa divided equally between men and woman , with the woman at time even in the majority . & rdquo ; Today , I even dare to say that woman dominate Israeli art . Therefore , especially on International Women & rsquo ; s Day , I & rsquo ; ve chosen for the Magazine three woman artist who , even during the war , are constantly active . They agreed to answer my three question : What inspires you ? What do you call art ? What , in your opinion , make your artwork different from that of other artist ? Batia ShaniBatia Shani is a multimedia artist , emphasizing embroidery , mail art , painting , and collage . She is the mother of three and grandmother of six.She us material and clothes previously used , including IDF uniform . Shani embroiders text , image , number , and amorphic shape . Each of the garment hold image and word ; for example , the name and age of woman murdered by their partner . Her art deal with social issue , violence against woman and family , people in crisis , refugee , and recently , the painful silence toward the sexual victim of the Oct . 7 massacre . In her latest work , it is embroidered : & ldquo ; Me too . Unless you & rsquo ; re a Jew . & rdquo ; Born and raised in Haifa to a family of Holocaust survivor who came to Israel just after WW II , Shani wa expected to get an education and start a & ldquo ; normal job . & rdquo ; So , before becoming an artist , she worked a a social worker . Art wa always present in her life , but it wa only in her mid-thirties that she decided to focus completely on art , studying at the Royal School of Needlework in London , and later in Israel at the Hamidrasha School of Art , Beit Berl College , Kalmania . & ldquo ; The study helped me understand that embroidery wa my language , & rdquo ; she said . Embroidery a a craft wa deeply rooted in her family tradition . When she wa a girl , she watched her aunt embroidering . She changed it into art.Since the 1990s , Shani ha exhibited her work at many art fair , gallery , and museum around the world . Now she is preparing two solo exhibition . & ldquo ; I Speak Gibberish to You & rdquo ; is set to open on May 9 in her studio at 6 Hapelech Street in Tel Aviv . A show at the University of Haifa ( name not yet revealed ) will open on June 2.INSPIRATION : Everything . In general , my work is improvised ; I don & rsquo ; t have any plan when I start my journey with my needle [ there is a dress full of story that she worked on for a year ] . My inspiration come from the piece of fabric that I started to work with , but it must be material with some history . In many of my work , I want to preserve the memory of my late mother.I am inspired by my emotion and by what I see around me . For example , in my upcoming exhibition , I will reflect on the situation in Israel . I felt a lack of word to express what wa happening in Israel [ last year ] , so I used embroidery a & lsquo ; gibberish & rsquo ; language . I thought it wa the worst moment in my country : I didn & rsquo ; t realize it could get much worse . . . MEANING OF ART : For me , a a viewer & ndash ; because I love seeing art by others & ndash ; it is something that touch me . Of course , it come through the door of visuality , but [ it ha to be ] something that will play on my emotional threads.SHANI & rsquo ; S ARTWORK : First of all , I refuse to look for something unique , something that is only mine . But , of course , it make me very happy when someone recognizes my embroidery and envelope & ndash ; which are also characteristic in my work ; these are my fingerprints.I think maybe the amount of sensitivity to the detail , maybe my ability to express sad and painful thing is what make my work different . I am a feminist artist , so I show thing that cause the discrimination of woman . I try not to put , a a headline , that my work is politically involved , but I have a lot to say about politics . I am dealing with catastrophe , with grief . The current war . . . The outcome is very aesthetic , often very colorful , but when people come closer to it , they notice the text that I embroidered , which is very hard.batiashani.com/Noa YekutieliAt a young age , Noa Yekutieli is already an internationally accomplished artist . For over a decade she ha had various solo show and participated in group exhibition all over the world . Her work are in the collection of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem , the Tel Aviv Museum of Art , and various private collection . She life and work in Tel Aviv , Los Angeles , and New York . Her solo exhibition & ldquo ; No Longer & ndash ; Not Yet & rdquo ; is currently on view at Brooklyn & rsquo ; s International Studio & amp ; Curatorial Program ( ISCP ) through June 21 . In April , she will participate in a group exhibition & ldquo ; Common Ground : Israeli Art Meets Archaeology & rdquo ; at the Israel Museum.Yekutieli come from a multicultural family ( Japanese-American-Israeli ) and us her rich heritage in her work . She combine a diversity of material that , she say , & ldquo ; echo longing for unknown singular origin and fractured notion of home . & rdquo ; She engages in various medium , such a installation , assemblage , and her signature manual paper-cutting technique , about which , she said , & ldquo ; It mirror my artistic essence . It embodies the Japanese concept of & lsquo ; Ma & rsquo ; & ndash ; emphasizing the significance of missing or what is missed . I am drawn to the unseen , reflecting overlooked narrative and the complexity of cultural assimilation . The act of it irreversibility reduction mirror life , leaving scar that prompt reflection . & rdquo ; INSPIRATION : As a multicultural artist of Japanese-American-Israeli background , I naturally seek to bridge between culture and language in my work . I am inspired to explore new language or form of expression to address traumatic and complex subject such a the social-political reality in Israel-Palestine , immigration , and cyclic pattern of destruction . & nbsp ; Through the medium of manual cut paper , I am compelled to create space and artwork imbued with a deliberately contrasting aesthetic . I attempt to offer an alternative language & ndash ; one that is more vulnerable , feminine , and nuanced & ndash ; in observing and reflecting on the harsh reality we confront . This counter the rapid pace and predominantly Western , masculine discourse that often created this reality , to begin with , and is perpetuating the continuous destructive pattern . I am inspired to create space that can hold more than one narrative , more than one absolute truth & ndash ; to question how we tell story rather than telling a story.MEANING OF ART : To me , art encompasses any endeavor that challenge what we often accept a & lsquo ; the nature of thing & rsquo ; or & lsquo ; established perspective . & rsquo ; It & rsquo ; s not about resistance for it own sake but rather about suggesting and providing fresh viewpoint to comprehend the reality surrounding u . Art act a a bubble within which I can uniquely unfold the intricacy of reality , and then reconnect with the broader world through my art again . It serf a a meditative space where my unconscious take over , leading me to different way of thinking about the given.YEKUTIELI & rsquo ; S ARTWORK : In my perspective , what set my artwork apart is that I am not afraid of embracing liminal space . Often , there & rsquo ; s a reluctance to engage with these space of in-betweenness : those that are almost , not here nor there , or unclear , even though they constitute much of our lived experience . In my practice , I am deeply intrigued by the notion of crafting environment where we collectively explore liminality , viewing it not a a mere interim state awaiting conclusion but a a novel and fertile terrain in it own right . & nbsp ; Coming from a multicultural background devoid of a historically shared past & ndash ; being both Japanese and Israeli & ndash ; I find myself naturally attuned to multiplicity without experiencing discomfort . In a world marked by polarization , I see the creation of space , where multiplicity enriches rather than confuses , a a crucial aspect of the human experience.www.noayekutieli.com/Ella TaubA self-taught artist , Ella Taub & ndash ; in her sculpture , painting , relief work , print , and drawing & ndash ; focus on the nature of change in a feminine body , also oscillating between historically appreciated shape and contemporary beauty image . Taub explores different female role in her art and the evolution of self-image.Taub work with different material , sometimes including body-like one , and metal chain . & ldquo ; I collect material for my work from my surroundings ; each of my work is connected to the place and time in which I create . Often , a material from which the sculpture emerges give the work & rsquo ; s narrative , & rdquo ; she told the Magazine.Some of her work are very personal and based on intimate relation with herself and others . In her recent February solo show in Tel Aviv & ldquo ; What I Didn & rsquo ; t Wear , & rdquo ; Taub refers to her close connection with her mother ( with whom , at age five , she made aliyah from St . Petersburg , Russia ) but also enters into a dialogue with her future daughter , whom she might have one day.Taub ha exhibited in Israel and Berlin . Her work are on view until March 9 at the group show & ldquo ; Bread and Roses 18 & rdquo ; at the Bread and Roses Gallery in Tel Aviv.INSPIRATION : My artistic journey is fueled by the intricate dance of relationship & ndash ; those between my inner self , my corporeal form , and the world around me . The allure lie in exploring the ever-shifting nuance of the feminine physique , it narrative etched by life & rsquo ; s twist and turn , and it resonance across diverse cultural landscape . Moreover , personal narrative , like the potent symbolism of freedom evoked by chain in select piece , serve a potent wellspring of inspiration . My art serf a a mirror reflecting the interplay of inner dialogue , societal construct , and the relentless quest for liberation.MEANING OF ART : Art , to me , is a boundless realm where creativity intertwines with introspection . It manifest in myriad form . Art is not merely about aesthetic ; it & rsquo ; s a profound exploration of complex theme , a challenge to established norm , and a conduit for stirring the soul . It & rsquo ; s a process that transcends boundary , beckoning viewer into a realm of dialogue , reflection , and interpretation.TAUB & rsquo ; S ARTWORK : My artistic voice resonates distinctly through it intimate exploration of the feminine form and it intricate relationship with the self-image perception and body expression society . Through solitary figure and intricate symbolism , I aim to evoke theme of independence , resilience , and the societal gaze upon woman & ndash ; and question historical patriarchal myth by infusion of personal narrative , and material , that are collected with a connection to the space and time . Ultimately , my art distinguishes itself through it poignant exploration of the human experience , beckoning viewer into a silent dialogue.ellataub.com / ","three woman artist , three question"
2024-05-01 18:25:55.633,jpost,"The world & rsquo ; s climate is changing & ndash ; again . But instead of getting warmer the last time like it is now , in around 6,200 BCE , it wa getting colder.A drought resulted and launched what wa called the 8.2ka ( kiloyears & ndash ; thousand of year & ndash ; ago ) , which began about 8,200 year ago and lasted for the next two to four century in the southern Levant that includes modern-day Israel , the Palestinian territory , Jordan , Lebanon , southern Syria and the Sinai desert.Until now , archaeologist thought that this sudden cooling in global climate led to the widespread abandonment of coastal settlement in the southern Levant . However , researcher at the University of Haifa , Bar-Ilan University ( BIU ) in Ramat Gan , and the University of California at San Diego have produced new evidence suggesting that at least one village formerly thought abandoned not only remained occupied but thrived throughout this period . They said the study helped fill a gap in our understanding of the early settlement of the Eastern Mediterranean coastline.They have just published their study in the journal Antiquity under the title & ldquo ; Continuity and climate change : the Neolithic coastal settlement of Habonim North , Israel . & rdquo ; The village of Habonim North wa discovered off the Carmel Coast in the mid-2010s and later surveyed by a team led by the University of Haifa & rsquo ; s Dr . Ehud Arkin Shalev . The study wa led by Prof . Assaf Yasur-Landau , head of the Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at the University of Haifa , and Roey Nickelsberg , a doctoral candidate there . BIU Prof . Ehud Weiss and Dr . Suembikya Frumin also participated . & ldquo ; This study helped fill a gap in our understanding of the early settlement of the Eastern Mediterranean coastline , & rdquo ; said Prof . Thomas Levy , a co-author on the paper , co-director of UC San Diego & rsquo ; s Center for Cyber-Archaeology and Sustainability ( CCAS ) and chairman of Archaeology of Ancient Israel and Neighboring Lands in the anthropology department of the university & rsquo ; s graduate division.Unearthing the Levantine coastline & ldquo ; It deal with human resilience , & rdquo ; he said . An experienced scuba diver , Levy spent 40 year carrying out archaeological field work in the desert of Israel and Jordan.Before it excavation and analysis , there wa little evidence for human habitation along the southern Levantine coast during the 8.2ka event . The dig , which involved a weeks-long , 24/7 coordinated effort between the partner in the two country , wa the first formal excavation of the submerged site.Animal bonesLED BY Yasur-Landau and Nickelsberg , the international team excavated the site using a combination of sediment dredging and sampling , a well a photogrammetry and 3D modeling . Team member uncovered pottery shard or & ldquo ; sherd & rdquo ; ; stone tool , including ceremonial weapon and fishing-net weight ; animal and plant remains ; and architecture.Using radiocarbon dating , the researcher tested the recovered bone of wild and domesticated animal , the charred seed of wild plant , crop like wheat and lentil , and weed that tend to accompany these crop . Their result traced these organic material back to the Early Pottery Neolithic ( EPN ) , which coincided with both the invention of pottery and the 8.2ka event.Pottery sherd , stone tool and architecture in the village were also evidence of activity at the site to the EPN and , surprisingly , to the Late Pottery Neolithic , when the village wa thought to have been abandoned.As for how the village likely weathered the worst of the climate instability , the researcher point to sign of an economy that diversified from farming to include maritime culture and trade within a distinct cultural identity . Evidence includes fishing-net weight ; tool made of basalt , a stone that doe not naturally occur along this part of the eastern Mediterranean coast ; and a ceremonial mace head . & ldquo ; Our study showed that the Early Pottery Neolithic society displayed multi-layered resilience that enabled it to withstand the 8.2ka crisis , & rdquo ; noted Yasur-Landau , a senior author on the paper . & ldquo ; I wa happily surprised by the richness of the find , from pottery to organic remains . & rdquo ; Although scientist debate the cause of the 8.2ka event , some speculate that it began with the final collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet , which shaped much of the North American landscape in it retreat from modern-day Canada and the northern US . As it melted , the ice sheet would have changed the flow of ocean current and affected heat transport , leading to the observed drop in global temperatures.Many of the activity uncovered at the village , including the creation of culturally distinct pottery and trade , formed the basis for later urban society . & ldquo ; To me , what & rsquo ; s important is to change how we look at thing , & rdquo ; said Nickelsberg . & ldquo ; Many archaeologist like to look at the collapse of civilization . Maybe it & rsquo ; s time to start looking at the development of human culture , rather than it destruction and abandonment .",joint us-israeli underwater excavation reveal ancient human resilience despite climate change
2021-09-17 13:20:27.683,jpost,"September 17 , 2021 mark 43 year since the signing of the Camp David Accords between former Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat , under the auspex of then US president Jimmy Carter . It paved the way for the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace deal , the first such treaty between Israel and one of it Arab neighbor . The Camp David Accords wa the culmination of considerable political machination and came just year after the conclusion of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 , widely regarded a Israel 's darkest hour and where Egypt played a major role a the aggressor . The war wa devastating , with the Jewish state flanked in a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria . Though Israel achieved a military victory over it adversary and came within shelling range of Damascus , the war shocked the Jewish state out of complacency , prompting the resignation of Israel 's prime minister Golda Meir . After the war Israelis viewed the Egyptian military in a new , more dangerous light . However , Egypt had seen the conflict differently . Despite Egyptian military success in the conflict , some in Cairo were convinced that Israel simply could not be beaten on the battlefield . As such , it seemed doubtful they could use force of arm to destroy the Jewish state . But one thing it undoubtedly achieved wa to shift the region 's status quo . & nbsp ; Two event then further changed everything and set the scene for the eventual peace talk . The first event wa on May 17 , 1977 . This wa Israel 's general election and saw the right-wing Likud Party , led by Begin , achieve a historic upset with a landslide victory , giving Israel a right-wing government for the first time ever . The second event wa Sadat 's historic interview on CBS News with Walter Cronkite on November 14 of the same year . During this interview , Sadat shocked the world by saying that he wa more than willing to actually visit Jerusalem for peace negotiation . & nbsp ; `` I want to discus the whole situation with the 120 member of the Knesset and put the full picture and detail of the situation from our point of view , `` he said at the time . & nbsp ; This wa not the first time Sadat expressed willingness to go to Israel , and he had said a much in a speech before the People 's Assembly just five day earlier . However , now his intention were made public to the world . That same day , Cronkite interviewed Begin and asked for his response . & ldquo ; I can assure you , Mr . Cronkite , a we really want the visit of president Sadat , we really want to negotiate the peace , to establish permanent peace in the Middle East , & rdquo ; Begin said . & ldquo ; Any time , any day he 's prepared to come , I will receive him cordially at the airport , and go together with him to Jerusalem , also present him to the Knesset and let him make his speech to our parliament . I will follow him onto the platform and greet him , receive him . & rdquo ; Shortly after , this exact situation happened . Sadat , in an unprecedented and historic moment , arrived at Lod Airport ( known today a Ben-Gurion Airport ) . On November 20 , Sadat then made history by addressing the Knesset . & nbsp ; Sadat 's move threw out the rulebook , taking Washington by surprise . It led to negotiation that culminated in the Camp David Accords , which were signed at the White House by Sadat and Begin in 1978 after 12 day of secret talk at Camp David . There were two framework in the accord . The first dealt with the Palestinians and faced condemnation for a lack of participation from the Palestinians themselves . However , the second framework wa between Egypt and Israel , winning both Begin and Sadat the Nobel Peace Prize and directly leading to the treaty being signed a year later . Notably , a part of the accord , Israel pledged to fully withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula in it entirety . Israel had taken the peninsula following the Six Day War , and Israeli settlement did exist in the area . But now they all had to be withdrawn . But ultimately , it wa seen a a good thing in Israel , where it continues to enjoy support . & nbsp ; According to a 2001 poll by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies , 85 % of Israelis support the accord . In Egypt , however , the response wa less positive . The nation of the Arab world were harshly critical of Egypt 's move , costing them their membership in the Arab League and causing unrest and sedition to fester , particularly among Islamist group . Ultimately , on October 6 , 1981 , Sadat wa assassinated at a victory parade by Islamists belonging to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization . In total , 11 people were killed at the event outright , including Sadat , an Omani delegate and the Cuban ambassador , while 28 were wounded . Sadat wa ultimately succeeded by his vice president , Hosni Mubarak , who stayed in power for 30 year until the 2011 Arab Spring . Today , Egypt 's relation with Israel are tense , particularly regarding the Palestinian conflict , and security remains strong at the Sinai border . However , Cairo ha maintained an active role in regional affair , particularly regarding the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip , with which it share a border . & nbsp ; Egypt played a critical role in the restoration of calm that ended the 11-day May war between Israel and Hamas , known a Operation Guardian of the Walls . Despite this , the peace remains cold , and following 2011 , Israeli and Egyptian leader went a decade without meeting , until Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met at Sharm e-Sheikh . Ultimately , the Camp David Accords are remembered positively a the first truly successful peace negotiation between Israel and an Arab nation .

Uri Gordin.According to Matthew Levitt , director of the Jeanette and Eli Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy , Hezbollah want to & ldquo ; scratch their resistance itch . & rdquo ; While Hezbollah can attempt to do something , it doe not want to drag the region into a full-blown war.Lebanon is in such a disastrous state that it understands the need for a maritime border deal , said Levitt , a former counter-terrorism official . But , he added , the group is also willing to put Lebanese citizen at risk and drag Israel into a war just to use it a a scapegoat.Hezbollah , Lebanon 's massive terrorist armyUnder Nasrallah , Hezbollah ha grown into what the IDF describes a a & ldquo ; terror army & rdquo ; with an estimated 150,000 rocket and munition that can hit anywhere in the country.It is believed that in the next war , Hezbollah will try to fire close to 4,000 rocket per day to start , followed by some 2,000 per day until the last day of the conflict.In comparison , during Operation Breaking Dawn in August , Islamic Jihad fired a total of just more than 1,000 rocket from Gaza in three days.In a recent interview with Walla , Gordin said the IDF will prioritize the northern part of the state , since 50 % of Hezbollah & rsquo ; s arsenal is aimed at city 15 km . from the border with Lebanon , including Nahariya , Acre , Safed and Kiryat Shmona.Another 40 % of Hezbollah & rsquo ; s missile can reach Haifa and surrounding area . Only 5 % can reach target further to the south.Hezbollah ha not given up on work on it precision munition project . It is believed that the majority of the alleged Israeli airstrikes in Syria a part of it & ldquo ; war between the war & rdquo ; campaign have been targeting component for the project.The terrorist group also ha sophisticated drone that can be used for reconnaissance mission or carry munition to attack targets.Though former Israel Air Force Commander Maj . - Gen ( re . ) Amikam Norkin ha said the IAF lost it aerial superiority over Lebanon , Levitt argued otherwise . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s complicated and Israel ha to take more precaution , but Israel can still go where it need to , when it need to , to get what it need . & rdquo ; Matthew Levitt & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s complicated , and Israel ha to take more precaution , but Israel can still go where it need to , when it need to , to get what it need , & rdquo ; he said.The group also ha significant battlefield experience after their engagement on the side of Bashar Assad during the Syrian civil war.Hezbollah & rsquo ; s elite Radwan force are a force to be feared and are spread across southern Lebanon waiting for the order to attack Israel . & ldquo ; You have to take the Radwan force seriously , & rdquo ; said Levitt.In addition to the on-the-job training and weapon ( including American-made AR-15s ) , the Radwan force & ldquo ; are disciplined , & rdquo ; Levitt noted . And while they face challenge such a the loss of senior operative , many of the Radwan troop & ldquo ; only know fighting in Syria . & rdquo ; While tension have risen significantly between Israel and Hezbollah , the intelligence community doe not think that Nasrallah would drag the entire region into war over the gas rig.The extraction of the gas and the potential signing of a deal between Israel and Lebanon , mediated by the United States , also come a the West belief there will not be a nuclear deal signed with Iran.Iran already sends $ 800 million annually to Hezbollah , and the lack of a deal would not stop the Islamic Republic from continuing to fund them . & ldquo ; Iran prioritizes them , and withdrawing from the JCPOA did nothing . They can afford it , & rdquo ; said Levitt.Gordin , who took over the Northern Command from Maj . - Gen . Amir Baram on Sunday evening , know that some sort of confrontation with Hezbollah will happen under his watch & ndash ; be it a limited round of violence like what happens with Gaza , or a full-blown devastating war between the two sides.Hezbollah took many risk under Baram & rsquo ; s tenure , including firing an anti-tank missile toward an empty military ambulance in 2019 and firing 19 rocket toward empty field last summer . The group also launched drone toward the Karish gas field in early July.None of those event led to an outbreak of war , but one miscalculation and the story could be totally different.Israel ha warned that any infrastructure in Lebanon that serf Hezbollah is a military target . The military ha said that it already ha thousand of target at the ready in it target bank.With Lebanon already amid an economic collapse , a war with Israel could lead the country to utter devastation.Is Nasrallah ready to risk that ?",will hezbollah ' scratch it resistance itch ' and attack israel ? - interview

2024-04-22 18:55:21.173,jpost,"Interior Minister Moshe Arbel of Shas is unlike many other Israeli politicians.For one thing , he doesn & rsquo ; t particularly want to be a politician , and doesn & rsquo ; t have higher political aspiration . If it were up to him , he would be far from the public eye , working on his doctorate in law or spending time with his family.For another , at the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7 , Arbel requested of party leader MK Arye Deri to relieve him of the dual duty of interior minister and health minister and leave him just with the former , due to the immense workload of running these two major ministry during wartime . Power and influence are currency for politician , and who else in Israel & rsquo ; s political scene today volunteer to give up a major ministry ? & ldquo ; I see myself in the political arena a a reservist and not a career officer , & rdquo ; Arbel said . His use of military jargon is also rare for a haredi politician & ndash ; indeed , Arbel served in the IDF and in the reserve for year until he became a member of Knesset.He said he is & ldquo ; not motivated by survivability , & rdquo ; and that it doe not matter to him whether he serf another term in politics or not . As a result , he is focused not on reaping short-term achievement but & ldquo ; preparing the ministry & rsquo ; s foundation & rdquo ; so that , when he & ldquo ; hand the key over & rdquo ; to his successor , the ministry will be better than it is now . & ldquo ; The State of Israel need people who enter public role with modesty and with the understanding that they have not conquered territory but are there to serve the public , & rdquo ; he said.Moshe Arbel 's political , rabbinic , and IDF careerARBEL , 40 , is a father of four and life in Petah Tikva . Public service run in the family , a his father served on the Petah Tikva Religious Council and wa a Shas activist . But Arbel himself wa a full-time Torah student until his mid-twenties , and wa ordained a a rabbi . He then joined the IDF Home Front Command in a unit responsible for identifying corps ; earned bachelor & rsquo ; s and master & rsquo ; s degree in law from the Ono Academic College ; served in the IDF reserve a a military prosecutor ; earned a business administration certificate from Harvard University ; and began a doctorate in law at Reichman University.Following the 2013 national election , Arbel served a a legal adviser for Shas , a a legislation adviser to then Knesset member and current Labor Minister Yoav Ben-Tzur , and a a chief of staff for Deri . In April 2023 he wa appointed a both health minister and interior minister , after Deri wa blocked from the position due to previous criminal convictions.The Jerusalem Post interviewed Arbel in his Knesset office on April 8 , and the first issue to be discussed wa the ongoing crisis over the haredi exemption from IDF service . As both a longtime haredi yeshiva student and a long-serving IDF reservist , Arbel & rsquo ; s perspective is important.His approach can be summarized a follows : The IDF ha a real need for soldier , and haredi men who do not study Torah full-time should commit to IDF or other national service . At the same time , Torah study isn & rsquo ; t just a spiritual vocation but an enterprise of national importance.Arbel called this & ldquo ; the national story of a group of Torah student . . . who labor day and night over the Torah , & rdquo ; out of which will grow & ldquo ; great Torah [ scholar ] with broad shoulder . & rdquo ; According to Arbel , these & ldquo ; broad-shouldered & rdquo ; talent are necessary in order to uphold the tradition of & ldquo ; the power of leniency , & rdquo ; a leading policy in the halachic ruling of former Sephardi chief rabbi and Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef . & ldquo ; The day where we enter the debate with the deep understanding that there is a national , ethical duty to maintain these Torah student , along with the duty to maintain an economic , military , and socially prosperous state , we can create an ecosystem of understanding that doe not wish to erase the identity of the other side , & rdquo ; Arbel said.This fundamental premise is more important than the detail of a specific haredi conscription plan , he added.Furthermore , Arbel argued that enabling haredi men to serve in the IDF while maintaining their lifestyle is a liberal value a well & ndash ; IDF service isn & rsquo ; t just a duty , it is also a right . The IDF currently doe this & ldquo ; sufficiently & rdquo ; and should continue doing so , he said . He stressed that yeshiva student who were not actually studying and who were & ldquo ; catching a ride & rdquo ; on the blanket exemption should serve in the IDF like all other citizens.Arbel & rsquo ; s approach regarding Torah study and IDF service reflects a broader view on haredi education in general . He explained that the major haredi school system teach a core secular curriculum of some form , but that this need to be expanded and improved . His son , for example , studied at a haredi high school yeshiva , which combined long hour of Torah study with full matriculation exam . There are many such initiative sprouting up , and & ldquo ; good thing are happening & rdquo ; & ndash ; but the state need to facilitate this & ndash ; for example , by lowering the high cost of the institution that offer these sort of combinations.Arbel didn & rsquo ; t rule out giving haredi teen the option of studying Torah full-time . He himself studied only Torah in his teen and completed matriculation requirement later on , and the year of Torah study granted him a work ethic and analytic skill that served him later on in life . But such a system is not appropriate for everyone and should not be forced on haredi teen who aren & rsquo ; t equipped for it , he argued.ARBEL & rsquo ; S WORK in the Interior Ministry ha garnered praise from both side of the political divide , and the ministry wa favorably mentioned for it work following the October 7 Hamas massacre.Asked about this , Arbel wa quick to give credit to the ministry worker . He explained that the ministry includes three branch and described it adaptation post-October 7 in each branch . These change led to a learning process that led to broader initiative not just related to war.The three branch are the local authority ; immigration and citizenship ; and urban planning and development.Following October 7 , the local authority required receiving special power and funding , especially those whose resident were attacked and/or evacuated . On the issue of immigration and citizenship , many of these evacuee left their home without their passport or other identification paper , and the ministry created roaming emergency office that went to hotel in order to provide service for the evacuee . Finally , on the issue of urban planning and development , Arbel had the ministry pas temporary executive order to cut bureaucracy in order to speedily construct new school and medical center for the evacuees.In the day and week after the massacre , some of the survivor were traumatized to the extent that they were not willing to leave their hotel room in order to meet with the roaming immigration office . This led Arbel to wonder why they could not order new document online , and he worked with the defense and other authority to begin providing this service , whose pilot is set to begin at the end of April . Wait time in Israel for immigration service such a renewing a passport are notoriously long , and the ability to order a new passport online could drastically improve this . The idea to enable online documentation order wa an example of how the ministry & rsquo ; s ad hoc adaptation to war need led to broader initiative , Arbel explained.He said he also put a specific emphasis on service to Arab municipality . & ldquo ; On the day I entered office I said that we must understand that we are public servant of all of the citizen of Israel & ndash ; those who voted for u and those who didn & rsquo ; t , even those who are acting against u , & rdquo ; Arbel said.He added that at a certain point when there were protester outside of his home , he said to his child that he is happy to live in a country in which people can protest outside the home of elected official , which is not to be taken for granted.Dealing with Arab municipality includes unique challenge & ndash ; a major one , for example , wa Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich refusing in 2023 to channel NIS 200 million of funding due to the concern that it could end up in the hand of criminal organization . Arbel confronted Smotrich and succeeded in getting the fund through . In some rare case , there were also management problem , such a certain family who won the municipal election refusing to provide service to other family . Arbel added that & ldquo ; good thing & rdquo ; are happening in Arab local authority , citing a an example the town Jatt near Haifa , which elected in the recent municipal election a young engineer who is unaffiliated with large family . This show that resident understand the importance of proper governance aimed first and foremost at improving their daily lives.Arbel view local authority a key factor in bridging social gap . & ldquo ; The goal of local authority is to break through cement ceiling , & rdquo ; he said . Socioeconomic gap in Israel are unacceptably high for a country the size of a district in California , and correct investment by municipality , such a in fundamental aspect of formal and informal education & ndash ; schoolroom , teacher , hot meal , etc . & ndash ; could serve a the basis for real social mobility , which Arbel said is & ldquo ; one of the most significant tool in our national resilience . & rdquo ; The war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in antisemitism worldwide since October 7 ha led to increased interest by Diaspora Jews in moving to Israel . Another notable initiative that Arbel mentioned wa creating an & ldquo ; aliyah eligibility document . & rdquo ; What happens , Arbel explained , is that potential olim sometimes express interest in moving to Israel but do not follow through with the process , such that if they want to renew it later on they will have to start afresh . Instead , Arbel proposed enabling these family to complete all of the necessary paperwork without actually making the move & ndash ; and thus enabling them to make aliyah immediately in the future if they wish.Arbel preferred not to express his view on the situation in Gaza and the public debate about how much Israel should concede in a hostage deal . But perhaps more important than his work in the Interior Ministry and his support of haredi enlistment is his sympathy for the family of the hostages.He said he is concerned by criticism that minister had not met enough with the family of hostage since the war broke out , and said that he meet at least once a week with a family . The meeting are difficult , and the family are experiencing immense pain and anger , but a a government minister Arbel said he doe not have the right to avoid the family . He added that he & ldquo ; allows himself to cry with the family , & rdquo ; and that his moral duty is & ldquo ; first and foremost to see their pain . & rdquo ; & nbsp ;","haredi , harvard , home front command : the enigma of moshe arbel"
2024-03-30 21:16:34.817,jpost,"Simona Steinbrecher had no information about her youngest daughter , Doron , for more than 100 day after Hamas kidnapped her from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on the morning of October 7 . The last message Simona received from Doron wa a WhatsApp voice note in which she mentioned that the terrorist had taken her . & ldquo ; Around 10 am , Doron called me and said she heard terrorist and wa afraid . She wa cry . Then she sent an audio message saying that they got her . It wa terrible . Until now , I go to sleep and wake up with her voice in my head , & rdquo ; Simona said.After 107 day of captivity , on January 26 , Hamas released a video featuring Doron and two other hostage , Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev . The video wa edited together , and the woman asked the Israeli government to bring them back home . & ldquo ; I wa very happy when I saw the video because , until then , we heard nothing about Doron . No one who came back saw her . But with that , I wa very afraid and worried because I can see that she is not well . Now I can & rsquo ; t even think about how terrible it is for her to be in Gaza all this time , & rdquo ; Simona added.According to Simona , Doron ha a serious hormonal health issue and need to have medicine every day . & ldquo ; I can see from how she look in the video that they didn & rsquo ; t give her the medicine , & rdquo ; Simona said.The hostage who have returned from Gaza have shared with Simona alarming report . The situation is dire , with severe shortage of food , water , and a place to sleep . The remaining female hostage there are facing especially brutal treatment by the terrorist . Simona is gravely concerned about the situation and emphasizes the urgent need for global attention to address it . & ldquo ; We heard the story of the people who came back from Gaza , and they say terrible thing , & rdquo ; she said , adding : & ldquo ; We are very afraid about what is happening there . & rdquo ; Simona relayed the story of returned hostage Amit Soussana , who recounted sexual assault while in captivity , a thought that terrifies Doron & rsquo ; s mother.Amit shared with the world that while in Gaza , she wa held alone , chained up in darkness and wa forced to commit sexual act for her Hamas captor . & ldquo ; What else doe the world need to know ? & rdquo ; asked Simona . & ldquo ; Why do they say it [ sexual assault ] is not happening there , when the woman who are coming back tell u that it happened ? The whole world should cry about it and do everything to stop this ! & rdquo ; exclaimed Simona , an incredibly strong and courageous woman whose feeling are beyond description . & ldquo ; That morning , my daughter wa in bed in her pajama , and they took her . What did she do to them ? Why take her ? They took baby , little kid , woman , elderly & mdash ; everyone ! For what ? & rdquo ; she asked.Despite experiencing unimaginable emotional pain and horror , Simona continues to fiercely fight for the world to recognize the heinous crime being committed against hostage and unite to combat terrorism once and for all . & ldquo ; The world need to know how brutal Hamas is , & rdquo ; Simona insisted . & ldquo ; They are not people ; they just want to kill . I don & rsquo ; t understand why the world doesn & rsquo ; t scream about what is happening . The world need to tell them to stop . & rdquo ; Simona belief that the problem in the ongoing conflict is not Israel but rather Hamas & rsquo ; refusal to engage in negotiation and reach an agreement . & ldquo ; Sinwar doesn & rsquo ; t want a deal , & rdquo ; she said , referring to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar . & ldquo ; When we [ Israel ] are close to the deal , he always ha new condition he want Israel to do . How can you make a deal with someone who change his mind all the time ? It is impossible , & rdquo ; she claimed.Simona & rsquo ; s message is clear and urgent : We must unite a a global community with a singular objective & mdash ; to exert pressure on Hamas to release the hostage and agree to a cease-fire . Only collective effort can make a difference , according to Simona . & ldquo ; We need Qatar , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , the United States and all the other country to tell Hamas : & lsquo ; now you have to make this deal , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; Simona pleaded . & ldquo ; I want the world to see the real picture of what happened here , & rdquo ; she said.Simona strongly belief that there is a frightening connection between terrorism in Israel and the recent attack happening around the world . She emphasizes that the world need to recognize this trend and understand that what Israel is going through now is just the tip of the iceberg of a much larger , global problem . & ldquo ; We see the attack that are happening in France , in England , in the United States , in Russia . People need to think and realize that if we don & rsquo ; t stop them [ terrorist ] now , they will come to your country , & rdquo ; she explained.Even amid the fear and desperation of not having seen her daughter in six month , Simona & rsquo ; s thought extend to the innocent people in Gaza . She belief that defeating Hamas will be the key to providing relief to those who are currently enduring the harsh reality of war , a Hamas is responsible for the fact that people in the region do not have food . & ldquo ; The whole world must stop Hamas also to save innocent people in Gaza . Hamas doesn & rsquo ; t let them take food , and this is the real picture , & rdquo ; asserted Simona , who continued to share detail of some of the crime committed by Hamas and it leader , Sinwar , towards people in the region.She also asserted that despite receiving aid from other country and Israel , Hamas hoard food for themselves and prevents civilian from accessing it by resorting to violence and killing Gazans who attempt to take the aid . & ldquo ; People in Gaza don & rsquo ; t have food not because Israel doesn & rsquo ; t give it to them , but because Hamas doesn & rsquo ; t let anyone have it , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; The world need to know the truth . Sinwar doesn & rsquo ; t care about his people . If the world want good for the civilian in Gaza . they must tell Sinwar to make a deal , & rdquo ; added Simona.Simona Recounts the Horror of Oct . 7 & ldquo ; It began at six and a half in the morning . Hamas came from the air , with the car , from all the place , and there were hundred of them in our kibbutz , & rdquo ; recounted Simona , who described how on the day of the massacre , couple , individual , and family living in Kfar Aza had to stay in their safe room for up to 13 hour , a did many other people in the South . & ldquo ; Think about little kid who needed to be in a safe room for 11 hour , with no water and no food , in the dark . It wa terrible for them , and until now , child speak about this , & rdquo ; said Simona.Recalling what she saw with her own eye , Simona added : & ldquo ; I saw how they [ Hamas terrorist ] kill people . I remember a house that burned slowly until there wasn & rsquo ; t any more fire , and I knew that a couple wa there , and I knew they were burning alive . & rdquo ; According to Simona , Hamas killed 63 people in Kfar Aza alone . & ldquo ; I want everyone who ha a daughter , sister , or mother to think about what they would do if their family had to go through the same thing . Everyone who ha a grandmother , grandfather , daughter , son , nephew , brother & mdash ; what would you do ? & rdquo ; Simona asked rhetorically.About DoronSimona & rsquo ; s daughter Doron , 31 , is a veterinary nurse . & ldquo ; She like animal and kid , and she is like a second mother to her little nephew . They love her so much . She didn & rsquo ; t do anything wrong to anyone . She always want to help everyone , & rdquo ; Simona said . & ldquo ; Her work is the thing that she like the most . All the time we had dog in our house . She brings animal to our house and take care of them , & rdquo ; she continued . & ldquo ; I want to hold her . I miss her so much . She is my baby , and I want her to come back , & rdquo ; added Simona . & ldquo ; We hear all the time that Hamas kill another hostage , and we are afraid , & rdquo ; admitted Simona .",mother of hostage victim pleads with international community to pressure hamas
2024-06-04 14:52:39.000,jpost,"& ldquo ; I played sport ever since I wa a child . I used to play soccer but mainly basketball , a I have been blessed with a height of 1.95 meter , & rdquo ; said Saleh Shaheen , 41 , a Druze paralympic athlete from Shfaram.Shaheen & rsquo ; s life began in a typical fashion . He enlisted in the IDF in 2003 a a paratrooper and also served a a commander . After his mandatory service , he enrolled in a course led by the Airports Authority and worked at the Karni Terminal on the border of the Gaza Strip a a security guard . & ldquo ; Then , on January 13 , 2005 , my life changed in just one night . & rdquo ; Three terrorist from Hamas , the PFLP , and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade penetrated the Karni Terminal by planting an explosive device in the wall ; they killed six civilian . & ldquo ; I arrived at the area of the explosion to fight the terrorist , but it wa pitch dark , a electricity wa down due to the explosion , leaving me exposed . I faced the first terrorist , and we exchanged fire . He shot four bullet towards my left leg , also damaging my stomach and intestine , & rdquo ; Shaheen said . & ldquo ; It wa pretty serious damage , though I didn & rsquo ; t feel at all that I wa injured . I shot , and the terrorist and I fell together . Two other terrorist infiltrated , and the rest of the security guard arrived . There I wa , with a dead terrorist lying next to me and an exchange of fire taking place between the guard and the terrorist over my head . I managed , with my last bit of strength , to crawl and make it to safety , where another Druze security guard saw me . He tried to lift me , but I weighed 115 kilo , so it took him two or three more attempt until he managed and brought me to the back office . & ldquo ; They put me in an ambulance and sped to Soroka [ Hospital ] . I remember the ride ; it & rsquo ; s probably the longest one I & rsquo ; ve ever had in my life . I started to feel the pain . I wanted to fall asleep , but the medic wouldn & rsquo ; t let me . When the ambulance door opened , I put my hand over my face so that no one would recognize me , and there & rsquo ; s a famous picture showing that scene . I wa in the operating room for 17 hour straight . When I woke up , I saw my parent next to me and began to fathom what had happened . I tore a main artery in my leg , and somehow , I stayed alive . & rdquo ; Shaheen stayed for three more week in Soroka until his situation wa stabilized , and then he wa sent to Rambam in Haifa , which wa more convenient for his family . & ldquo ; I spent three challenging month at Rambam , and although many people came to visit , it wasn & rsquo ; t a particularly easy time for me . I got metal implant for my leg , and I needed to train to rehabilitate them so I could attempt to go back to sport . My entire life revolved around sport until that point , & rdquo ; he reminisced.First step in Paralympic sport An acquaintance approached Shaheen a little over five year ago and suggested he try wheelchair basketball . & ldquo ; It seemed unnatural to me at first , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; I tried and fell several time and ended up thinking that I don & rsquo ; t have the strength for more fall and injury and recovering . At end of the day , I had learned to accept my injury and looked at it a my fate . I told myself that I must get up ; I can & rsquo ; t stay in the same place . So I continued training and playing wheelchair basketball in Haifa and Tel Aviv , and even tried out wheelchair badminton . & rdquo ; Shaheen ended up joining a mixed Jewish-Arab group in Majd Al-Kroum in the North , winning a national cup in the first year and making it to the Premier League.In 2019 , Shaheen wa approached again , this time with an offer to join paralympic rowing . & ldquo ; I had no idea what it wa at first . I wa told that it involved two training session every day and much traveling , & rdquo ; he recounted . & ldquo ; I hesitated at first , but I saw the challenging aspect and took my ability to the limit , and decided that this is a sport I want to be a part of . & rdquo ; Shaheen started training with a group of four , but then the condition of his leg deteriorated . The implant fell out , and he wa hospitalized again & ndash ; until he wa classified a PR2 , which is defined a having functional use of arm and trunk but with weakness or absence of leg function to slide the seat of the boat , rowing on a double boat for a duo of a man and a woman . & ldquo ; When I started this classification , they were only missing a female rower , and I wa on hold for a while . Then , one day , I received a call saying that they found a young woman , Shahar Milfelder , who had cancer at the age of 16 and had to have part of her pelvis removed . I jumped right in and went back to rowing . & rdquo ; Shaheen and Milfelder began training together only two year ago . & ldquo ; Every day , I drive around 230 kilometer , wake up at five in the morning , perform two training session , and go back . This routine is very demanding , especially at the expense of family and work . I own a convenience store and had to hire a local employee so that I could be devoted to sport alone , & rdquo ; Shaheen explained.Supported by scholarship and aid from the Israel Paralympic Committee , Shaheen and Milfelder made a significant leap and advanced to the World Championship less than a year ago . There , they missed the chance to get a ticket to the Paralympic game due to some change in category for qualification . & ldquo ; We missed the ticket by 30 hundredth of a second and even came in first place in the second round ; we were really bummed . Then , two week ago , there wa a & lsquo ; last chance & rsquo ; competition for the last two ticket . People believed in u ; we arrived a prepared a we could be . Then we finished first in the first round , and in the second one , we finished second with a difference of 40 hundredth of a second . & rdquo ; This wa enough to send the duo to the Paralympic Games . & ldquo ; I wa literally in tear , & rdquo ; said Shaheen . & ldquo ; Now we are getting back to preparing for the Olympics . Next month , we will fly for a long training camp , and then in August , we will move to Paris to give our performance at the Olympics . I want to thank the Paralympics Association for it trust and support in all field , from nutrition to treatment , scholarship , and even travel reimbursement . & rdquo ; Back at home , Shaheen said that his community had barely heard of this branch of sport . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not really well known in my society . Not many people at home contacted me , except the sport department in the municipality . Truth be told , I myself didn & rsquo ; t know anything about it before I started , and I didn & rsquo ; t realize how fascinating and challenging the world of rowing can be . & rdquo ; For this reason , Shaheen said he hope to change thing in the future . & ldquo ; Hopefully , after the Olympics , I will work to promote rowing in Israel generally and in the North more specifically , & rdquo ; he said.Asked what he is looking forward to most , Shaheen said that , more than anything , he is excited to leave a mark in history . & ldquo ; My message is that to achieve your dream , you must stop everything and focus on the goal . It & rsquo ; s true that I had to put my business to the side and that it come at the expense of other thing . But this is what it take to make your dream come true . & rdquo ;",druze rower qualifies for paralympic game with jewish counterpart

2024-05-14 12:05:53.173,jpost,"Heading in a north-easterly direction from the Arc de Triomphe down Avenue Hoch to number 37 , one reach Le Royal Monceau hotel ; at it entrance , a red portico and statued head that cast their gaze over everyone who pass through.The hotel , once a beehive of activity for diplomat , intellectual , artist , celebrity , and even the commander of the Allied Armed force during World War II , in 1946 hosted one of the more curious chance meeting between two political luminary of the 20th century.Fresh from Black Saturday & ndash ; the arrest of 3,000 Jews , including most of the Zionist executive leadership across Palestine & ndash ; and the sealing of Jewish Agency building on June 28 , David Ben-Gurion , then-leader of the Jewish Agency , sat in his hotel room pondering his organization & rsquo ; s next move . & nbsp ; Paris , in the early post-war year , wa the European center of Zionist activity . While in the city , Ben-Gurion wa helping to coordinate the westward migration of Jews who had survived the Holocaust in Eastern Europe , Jews he had hoped would be interested in emigrating to Palestine to help found a new Jewish state . & nbsp ; Staying on the floor above Ben-Gurion at Le Royal Monceau wa a & nbsp ; skinny gentleman with the elliptical eye distinct to native of Indochina , his hairline receding , and a thin , wispy goatee resting on his chin . To his family , growing up , he wa known a Nguyễn Sinh Cung , but by 1946 , he wa the prime minister of the newly-found Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( North Vietnam ) and known to the rest of the world a Ho Chi Minh.That summer , Ho Chi Minh wa in Paris for follow-up talk surrounding Vietnamese independence from the French . Although captured by the Japanese during WWII , French Indochina had long been a colonial jewel in the French empire & rsquo ; s crown with important natural and strategic resource , it prominent location close to China and other trade routes.Ben-Gurion related to former Maariv correspondent Shmuel Segev , who would write a book on Vietnam , that each day for two week , Ho Chi Minh would come down to his room or he would climb a flight of stair to the Vietnamese leader & rsquo ; s quarter , and the two would talk.During one conversation , Ben-Gurion shared insight into his ongoing problem , prompting Ho Chi Minh to suggest the establishment of a Jewish government in North Vietnam . & ldquo ; He gave the impression of being a nice man , & rdquo ; Ben-Gurion would later recall of Ho Chi Minh . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; During one of those conversation , he proposed that I immediately establish a Jewish government-in-exile on Vietnamese territory . I thanked him and said that when the time came , I would consider his offer . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Despite sharing a roof , and becoming & ldquo ; very friendly & rdquo ; over the week a the former Israeli prime minister stated , & ldquo ; for obvious reason , [ the offer ] wa unacceptable . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; I am certain that we shall be able to establish a Jewish government in Palestine , & rdquo ; Ben-Gurion reportedly said , adding that if he wrote to Ho Chi Minh , the latter might invite him to visit North Vietnam . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; He didn & rsquo ; t use Communist slogan , & rdquo ; Ben-Gurion said , adding that Ho Chi Minh desired to give the impression that he wa a nationalist leader fighting only for his people & rsquo ; s independence . & nbsp ; Ben-Gurion also related how he had been able to judge how the Vietnamese negotiation were proceeding with the French by the length of the red carpet at Ho Chi Minh & rsquo ; s door . & ldquo ; At first , the red carpet extended from the street to HoChi Minh & rsquo ; s door , & rdquo ; the Jewish leader recalled . & ldquo ; In stage , it wa removed from the pavement outside , the lobby , and the staircase . & ldquo ; When the carpet outside his door wa removed , I knew the talk had failed , and sure enough , a few hour later , he came to my room to say goodbye . He wa tired , worn out , and disappointed , and he told me nothing remained but to fight . & rdquo ; A few month later , the First Indochina War began between Vietnamese force and France.Two road to independenceDESPITE THE close relationship developed over only a couple of week one Paris summer , diplomatic relation between Vietnam and Israel took decade to come to fruition.On Friday , May 14 , 1948 , David Ben-Gurion stood in Tel Aviv and formally declared the independent State of Israel . The next day , the Arab army of Egypt , Syria , Jordan , and Iraq invaded , along with a corp of volunteer from Saudi Arabia , Lebanon , and Yemen . The burgeoning Jewish State prevailed , although it would face many more obstacle down the road for it freedom.The fight for Vietnamese independence would take a much darker and longer path.While Vietnam wa formally partitioned into South and North Vietnam in 1954 , at the end of the First Indochina War , with Israel supporting the Geneva Agreements , diplomatic relation between the two nation never materialized . & nbsp ; Communist North Vietnam maintained a strong relationship with the socialist power of the day , the Soviet Union and Maoist China , while also cultivating tie with the Arab nation . Israel , on the other side of the metaphorical global Iron Curtain , provided technical aid to South Vietnam without establishing formal diplomatic channels.In June 1967 , a Israel launched a pre-emptive strike against the army of Egypt , Syria , and Jordan , North Vietnam & rsquo ; s President Ho Chi Minh wrote in a personal wire to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser , & ldquo ; We are highly indignant at the action of Israeli reactionary agent of the United States and British imperialist . They are doomed to ignominious defeat . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; By 1967 , the North Vietnamese and their communist army , the Viet Cong , were busy themselves fighting a guerilla war against the South Vietnamese and their US ally . By 1969 , over half a million US troop were stationed in the country , and the Vietnam War would claim the life of almost 60,000 US serviceman and women.Ho Chi Minh would die in September 1969 , never living to see the united , communist Vietnam that he had dreamed of and fought so long for . In 1975 , two year after the official end of US military involvement , South Vietnam & rsquo ; s capital , Saigon , fell to the Viet Cong and wa renamed Ho Chi Minh City . & nbsp ; Ben-Gurion & rsquo ; s death would follow that of his revolutionary friend a few year later , in December 1973 . After his final year following his retirement from politics living in a modest home in Kibbutz Sde Boker in the Negev Desert , he wa buried there alongside his wife , Paula.Israel-Vietnam relationsISRAEL AND VIETNAM & rsquo ; S path would cross relatively infrequently over the following decade , with one particular infamous encounter taking place . & nbsp ; On June 10 , 1977 , a remarkable rescue operation unfolded when the Israeli freighter ship , the Yuvali , bound for Taiwan , spotted a group of passenger in need . This group , consisting of approximately 66 Vietnamese refugee , marked the beginning of a series of arrival in Israel between 1977 and 1979 of over 300 people fleeing communist Vietnam.Israeli prime minister at the time , Menachem Begin , drew a poignant parallel , likening the plight of these refugee to that of Holocaust survivor . & nbsp ; Begin famously remarked , & ldquo ; We have never forgotten the boat with 900 Jews , St . Louis , having left Germany in the last week before the Second World War . . . traveling from harbor to harbor , from country to country , cry out for refuge . They were refused . . . Therefore , it wa natural . . . to give those people a haven in the Land of Israel . & rdquo ; Inspired by this ethos of compassion and solidarity , Begin directed Israeli diplomat to extend a lifeline to the Vietnamese refugee , offering them asylum in Israel . In a poignant moment captured by an Associated Press broadcast on October 26 , 1979 , a grateful refugee expressed profound appreciation to the government of Israel and to Begin , acknowledging their role in opening their homeland at a time when other nation hesitated to offer assistance in the face of communist oppression.Vietnam and Israel would finally establish official diplomatic relation on July 12 , 1993 , followed by Israel opening it resident embassy in the capital Hanoi in December 1993Ben-Gurion & rsquo ; s recollection of his Paris meeting with the tall , skinny Vietnamese man , spotlight the convergence of two revolutionary movement in one place and offer a unique perspective on one of the most important & ndash ; and instrumental & ndash ; period in the 20th century . & nbsp ; In the post-WWII world , with national border being redrawn , either along class line or ethnicity line , two dedicated men had found themselves in a Parisian hotel room , drawn together by history and the common bond of their enduring fight for their people & rsquo ; s independence . ",a tale of two leader : the paris meeting between ben-gurion and ho chi minh

2021-05-13 22:07:53.850,jpost,"& nbsp ; On Wednesday , the US-Israel relationship seemed , well , normal . The US wa supporting Israel in the way it always ha in the repeated confrontation with Hamas since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 . & nbsp ; The US blocked the United Nations Security Council from making a statement that wa critical of Israel . & nbsp ; US President Joe Biden called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , & ldquo ; condemned the rocket attack by Hamas . . . [ and ] conveyed his unwavering support for Israel & rsquo ; s security and for Israel & rsquo ; s legitimate right to defend itself , while protecting civilian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized that & ldquo ; there is a very clear and absolute distinction between the terrorist organization Hamas that is indiscriminately raining down rocket targeting civilian , and Israel & rsquo ; s response defending itself , targeting the terrorist raining down rocket on Israel . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Blinken dispatched Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr to Israel to help in the de-escalation effort . & nbsp ; But all that happened on Wednesday , three day after Hamas shot rocket into Jerusalem and five day after a serious uptick in violence in Jerusalem . These are short amount of time in the grand scheme of thing , but a long time in term of an escalation . & nbsp ; The night before that , at the very same time that Hamas shot 150 rocket into Tel Aviv and central Israel , sending million of Israelis into bomb shelter , the Biden administration & rsquo ; s spokespeople synced up on a & ldquo ; both side & rdquo ; message , despite one side being Israel , a US ally and a democracy , and the other being Hamas , designated by the US a a terrorist organization . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We condemn ongoing rocket attack by Hamas and other terrorist group , including against Jerusalem . We also stand against extremism that ha inflicted violence on both community , & rdquo ; White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said . & nbsp ; Psaki soon moved on to adopt the Palestinians & rsquo ; narrative that this is about the Sheikh Jarrah/Shimon Hatzadik land dispute & ndash ; the ruling on which ha yet to be made , and whose resident have not actually been evicted & ndash ; rather than taking in the context of rising Palestinian and Arab violence for the past month . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We believe Palestinians and Israelis deserve equal measure of freedom , security , dignity , and prosperity , & rdquo ; Psaki said . & ldquo ; And US official , in recent week , have spoken candidly with Israeli official about how eviction of Palestinian family who have lived for year , sometimes decade , in their home and of demolition of these home work against our common interest in achieving a solution to the conflict . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Similarly , State Department spokesman Ned Price said minute earlier that & ldquo ; Israel ha the right to defend itself and to respond to rocket attack . The Palestinian people also have the right to safety and security , just a Israelis do . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We are also deeply concerned about the reported loss of life in Gaza and Israel , including the death of child a well a many innocent civilian injured . Similarly , in Jerusalem , where there reportedly have been hundred of Palestinians injured , a well a Israeli police , we call on all side to exercise restraint and to exercise calm . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Emerging from bomb shelter soon after those statement were made , the Israelis paying attention to Psaki and Price may have scratched their head a to why Israel & rsquo ; s greatest ally wa lecturing them while they were rushing their family to safety from rocket launched indiscriminately at civilian by a terrorist organization . & nbsp ; Over the past week , the Biden administration & rsquo ; s message also focused on & ldquo ; de-escalation . & rdquo ; They & rsquo ; re engaging at all level , official and spokespeople said , to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to de-escalate . Pushed by journalist in numerous press briefing to explain what that mean , what they & rsquo ; re actually doing to bring the side away from the brink of war , the member and representative of the administration didn & rsquo ; t have much to say . & nbsp ; MORE THAN one senior Israeli official said they & rsquo ; re satisfied with the US position , pointing to statement by Biden and Blinken , a well a another by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan , a & ldquo ; very supportive , & rdquo ; a well a to American effort in the UN to block the statement against Israel . & nbsp ; In other word , the thing that they are doing , on a practical level , are supportive of Israel , and they are keeping Israel in the loop , a an ally would be expected to do . & nbsp ; Israeli official also said they don & rsquo ; t feel that the US is pressuring them to stop the operation in Gaza , another clear sign of support . & nbsp ; But one of those Israeli official also said that they & ldquo ; don & rsquo ; t have a clue . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; For four month , the Biden administration made Israel and the Palestinians a low priority . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; They didn & rsquo ; t even think about Gaza and Hamas , & rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo ; When the Palestinian election came up , they didn & rsquo ; t know how to handle it . Elections are a democratic value , but Hamas could be elected , so they played the same game Israel did . They didn & rsquo ; t oppose it publicly , but they sent message they won & rsquo ; t be mad if it & rsquo ; s postponed . . . . And now Hamas is frustrated . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; On the one hand , the Biden administration & ndash ; from Blinken and Sullivan to Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield to State Department official & ndash ; really is constantly in contact with Israelis , a it member have been saying in their statement and briefing . & nbsp ; On the other , the administration ha been fixated on Jerusalem , the Temple Mount and Sheikh Jarrah in private conversation , accepting the Palestinian narrative on the event . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Nothing changed on the Temple Mount , except that Hamas is trying to present itself a defending the holy place , like Arafat did in 2000 . . . . Hamas is frustrated that the Palestinian Authority postponed the election , thought it would strengthen them , and now they & rsquo ; re trying to build themselves up . The narrative that Jerusalem is the real problem is that of our opponent , & rdquo ; the Israeli official said . & nbsp ; Israeli official have found themselves being asked by member of the Biden administration to stop a possible Supreme Court ruling to evict four Palestinian family from Sheikh Jarrah . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t even understand the argument , & rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo ; We & rsquo ; re a democracy . We did the maximum to postpone the ruling , but we don & rsquo ; t control the court . It & rsquo ; s the same court that evicts settler . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; As for complaint about Israel using stun grenade in the al-Aksa Mosque , the official pointed out that Israeli police do not use gun at the holy site , but that people throwing boulder at worshiper at the Western Wall and Molotov cocktail at police can not be given immunity just because they use a mosque a a launching pad . & nbsp ; An Israeli official also expressed concern that the Biden administration is more supportive in private conversation than in public statement . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; They used to say that Israel doesn & rsquo ; t have foreign policy , only domestic politics . Our feeling is they & rsquo ; re constantly looking at the left-wing extreme [ of the Democratic Party ] that are against u and their pressure on them , & rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo ; They & rsquo ; re putting Jerusalem in all their message , even though it & rsquo ; s not really connected , and then they talk about the need for restraint on both side . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; In a way , it seemed like the administration wa caught off guard when the violence spiraled . & nbsp ; Some have argued that the government in Jerusalem did not take the potential for a conflagration seriously enough , and Israel will have to reckon with how it leadership vacuum left it unprepared . That may have colored Washington & rsquo ; s initial reaction . & nbsp ; But it didn & rsquo ; t have to be that way . UAE-based news site The National said that & ldquo ; Washington began to pay attention to message from Arab government only last week , & rdquo ; after week of warning that a crisis wa brewing in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Shira Efron , a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies , also noted the & ldquo ; bifurcated message & rdquo ; coming from the Biden administration , with message that create an equivalence between Israel and it enemy , while also saying & ldquo ; this is a just fight , Hamas is a cruel terrorist organization and Israel should fight back . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Reading between the line , Efron said she think the Biden administration is & ldquo ; saying Israel ha got it ; they can handle it . I don & rsquo ; t see them actively working to de-escalate . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Even Amr & rsquo ; s visit may be largely symbolic , because , a Efron pointed out , the US doesn & rsquo ; t speak with Hamas . At most , Amr can work with other mediator that do speak with Hamas , like Turkey , Qatar or Egypt , and then relay message to Israel . & nbsp ; Efron questioned whether the Biden administration ha & ldquo ; a road map for de-escalation . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; She noted the Biden administration ha de-emphasized the Israeli-Palestinian conflict : & ldquo ; They have bigger fish to fry , like China or climate change , but the fact is that there is no assistant secretary for Near East affair , and there is no ambassador here . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Even the most competent and well-meaning person & ndash ; and I think [ Amr ] doe mean well & ndash ; can not do this on his own , & rdquo ; Efron said . & ldquo ; He ha no staff , and I don & rsquo ; t think this is a priority issue & rdquo ; for the Biden administration . & nbsp ; If the latest event are a wake-up call for the administration , it still can not immediately solve it lack of preparation for a crisis in the region , Efron said . It will take time for Congress to confirm presidential appointment . & nbsp ; THE TONE from Washington would have been drastically different if former president Donald Trump were still in office , but Efron pushed back against the argument that there would be significant change on the ground . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think this ha much to do with the US approach . Biden said they & rsquo ; re going to go back to a more traditional approach , but the fact is that not much ha changed . It hasn & rsquo ; t been transformational ; it & rsquo ; s not like the Palestinians are now welcome in Washington with a PLO mission , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Rather , Efron argued , between Ramadan , COVID-19 frustration and the cancellation of the Palestinian election , violence against Israel wa a & ldquo ; win-win & rdquo ; for Hamas , and the US reaction wa unlikely to be a primary or even secondary consideration . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; In 2009 , 2012 and 2014 , there were lengthy IDF operation where we had a US that wa more active in favor of the Palestinians , and that didn & rsquo ; t help either , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Prof . Eytan Gilboa of Bar-Ilan University , however , argued that Trump would have more full-throatedly condemned Hamas and Islamic Jihad , and that would have had a palpable impact . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Trump punished the Palestinians . Biden is trying to appease them . So I think there would have been a different story if Trump had been in the White House , in term of opposing and condemning Islamic Jihad and Hamas and supporting Israel more , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s strategy , Gilboa explained , is to punish Hamas and Islamic Jihad severely , which will take time . US statement calling to stop hostility weakens Israel in pursuit of that strategy . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The American response overall ha been timid , disappointing and irrelevant . . . saying Palestinians in Gaza have the right for safety and security just a Israelis do . . . a if this is a confrontation between equal , & rdquo ; Gilboa said . & ldquo ; Both side are called on to reduce hostility & ndash ; Israel and a terrorist organization designated by the US . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not evenhandedness . It & rsquo ; s stupidity . This inadvertently encourages Hamas and Islamic Jihad to continue , & rdquo ; he added . & nbsp ; Similar to the Israeli official , Gilboa thought the Biden administration ha read the situation wrong by focusing on Sheikh Jarrah , which he called & ldquo ; irrelevant . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The main point is Hamas and Islamic Jihad & rsquo ; s goal of turning the West Bank into Gaza , of taking it over . . . . If you don & rsquo ; t understand that , then your policy will miss the point , & rdquo ; he stated . & ldquo ; The alumnus of the Obama administration seem to have learned nothing . They & rsquo ; re presented a very experienced in foreign policy and national security ; that ha yet to be proven . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; By making the Middle East a lower priority , Biden will now learn that & ldquo ; if you run away from the Middle East , the Middle East run after you , & rdquo ; Gilboa warned . & ldquo ; The US ha to take a position . . . . It requires fresh thinking , but what I see are old habit . & rdquo ;","a israel-palestinian conflict rage , biden struggle to catch up"

2024-05-04 21:50:24.507,jpost,"In the stark confines of Eshel Prison near Beersheba , Israel , an unconventional class of student recently completed an extraordinary educational journey . Last week , a group of 13 inmate graduated from a groundbreaking Holocaust education project unlike any traditional academic setting . These were n't ordinary student ; they were prisoner , some serving life sentence for serious crime , others detained for minor offense . Yet , they all shared a new academic pursuit & mdash ; understanding the Holocaust , it historical significance , and the indelible lesson it imparts on courage and humanity.Across Israel , this initiative is part of a broader educational movement within the penal system . Over the past few month , more than 150 inmate engaged in similar program , and a total of 300 were expected to complete their study by the year 's end . The program 's uniqueness lie not only in it setting but in it transformative impact on it participant , challenging them to rethink value and personal accountability.A glimpse inside the prison education systemFor the first time , Yad Vashem , Israel 's official memorial to the victim of the Holocaust , together with the Israeli Prison Service , allowed insight into these transformative session . During a rare and enlightening meeting with inmate , they shared how their initial encounter with story of the Holocaust moved them profoundly . The tale of suffering and heroism opened their eye to a world where human value such a courage , sacrifice , and perseverance played pivotal roles.Educating beyond the basicsThe program , known a `` Victory of the Spirit , `` provided rigorous weekly session where inmate from various background came together to learn about the Holocaust . Rabbi Tehila Heitman Demony , head of the community value sector at the prison , explained that the program aimed to instill a deep understanding of the Holocaust 's historical event while intertwining lesson on personal and communal values.This year 's curriculum , under the theme `` Communities , `` focused on fostering a sense of collective identity and responsibility & mdash ; poignant subject for individual often isolated from society . The curriculum wa scheduled to culminate in June with a day trip to Yad Vashem for prisoner who met certain behavioral and educational criterion , thus providing them with a tangible connection to the story they had studied.Transformations on a personal levelAmong the poignant narrative wa that of A ' , a young man from central Israel , convicted of manslaughter . A ' wa initially indifferent to the program but found himself profoundly affected a the course progressed . `` At first , I did n't see the relevance of the Holocaust to me , `` A ' shared . His perspective dramatically shifted when he discovered that his own grandfather wa a Holocaust survivor . This revelation deepened his engagement with the material and provided a personal connection to the history being taught.Idit , the education officer at Eshel Prison who coordinated the `` Victory of the Spirit `` project , observed significant change in the prisoner ' attitude and understanding . `` They become ambassador of knowledge , eager to share what they 've learned and inspire others within the prison community , `` Idit noted.Impacts beyond individual growthAyelet Aviv , an instructor from Yad Vashem involved since 2016 , highlighted the diverse composition of her class , which included many prisoner from minority background . `` Their thirst for knowledge is incredible , `` Aviv said . `` They are eager to learn , to ask question , and to write about their thought and feeling . It 's about educating and transforming these individual , providing them with tool for personal growth and a deeper understanding of human value . `` For M ' , an Arab Israeli imprisoned for money laundering , the program offered an insight into a crucial part of history that he had never known before . `` The only place I thought I could learn such thing wa in prison , `` M ' reflected . His statement underscored the transformative potential of education , even & mdash ; or perhaps especially & mdash ; in the most unlikely settings.As these prisoner reached the end of their course , the impact of `` Victory of the Spirit `` extended beyond the confines of their cell . It fostered a broader dialogue about history , humanity , and redemption , proving that education can indeed be a powerful catalyst for change . This project not only educates but also rebuilds individual , enabling them to emerge a informed citizen ready to contribute positively to society .

2024-04-10 00:36:25.607,jpost,"North of the Gaza Strip , the surf is pounding the beach south of Ashkelon . One of these beach is known a Zikim , and it share a name with a kibbutz on a hill above it.This is a beautiful area . There is a small pond and stream near the beach , and dune with small stout layer of brush stretch up from the waterfront toward the east . The dune form a kind of frame to the area , setting off the kibbutz and a road that run down to the sea from an industrial area of Ashkelon.Today , this area is deserted . The beach , which once hosted the toned body of young men and woman from the area who came to enjoy the spot , and the fisherman who would come on weekend to try their hand at a catch , are gone . It is all gone because Hamas attacked this beach on October 7 , when it invaded two dozen point along the border with Israel and carried out it massacre.I came to this area on October 8 , trying to reach the coastal area because there are several IDF post here . I thought that with the war unfolding , it might be a good place to find a story . At the time , I didn & rsquo ; t know there wa still fighting going on in this area , and terrorist were lurking in the bush and dunes.I learned the area wa an active combat zone when I came upon the body of two terrorist , and a still-running Savannah van parked next to them , on October 8 near the fence that run around Kibbutz Zikim . The fighting here continued for days.On October 11 , several soldier from the Maglan special unit were killed in this area . Flags with their name are now draped on a concrete shelter along the road . Inside , their comrade have written their name and left candle and a kippah in their memory.Six month laterIT HAS been six month since that day . October 8 wa the second day of the war . Six month later , I wa in Kibbutz Zikim , looking out onto the road where I had encountered the dead terrorist and the van . A member of the community recalled the same scene unfolding on October 7 from inside Zikim.Although terrorist were able to attack and infiltrate the IDF post near the border , killing soldier and massacring civilian on Zikim Beach , the kibbutz itself wa saved by the quick response of it emergency response team and soldiers.Today , the kibbutz seems like it is slowly returning to life , and some of the resident have returned . The community is laid out in a large circle , with house facing the perimeter fence , looking toward the sea . It & rsquo ; s bucolic and beautiful . It is also filled with peacock for some reason . The bird apparently escaped from a local small zoo and have infested the community for year . Because there are so few human resident , the animal seem to have the run of the place.I spent October 7 and 8 traveling along the border with Gaza , seeing community that faced the brunt of the attack on October 7 and also seeing those that were saved from the massacre . Each community ha a story & ndash ; story of tragedy , bravery , and sometimes good luck that kept people safe.Six month after the war began , it & rsquo ; s important to recall that these community are still evacuated , their resident scattered around Israel . In many case , the community tried to stick together , but they face an uncertain future.On the afternoon of October 8 , the IDF said it had evacuated Be & rsquo ; eri , Nahal Oz , Netiv Ha & rsquo ; asara , and Zikim . While Zikim had been saved from the massacre , nearby Netiv Ha & rsquo ; asara , which is directly on the border with Gaza , wa breached , and the terrorist murdered numerous member of the community . The terrorist also carried out massacre at Be & rsquo ; eri and Nahal Oz.Nahal Oz is one of the hardest community & rsquo ; s to reach today because it is close to the border , and there is an IDF checkpoint on the road leading to it . All of these community now have soldier at their front gate , and permission is required to enter.Nahal Oz is a unique case . To get to it , the road snake down by the border . Several year ago , a large concrete wall wa erected to shield the road from Gaza , and the wall wa then painted with pastoral scene and a giant mural indicating that the community wa celebrating 70 year since it founding . Unlike Zikim , there is a sense it will take time before anyone can return to this area.On October 8 , the IDF also evacuated Nir Am , Mefalsim , Kfar Aza , Gevim , Or Haner , Ivim , Yad Mordechai , Karmiya , Kerem Shalom , Kissufim , Holit , Sufa , Nirim , Nir Oz , Ein Hashlosha , Nir Yitzhak , Magen , Re & rsquo ; im , Sa & rsquo ; ad , and Alumim.Today , these community have the same struggle that Zikim and Nahal Oz face . Their resident are living in different part of Israel , and it is not clear when service will be available for people to return to or if people will feel secure enough to return.In some community , people return only for a few hour a day or several day a week . They might have job nearby , or they come to tend a garden or to do some kind of other work for the community . In the community dining hall , where there once would have been crowd or laughter , or plan for community event , there is often silence or only a few people huddled to eat.IT & rsquo ; S HARD to make sense of this . On the one hand , the war in Gaza feel like it is winding down . At the highest point in Zikim , for instance , there is an old home built in 1920 by an Arab notable who had a citrus grove near here . From the roof of the old stately home , where sandbag are piled , probably from the early day of the war , one can see into Gaza . Smoke rise , and there is a rat-tat of machine-gun fire . But the sound of artillery and explosion is no longer common.Further down the border , this is not always the case . Near the site of the Supernova music festival massacre , the sound of artillery is present . Everywhere along the border , the buzzing of drone is clear . But the heavy military presence of the first month of the war is gone.It & rsquo ; s not normal , because normal would mean the civilian resident have returned . It & rsquo ; s abnormal . But it & rsquo ; s also not war , because much of the war seems to have paused , like a country taking a deep breath and then wondering what to do next.What come next at Kibbutz Sufa , for instance ? It sits near the border and feel forlorn . At nearby Nir Yitzhak , there are square hay bale stacked in small mountain in warehouse . Clearly , the agricultural work ha gone on at a fever pitch.In fact , that & rsquo ; s another contrast on the border . Work go on everywhere in the field . In some case , it is done by foreign worker , who can be seen riding motorized bike to their work . Small Thailand flag flutter from the bikes.In one field , a giant machine with long metal arm , like a massive mechanical bug in some kind of future apocalyptic movie , ambled along watering the field . It wasn & rsquo ; t even clear if there wa a person on the machine , bringing a sense that the future here hang in the balance between civilian returning and machine taking over.This is not what the kibbutz pioneer of the late 1940s and 1950s had in mind when these community were founded . They lived in tent and farmed . They took their bolt-action rifle , and later automatic , to the field with them . They danced , and sang , and played sport . They served in elite unit . They grew old.Their descendant want to return , but so far , it is mostly the older people who express steadfastness and confidence . Those with child who were abandoned for many hour on October 7 , and had to leave on October 8 , face an uncertain future . How can they return and trust the state again to protect them ? The state hasn & rsquo ; t returned the hostage held in Gaza . There & rsquo ; s also a sense the government ha abandoned these community , that there is lack of caring for them , and that there is no government here . They are fending for themselves , like in the era of the British Mandate.These community were once the heart of the state & rsquo ; s endeavor to carve out the border of Israel . But now they feel like they have become the ultimate periphery . & nbsp ;",gaza border community struggling to recover six month after evacuation

The invitation-only cocktail reception for some 200 VIP guest wa organized with Bank Leumi and wa held in cooperation with the Israel Defense and Security Forum ( IDSF ) . AMIR AVIVI , founder of the forum , interviewed by Klein , stated that Israel is facing a global war on behalf of Western society but must seek strategic independence for war material to ensure the country & rsquo ; s defense . & ldquo ; We are facing a global war ; this is a Chinese/Russian front , & rdquo ; he said . Consequently , the US position on military operation & ldquo ; endangers not only Israel but all of Western society . & rdquo ; Avivi advocated for Israeli strategic independence in munition and other military equipment to counter the arm embargo that Israel is facing from some of it Western ally . For Israel to be able to stand on it own without relying on others is a Zionist principle , he explained.Though the IDF is destroying Hamas on the battlefield , the forum & rsquo ; s founder said , the Gazan terrorist group belief that it can survive by fostering international pressure on Israel and sparking an Israeli election.RONIT FARKASH , Director of Strategic Partnerships at IDSF , said that her son is among the soldier fighting Hamas in Gaza . A Hamas sniper shot him , and while his ceramic vest saved him , he suffered shrapnel wound and burns.Though still recovering from his wound , Farkash & rsquo ; s son returned to his unit in Gaza only a few day later because his brother in arm needed him . & ldquo ; That is the power of being united . That is the meaning of being connected to something bigger than just yourself , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; Our nation & rsquo ; s strength lie in it people and in our ability to come together in the face of adversity . We draw courage from each other , from the story of bravery and sacrifice , from the unwavering support of friend , neighbor , and even stranger . & rdquo ; IDSF CEO Lt . - Col . ( re . ) Yaron Buskila , who served in the Gaza war , described the chaos he witnessed on Oct . 7 , when people were calling him for help .

He recalled the score of car and bus carrying thousand of reservist headed south to answer the call to arm , a well a people coming from all over the world to donate food and volunteer with the soldier . & ldquo ; We are a generation of victory , & rdquo ; he said.DIASPORA AFFAIRS and Combating Antisemitism Minister Amichai Chikli , speaking with Klein , discussed the challenge Israel face in reducing Hamas & rsquo ; s military capability and the need for sustained effort similar to those following Operation Defensive Shield in 2002 . Chikli predicted that another two year of reduced military activity would be necessary in order to reach the desired level of security for Israel & rsquo ; s South.He then turned his attention to antisemitism in the US , drawing parallel between the situation in Gaza and the need for vigilance in America . He noted that despite the increase in antisemitic incident , the majority of Americans continue to support Israel.Chikli outlined his ministry & rsquo ; s multifaceted approach to combating antisemitism . & ldquo ; First of all , the main mission is to support the community in term of security , monitoring antisemitism , [ and ] investigating these organization such a SJP [ Students for Justice in Palestine ] , & rdquo ; he explained.The ministry is also focused on tracing funding source for these organization , which often receive significant contribution from charity and state like Qatar . In addition , it support local organization and campus group such a Hillel , Olami , and Chabad . Chikli mentioned the importance of delegation , such a those of the family of hostage and victim from Oct . 7 , in raising awareness and garnering support.The minister stressed the importance of continued vigilance and support for Jewish community worldwide . He said his ministry is dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of these community while also fostering a deeper connection to their heritage and the State of Israel.JERUSALEM MAYOR Moshe Lion commented that the current surge in antisemitism is reminiscent of Germany in the 1930s . & ldquo ; Far from home , we see the terrible scene you have experienced & ndash ; on campus , on the street , with attack on Jews & ndash ; like we have not seen since 1930s Germany , & rdquo ; the mayor said . & ldquo ; Have no doubt & ndash ; the Jewish people are under attack . & rdquo ; Lion described the difficult war that Israel is waging against it enemy . & ldquo ; On our border sit terror army , shooting missile on our head . Courts and parliament worldwide try to stop u from defending our people . & rdquo ; Despite the difficulty , he said , Jerusalem is ready to face the challenge . & ldquo ; We are continuing to build , across the city , for the benefit of all the community : Jews , Muslims , Christians , and more . & rdquo ; Lion also mentioned the plight of the hostage in front of some 70 of their family member who attended the event . & ldquo ; In Gaza , our brother and sister , men , woman , child and baby , are being held captive by the worst terrorist , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; We all pray to have them home with their family . & rdquo ; A GROUP of 70 relative attended the reception .

Lavi & rsquo ; s brother-in-law Omri Miran is being held in Gaza . & ldquo ; Every time I addressed an international body or foreign government official , I asked them to keep Hamas accountable , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; At the same time , I hold my government accountable . We know there is an Israeli proposal for an agreement on the table . On October 8 , we were promised that bringing the hostage home wa the most important short-term objective of the war because time wa of the essence . After that , we could tackle the challenge of destroying Hamas . & rdquo ; Lavi recounted the horror experienced by Omri , his sister Lishay , and his young niece Roni and Alma at Kibbutz Nahal Oz at the hand of the Hamas terrorist .

2021-11-09 10:59:48.560,jpost,"The Beersheba District Court on Tuesday sentenced Israeli Arye Schiff to nine month of community service for shooting and killing an Israeli-Arab that broke into his car last November , Walla reported . Schiff wa sentenced in a plea bargain over his role in killing Mohammad al-Atrash , who the defendant claimed had been trying to steal his car and that he therefore acted in self-defense . The plea bargain and sentencing follow his conviction in July , where the court rejected his claim of self-defense . In fact , the prosecution said security-camera footage of the incident showed that Schiff wa in no danger and wa not even in his car when the car thief arrived . The prosecution had originally sought a sentence of 4-6 year in prison , but the plea deal averted that , Walla reported . Dozens had come out to the courtroom to support Schiff , including Religious Zionist MK Itamar Ben-Gvir . & nbsp ; `` Aryeh Schiff should receive a medal , not be prosecuted & ndash ; and certainly not receive a sentence of community service or prison , `` Ben-Gvir said in response to the verdict . `` The ruling sends a message to the resident of the South that they must not defend themselves , or else they will face charge and imprisonment . The huge gap between the sentence and the long prison sentence the prosecution demanded show the racist treatment shown to Jews forced to defend themselves . `` Also coming out against the verdict & ndash ; saying that it wa too lenient & ndash ; wa Meretz MK Mossi Raz . `` The sentence given to Aryeh Schiff is an embarrassment , `` Raz said in a statement . & nbsp ; `` It 's important for everyone to feel safe in their own home , but we must never allow it to become normalized that citizen can take the life of others into their hand . I ca n't help but think that if Schiff wa an Arab , his punishment would have been far more severe . `` But others welcomed the verdict . `` After many long month of public struggle , we are glad public pressure succedded , `` the right-wing NGO Im Tirtzu said in a statement . `` There wa no need at all to convict Aryeh , but at least the judge understands well that a very clear message must be conveyed that a citizen is allowed to defend himself against criminal . It will take a long time to restore the Negev 's security , but at least Aryeh Schiff can have his life back . `` Clashes soon erupted outside the courtroom between Schiff 's supporter and local Bedouin resident , notably when Ben-Gvir arrived . As the MK came to the court , the Bedouin resident began shouting at him , calling him a racist . & nbsp ; Ben-Gvir replied that `` We came to support and say that Aryeh Schiff is the hero of Israel , and it is time to bring order to the South , `` adding that , `` if the Police had been a deterrent in the South , Schiff would not have had to shoot the burglar . `` Other member of the Israeli Right have voiced their support of Schiff in the past . & ldquo ; The indictment against you should not have been filed , and having been filed , it should be withdrawn , & rdquo ; then-public security minister Amir Ohana told Schiff in March . & ldquo ; As usual , and despite conventional thinking , the problem is not the law or the wording of the law , `` he said . `` The problem is those interpreting the law . They are giving the law a restrictive interpretation until it is effectively negated , `` which is generally how the issue of self-defense is treated . `` They give themselves the power to fill up or empty the substance of a law . & rdquo ; Yonah Jeremy Bob contributed to this report .",israeli sentenced to 9 month community service for killing arab

2021-06-08 21:49:01.217,jpost,"A Bulgarian prosecutor provided detailed evidence to the Bulgarian court handling Hezbollah & rsquo ; s involvement in the 2012 Burgas bus bombing which killed five Israelis and their Bulgarian-Muslim bus driver , but the court refused to accept it , The Jerusalem Post ha learned . & nbsp ; Despite an official court transcript of these detail and an appeal by the Israeli victim & rsquo ; lawyer Yaki Rand to convince the Bulgarian appeal court to issue conviction , including terrorism charge against Hezbollah , the Post also understands there is a high chance that Bulgaria & rsquo ; s judiciary is looking to put the case to bed . & nbsp ; Throughout the trial there wa a dispute about Bulgarian official allegedly trying to charge only the individual , while seeking to avoid angering Hezbollah by naming it in the case . & nbsp ; For year , Bulgarian prosecutor claimed that they had no evidence with which to tie the two defendant , who were eventually given life sentence in absentia , directly to Hezbollah and terrorism . & nbsp ; Yet , on September 17 , 2020 , after the full trial and conviction and only four day before the sentencing hearing , the prosecutor finally admitted on the record that there wa significant evidence on the issue . & nbsp ; The prosecutor proceeded to detail the evidence into the court record , but since the conviction had already been set , the Bulgarian trial court said it hand were tied and that it could not reopen the case to charge Hezbollah and add terrorism charge . & nbsp ; Rand ha asked the Bulgarian appeal court to order the case reopened in order to add the new charge raised by the prosecutor & rsquo ; late additional comment , but there are indication that the judiciary want to be done with the case . & nbsp ; It is highly unusual for prosecutor to raise new fact and charge post-conviction , and it is still unclear why the prosecutor did not raise the evidence during the trial itself . & nbsp ; The case shook Europe to it foundation for it audacity , but left the family of the victim and Israel partially unsatisfied because Hezbollah itself wa not formally indicted or convicted . & nbsp ; At a July 2019 anniversary ceremony for the victim , their family had demanded that Hezbollah itself be charged in the Bulgarian trial for committing an act of terrorism . & nbsp ; In his speech , Kobi Price , one of the family member , noted that , & ldquo ; three year ago & hellip ; four year after the attack , the criminal trial opened & hellip ; In the indictment & hellip ; only two attacker & rdquo ; were charged . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We , the mourning family , ask the Government of Bulgaria to rise above narrow political consideration and to add the terror organization Hezbollah to the indictment without delay , & rdquo ; said Price . & nbsp ; Price continued , & ldquo ; Without Hezbollah , there is no morality in the trial . Without Hezbollah , the trial is ineffective . Without Hezbollah , there is no justice for the murdered victim . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; He reiterated to the Post on Monday that it wa unclear how much deterrence or justice could be achieved against the attacker if Hezbollah a an organization is left untouched . & nbsp ; In January 2018 , the Post exclusively disclosed that the Bulgarian state prosecution had decided not to charge Hezbollah a an organization with involvement in the 2012 bomb attack at the Burgas airport . & nbsp ; Instead , the prosecutor indicted the two men allegedly involved in the attack a if they were terrorist or even regular criminal who acted without connection to an organization . The word & ldquo ; Hezbollah & rdquo ; doe not appear in the indictment . & nbsp ; In addition , the indictment did not mention standard terrorism offense such a & ldquo ; acting a part of a terrorist organization & rdquo ; or connecting the murder offense to terrorism , referring instead merely to disturbing public order . & nbsp ; Sources close to the case told the Post at the time that when the Bulgarian prosecutor wa confronted with these anomaly , he claimed that no one provided him with evidence demonstrating Hezbollah & rsquo ; s involvement . & nbsp ; This directly contradicted evidence that came to light immediately after the attack from Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov naming Hezbollah a the culprit . & nbsp ; In 2013 , Tsvetanov & rsquo ; s successor , Tsvetlin Yovchev , told reporter before a commemoration ceremony , & ldquo ; There are clear sign that say Hezbollah is behind the Burgas bombing . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Also in 2013 , then-Bulgarian foreign minister Nikolay Mladenov and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu both confirmed the solid evidence linking Hezbollah to the Burgas attack . & nbsp ; Bulgaria & rsquo ; s investigation into the Burgas bombing even led to the EU placing Hezbollah & rsquo ; s armed wing on it blacklist . & nbsp ; The ruling party in Bulgaria ha changed numerous time since 2012 with some observer saying politics ham-strung the trial . & nbsp ; Toby Dershowitz , senior vice president for government relation and Strategy at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , a nonpartisan think tank focused on national security , told the Post at the time of sentencing that & ldquo ; Bulgaria ha long known that Hezbollah wa behind this horrific attack and ha been clear about it . The fact that Bulgaria say it only ha a mechanism to prosecute individual , and not organization , should not permit Hezbollah to yet again murder with impunity . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Post previously reported that Bulgaria sent extradition order to Lebanon & rsquo ; s government regarding the two Hezbollah operative who were then charged with the act of terrorism . & nbsp ; The Lebanese-Australian Meliad Farah and Lebanese-Canadian Hassan El Hajj Hassan , who have been convicted of blowing up the tour bus in Burgas , Bulgaria , are believed to be in Lebanon . & nbsp ; There are also US court document from other terror and Hezbollah-related case which have confirmed that the two convicted men a well a the third attacker who died in the attack , French-Lebanese national Jacques Felipe Martin ( aka Mohammad Hassan el-Husseini ) , were connected to Hezbollah . & nbsp ; According to medium report , the two convicted murderer are alleged to have entered Bulgaria using false driver & rsquo ; license printed in Lebanon .

2024-06-09 11:12:36.050,jpost,"As a global innovation powerhouse , Israel is actively integrating cutting-edge artificial intelligence ( AI ) technology across all facet of society , recognizing the vital importance of these advancement . & ldquo ; AI will lead to unimaginable transformation at all level and impact every aspect of our life and the life of future generation . This is the next industrial revolution , & rdquo ; stated President Isaac Herzog.But doe this avant-garde spirit extend to the creative realm , where generative art offer a captivating glimpse into the fusion of human ingenuity and machine intelligence ? On the screen , digital dream come alive with lush vegetation , ephemeral flower , and flowing water.This is the AI-created world of & ldquo ; Botanic Reverie & rdquo ; by Ronen Tanchum , an Israeli artist working at the forefront of technology . & ldquo ; My aim is for audience to feel my artwork and engage with it on a deep emotional level , & rdquo ; say Ronen.Inspired by nature , he us generative algorithm to explore new aesthetic territory that exist on the boundary between the natural and the imagined . AI allows u to take a fresh look at familiar image , revealing unexpected facet of beauty . & ldquo ; My work pulsates with theme of synthetic nature , blooming phenomenon , and digital-human synchrony , exploring the human-machine-environment relationship , & rdquo ; Tanchum said.Contemporary artist are increasingly experimenting with generative technique , bringing their boldest creative idea to life . But how doe this art of the future work ? Algorithms trained on vast datasets can create image , video , and even music in response to textual prompt or visual example . Utilizing complex mathematical model , neural network identify pattern and generate content that aligns with user-defined parameter . Then , with additional command , human edit the generated image until the desired result is achieved . In this process , the artist becomes a kind of conductor , guiding the machine & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; creative & rdquo ; efforts.London-based Israeli photographer Ori Gersht demonstrates how AI can expand the expressive possibility of traditional medium in his project & ldquo ; Fields & amp ; Visions & amp ; ( Another World ) . & rdquo ; When processing his own photograph , the artist invite the neural network to reinterpret and literally & ldquo ; build upon & rdquo ; the original image & ndash ; now , they balance on the edge of photography and digital painting . & ldquo ; The combination of the precise trace of the optical lens in harmony with the computerized interpretation of artificial intelligence capture a shift in our concept of reality , a these photograph are no longer a faithful depiction of the physical subject matter , & rdquo ; comment Gersht.With this experiment , the artist transforms the very nature of photography , leading the viewer into a space of imagination.The ethical ramification of AI artOf course , it & rsquo ; s not so straightforward . In Israel , a around the world , there is an extensive public discussion surrounding generative art . It & rsquo ; s questionable whether it can be considered genuine art if a substantial portion of the work is done by a machine rather than a human.While diversity of approach and freedom of expression are hallmark of Israeli art & ndash ; just a they are of it society a a whole & ndash ; a majority of Israeli artist continue to work successfully with traditional fine art materials.Guy Yanai , an Israeli painter well-established on the international art scene , told The Jerusalem Post that he doe not use AI tool in his art . At the same time , he note that every industrial revolution ha a beneficial impact on the evolution of art , pushing the boundary of creative exploration and opening up new dimension of creativity.Experts also point out that generative art challenge the established understanding of the creative process and the very concept of an artwork . & ldquo ; I view generative art a a new method that may complement other contemporary a well a traditional practice , & rdquo ; Irena Gordon , chief curator of The Petah Tikva Museum said . & ldquo ; While it is exciting a a starting point , in the end it is up to the artist to use it to create good and meaningful art . & rdquo ; The integration of AI into the artistic sphere raise a number of important ethical and legal questions.Who is the author of a work created by an algorithm ? How do we assess the authenticity and value of such art ? Particularly heated discussion revolve around copyright for generative content and privacy issue when algorithm process personal data . Israel & rsquo ; s recently adopted & ldquo ; Responsible Innovation & rdquo ; policy for AI regulation , aimed at finding a balance between technological progress , ethical norm , and public interest , is intended to serve a a guide for the integration of AI , including in the creative industry . & ldquo ; The revolutionary impact of AI technology is yielding constant improvement in the quality of life for Israel & rsquo ; s citizen in countless field . However , along with the numerous benefit , there are also many risk . We must ensure that the human remains at the center of AI development , & rdquo ; said Innovation , Science and Technology Minister Ofir Akunis.However , it would be incorrect to claim that AI ha completely and suddenly taken over art in Israel . Rather , it ha complemented the extensive list of tool in the arsenal of contemporary artists.Digital art in Israel encompasses a wide range of technology , demonstrating the openness of local artist to innovation and experimentation , from 3D modeling , VR , and AR to generative graphic , animation , and more . These medium often intersect and overlap in the practice of artist , creating complex artistic statement in the language of contemporary techno-culture.This is the language in which Ruth Patir , representing Israel at this year & rsquo ; s Venice Biennale , also express herself . Her project & ldquo ; ( M ) otherland & rdquo ; masterfully combine documentary narrative with advanced computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) technology . In her work , the artist us 3D animation to convey her idea to a digital-age audience in a language most understandable to them . & ldquo ; For me , creating work that expand the vocabulary of the digital asset ha become something I wa really eager to fight for , & rdquo ; Patir said , noting , & ldquo ; My practice doesn & rsquo ; t focus on technology , it is only a facade of whatever is the contemporary moment we are living . & rdquo ; Creative experiment with technology are also resonating in the local art market . Galleries and collector , primarily of the younger generation , are showing increasing interest in new media.The first auction sale of NFT work by Israeli artist took place in 2022 at Tiroche auction in Herzliya , with lot selling for record amount for this segment , reaching the upper estimate . Sales of digital art on the secondary market indicate the successful integration of this genre into the commercial context.Leading cultural institution in Israel are gradually including generative art along with other digital art in their exhibition and educational program . However , it should be noted that these are still only tentative attempt , and truly large-scale exhibition project exploring the theme of AI are still ahead for Israelis.It is equally crucial to discus the challenge . Vladimir Opredelenov , a leading expert on digitalization for creative industry , warned The Jerusalem Post about the risk of falling behind technological progress : & ldquo ; Cultural institution need to change their mindset and implement innovative solution to avoid finding themselves in a kind of & lsquo ; blackout . & rsquo ; If they do not become part of the global digital ecosystem , they risk losing relevance and audience in the era of intelligent machine . Museums must actively study and apply AI technology in their work & ndash ; from curating and research to collection management and visitor engagement . & rdquo ; Moreover , the integration of AI into artistic practice requires art professional to continually improve their digital literacy and master new technological tools.To effectively leverage the capability of AI for creativity , analysis , curating , and audience engagement , employee of museum , gallery , and other cultural institution need to actively develop digital competency , and stay up-to-date with the latest technology trends.AI also open up previously unseen opportunity , particularly in the realm of preserving historical memory and cultural heritage . Algorithms can efficiently analyze vast amount of digitized archival data , systematize it , extract valuable information , and even aid in reconstructing lost artifacts.At Yad Vashem Museum , AI technology are used to process million of document , identify Holocaust victim , and create installation that immerse visitor in the context of historical event . & ldquo ; AI is not just another technological trend , it is a fundamental shift that will affect every aspect of our life , & rdquo ; Leading world expert in AI and co-founder of Navan Ilan Twig said . & ldquo ; This technology ha already firmly entered our life and will only develop further . It is important for the art community to embrace these change and learn to harness the potential of AI in the most productive way . & rdquo ;",when art meet ai : israel 's journey into generative art
2023-11-11 21:52:51.570,jpost,"CNN hired a photojournalist who just three day before posted video and photo of himself inside Israel during the Hamas massacre , including with an Israeli tank and a room of bloody , dead bodies.Gaza photojournalist Hassan Eslaiah crossed into Israel on October 7 to document the Hamas massacre of more than 1,200 Israelis . His photo from the scene appeared on several international news outlet , including The Associated Press , the Jerusalem-based watchdog HonestReporting revealed last week . & nbsp ; CNN had also hired Eslaiah.The watchdog & rsquo ; s story sparked a series of question and international outcry , ultimately leading to his being let go from the two institution . & nbsp ; However , CNN said in a statement last week that their working relationship with the freelancer began after the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel , on October 10 . It also noted that despite it decision to stop working with Eslaiah , it did not have & ldquo ; any reason to doubt the journalistic accuracy of the work he ha done for u , & rdquo ; a reported by Ynet and confirmed by The Jerusalem Post . & nbsp ; The Post confirmed that Eslaiah wa not fired for his work on the 7th but for a separate but related concern.It wa unclear if CNN knew about Eslaiah & rsquo ; s post on Telegram before offering him work . & nbsp ; CNN told the Post it will not be commenting further on the matter.Crossing the line : Did a photojournalist support the massacre of Israelis ? The issue go beyond issue of accuracy or bias but is more about the line that get crossed when a photojournalist appears to act with delight in response to witnessing the killing of civilian , while working for a major news outlet.HonestReporting showed a screenshot of a now-removed post of the photojournalist on X standing in front of the Israeli tank without a press vest or helmet . The tweet read , & ldquo ; Live from inside the Gaza Strip settlement . & rdquo ; A similar image still appears on his Telegram page.HonestReporting also published a separate image from well before the massacre showing Eslaiah buddying up with Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.However , by scrolling through Eslaiah & rsquo ; s personal Telegram channel , the Post ha found that Eslaiah posted much more than a tank on the 7th , including item that indicate that not only did he likely know about the planned massacre before it began at around 6:30 a.m . , but that he supported the death of the innocent Israelis he watched being murdered.Eslaiah & rsquo ; s first post on October 7 wa at 5:59 a.m . : & ldquo ; We wake up to the great gift of God , & rdquo ; he posted , according to a translation by ChatGPT . & ldquo ; The spirit ha returned , and our blessing have increased . & rdquo ; Within half an hour , he is posting about the rocket being launched at Israel and the sound of the Iron Dome intercepting them over Khan Yunis . Then , between 6:55 a.m . and 8:30 a.m . , he post multiple variation : & ldquo ; To follow the latest news moment by moment , follow me on my medium platform . & rdquo ; At 8:29 a.m . , he appears & ldquo ; live from inside the settlement near the Gaza Strip & rdquo ; with a picture of a burning tank in the background.At 8:36 a.m . , after witnessing nearly 10 minute of the massacre , he post image from the scene with a verse from the Koran : & ldquo ; And on that day , the believer will rejoice in the victory of Allah & rdquo ; and the hashtag & ldquo ; # AqsaFlood . & rdquo ; At 9:25 a.m . , the most gruesome of post is revealed : a video with his watermark : & ldquo ; Filmed by Hassan Eslaiah & rdquo ; in the center , depicting a room full of dead , bloody body . & nbsp ; This particular video doe not appear to have been published anywhere else .

2024-04-26 22:09:56.327,jpost,"Hanan Savyon and Guy Amir , the duo behind the TV series Asfur and the megahit Israeli movie Maktub and Forgiveness , are back on the small screen with Bros , Netflix & rsquo ; s first original Hebrew-language series , which recycles the Jerusalemite schlubby bromance shtick that ha worked for them all these years.If you liked their earlier work , you & rsquo ; ll have fun with this , and if you didn & rsquo ; t , well , you & rsquo ; re probably not their target audience anyway . For once , there are English subtitle available , which will make it easier for many English-speakers in Israel to give it a try . & nbsp ; It won & rsquo ; t shock anyone to hear that they play two friend who run a bar in the Mahaneh Yehuda market called Pin-Younis , with Savyon a the hard-partying Pini , whose wife can & rsquo ; t get pregnant ( which a doctor suggests is a problem caused by Pini & rsquo ; s drug use ) , and Amir a Niso , his BFF and business partner , whose girlfriend , Rotem ( Yael Sztulman ) , work at the bar.The main plot is about how they head to Krakow to support their favorite soccer team & ndash ; Beitar Jerusalem , a you might have guessed & ndash ; a it competes against a Polish team . Subplots include a possible cancer diagnosis , Niso & rsquo ; s problem with Rotem , and a group of Tel Aviv hipster who plan to open a rival establishment and then try to buy their bar . & nbsp ; Their Poland adventure take up several episode and allows them to delve a bit into the little-known history of how Mizrahim were victim in the Holocaust.The Poland episode also feature all kind of action , including when they get chased by a group of neo-Nazis and even more dire predicament . Like a lot of Israeli comedy , the series mix sentimental and melodramatic storyline with the slapstick . & nbsp ; One thought that occurred to me watching it is that while most Beitar fan are just fan , there is a racist element to the team & rsquo ; s fan base that you wouldn & rsquo ; t guess at from it portrayal here . The series doesn & rsquo ; t make it clear that the character distance themselves from the kind of fan who have actually unfurled & ldquo ; Forever Pure & rdquo ; banner at the team & rsquo ; s match & ndash ; & ldquo ; Forever Pure & rdquo ; is the title of an excellent documentary about these fan & ndash ; to show their opposition to the team hiring Arab player . These fan have resorted to violence to show their opposition to having Arabs and Muslims of all nationality join the team . & nbsp ; But the heart of the series is Pini and Niso & rsquo ; s friendship , and Savyon and Amir , who have been working together for decade , really project the closeness of longtime friend and , like so many comic actor , rise to the occasion when there is an emotional moment . Their self-deprecating likability lift this series above it often formulaic script , and if you stick with it , it will be because you enjoy spending time in their company . & nbsp ; What else is on Israeli TV ? IT & rsquo ; S GOOD news for fan of vintage American sitcom that Yes ha just started a new channel called Classic Comedies , which is available on Channel 29 . It run around the clock , and it offer comedy series from the & rsquo ; 70 to the & rsquo ; 90 . It feature All in the Family , which many consider the greatest sitcom of all time , which wa about the unrepentant racist Archie Bunker.This series wa created by television great Norman Lear , and wa more or less the first time that a network television comedy dealt with political issue for laugh , but with a serious agenda . Lear wa a liberal , and while the pugnacious hero , Bunker , charmed some , his conviction were proved wrong in episode after episode , although the series also made fun of his liberal son-in-law ( played by Rob Reiner , the son of Carl Reiner , who is now a movie director ) and his daughter ( Sally Struthers ) . Other sitcom on the channel include Mad About You , with Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt ( who went on to win a Best Actress Oscar for As Good As It Gets ) , Cheers ( considered one of the best ensemble cast of all time ) , Happy Days ( the Fonz ! ) , Who & rsquo ; s the Boss ? and The Love Boat.If Yes programmer are reading this , I & rsquo ; d like to request that they add The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Taxi , two series created by James L . Brooks that I would be very happy to see at 2 a.m . when I can & rsquo ; t sleep.ONE OF the big issue in the Hollywood writer strike wa the use of AI to write screenplay , because the Hollywood scribe feared they would be replaced . But when you watch a lot of the rom-coms and light entertainment on Netflix and other platform these day , it & rsquo ; s hard to believe that they weren & rsquo ; t written by robot , and not especially well-programmed robots.That doesn & rsquo ; t mean you won & rsquo ; t enjoy aspect of them ; the cast and location are always great-looking . But to say that there are no surprise would be an understatement . & nbsp ; A case in point is the new Spanish movie on Netflix , Love , Divided . It & rsquo ; s about a nerdy but gorgeous app designer who work out of his apartment , which share a paper-thin wall with the apartment that a recently dumped , awkward but gorgeous pianist move into . He ha a deadline to get the app ready and must work all the time , while she is practicing for a special audition.If you & rsquo ; ve seen a movie or two , you could easily write a script right now that would be almost identical to the actual film.LOOKING FOR something a little more interesting , I found I & rsquo ; ll See You in My Dreams , a movie that recently joined the Netflix lineup and which star Blythe Danner ( who is probably best known these day for being Gwyneth Paltrow & rsquo ; s mother , but who ha had a very interesting career of her own ) a Carol , a lonely widow who step back into the dating pool after many year alone . While it might sound like a typical rom-com , it & rsquo ; s much more thoughtful and even a bit downbeat.Carol , a retired singer and teacher and the mother of an adult daughter who life far away , wake up every morning , water her plant , exercise , see her girlfriend ( a great group played by Rhea Perlman , Mary Kay Place , and June Squibb ) , and play golf , but she feel something is missing in her life ; and after her beloved dog dy , she begin dating.Sam Elliott , who played the wise old cowboy in The Big Lebowski , is her love interest , and his character is similarly adrift.But the story isn & rsquo ; t all straight line and big laugh , ending with a clinch .

2024-06-07 03:19:30.437,jpost,"The Israel National Team will get back to action with a pair of soccer friendly against Hungary on Saturday and Belarus on Tuesday a brand-new head coach Ran Ben Shimon will get his first taste of leading the blue-and-white.Following a number of disappointing campaign under the leadership of Alon Hazan and Yossi Benayoun , the Israel Football Association decided to make a change and it brought in a battle-tested head coach , both in Israel and abroad , who also ha international soccer experience on his resume.The 53-year-old Ben Shimon grew up a a player in the Maccabi Petah Tikva youth system , where he featured between 1987-1995 . But it wa with Hapoel Haifa where the defender starred and captained the Carmel Reds to the 1999 league championship . The Petah Tikva native also played for the Israel National Team , making 34 appearance , before moving into coaching where he began to earn his stripe in the Maccabi Tel Aviv youth department in 2003.His first full time head coaching job wa with Kiryat Shmona , where he helped the team earn promotion from the Leumit League and then finished in third place in Premier Leauge action to earn a place in UEFA Cup play.After a very short stint with Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2008 it wa back to Kiryat Shmona for a trio of season where he won a pair of Toto Cups . Most notable a well a the shocking 2011-2012 League championship with K8 that became an international story of success for a small team finding a way to finish atop the table against club with budget much higher than the northerners.The next season , Ben Shimon went abroad to lead AEK Larnaca in Cyprus and then returned back to Israel to head up Hapoel Tel Aviv , Maccabi Petah Tikva and Beitar Jerusalem before taking over the Cyprus National Team post where he plied his trade between 2017-2020.Ashdod for three season and then another stop back at Larnaca wa on tap before being appointed a the head coach of the Israel National Team.Ahead of the two upcoming match , which for Hungary will be a tune-up for the UEFA European Championship , Ben Shimon wa unveiled a the new bench bos and spoke about his vision for the & nbsp ; blue-and-white a he begin to mold the squad to his liking . ' Israel National Team is a mission ' & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The Israel National Team is not just another stop for me & ndash ; it & rsquo ; s a mission , and I will go into every working day treating it a the most important day . & ldquo ; Being a national team player is how one conduct himself off and on the field , both when we are together a a team and when we are not . Every time we are together is of great importance to me . Every game will be treated the same , no more or no less important . & nbsp ; This is an opportunity for everyone who is around the team to ask what they can do differently . We are in a complex period of time and I will try my utmost to connect this team to the people of Israel . & rdquo ; Ben Shimon spoke about Barak Bachar , who had been a leading candidate for the position but decided to head back to Maccabi Haifa after a short and disappointing run with Red Star Belgrade . & ldquo ; Coaches who were deserving of this position were in competition for it and I don & rsquo ; t feel second to anyone , no matter what is written and what people may say . I wa also a candidate in other campaign , I feel very secure in my place . & ldquo ; Every place that I & rsquo ; ve been in my life there wa also a clash between my head and my heart and I went with my gut feeling . This is the right place for me to be . I believe in my ability to do different thing than what wa done in the past . I believe in this generation of player and I have arrived at the right stage in my life to coach the Israel National Team , which is a big challenge . I will have to bring all the experience and what I have gained in life into the challenge that I am entering into today with great faith . & rdquo ; Ben Shimon will lead the team in the upcoming Nations League campaign , where the opponent will be European heavyweight France , Italy and Belgium . & ldquo ; I am not going to deny that the main goal is Euro 2028 , but we will have a competitive team in every game . Each game will give u a little more a to what we can do and accomplish . & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m not going to pas up these two year . I & rsquo ; m going to work very hard to produce a DNA of winner and I need to create a team that will connect with the people in this campaign . We will not give up any game . That & rsquo ; s the beauty of sport & ndash ; you don & rsquo ; t know what the outcome will be at the end . We will come into these game with complete faith that we can win . & rdquo ; Ben Shimon added that he is still working to put together his group of assistant . & ldquo ; I believe that in the next week or so the balance of the staff will be appointed and if we only rely on the time we get together for game our philosophy won & rsquo ; t work . We have to work on a daily basis , work hard and convince the player that this is what it take to advance to a big tournament . & ldquo ; In order to achieve different result , we must change . My predecessor did good thing and we need to learn from that . I am a big believer in seeing what team similar to ours have done and those that have broken glass ceiling . I am coming into this with complete faith in both the local product and the Israeli player . & rdquo ; The new coach also spoke about what type of player that he will want to include in his squad a well a how he will work with them to get the best out of the squad . & ldquo ; I will have to shape the nature of my work in front of the player . I prefer player with European experience , but the team is open to everyone . & rdquo ; Last campaign saw the ugly saga of Eran Zahavi & rsquo ; s hotel room assignment , which caused a stir at the time . & ldquo ; Everyone come in with their own agenda , & rdquo ; Ben Shimon said . & ldquo ; We & rsquo ; ll sit down and decide how we want thing to look . I don & rsquo ; t think it & rsquo ; s too complicated , we need to create an environment for the player to succeed . I have a personal connection with each player . I have a wonderful relationship with Eran and I also spoke with [ Miguel ] Vitor . I believe that everything will be & nbsp ; considered individually , but there is no doubt that the team is going through a process . & rdquo ; Ben Shimon also commented on the path he took to become the head coach . & ldquo ; When I wa a player , I didn & rsquo ; t think I would become a coach . All the station I went through come back to me . While I am an emotional person , I am less concerned with the past and I am not very nostalgic . All this is nice , but from here on it is a matter of seeing what we can do to succeed . & rdquo ;",ben shimon stoked for blue-and-white debut

2021-04-08 21:07:15.657,jpost,"Can the US offer financial assistance to the Palestinians even while the Palestinian Authority pay monthly stipend to terrorist and their family ? & nbsp ; The question wa raised by reporter and pundit on Wednesday when the US announced it planned to restore humanitarian and security assistance to the Palestinians , a part of an overall financial package of $ 290 million . & nbsp ; Former US president Donald Trump cut all funding to the Palestinians , which had soared close to $ 600 million annually under the Obama administration . & nbsp ; Trump also put in place legislation to hold the PA financially accountable for terror activity and to halt it practice of terror stipend , known a & ldquo ; pay-for-slay . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; A reporter referenced that legislation when quizzing US State Department spokesman Ned Price on how the Biden administration could legally restore funding . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; US law & ndash ; there & rsquo ; s several of them & ndash ; say that the US can not provide money to the Palestinian Authority , & rdquo ; the reporter stated . & nbsp ; Price assured him that the funding wa & ldquo ; absolutely consistent with relevant US law . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Here are five thing to know about US funding to Palestinians and PA terror payment : & nbsp ; PA & rsquo ; s pay-for-slay The Palestinian Authority provides monthly stipend to the family of terrorist who are killed while engaging in act of terrorism , and to those jailed for terrorist act or on suspicion of terrorist activity . & nbsp ; It is estimated that the PA spends at least NIS 500 million annually on these stipend , with higher payment going to those whose crime were more severe and who have longer jail sentence . & nbsp ; Proponents of & ldquo ; pay-for-slay & rdquo ; brand the payment a a kind of social welfare system , particularly in light of Israel & rsquo ; s practice of administrative detention in which security prisoner can be held without charge . & nbsp ; Opponents have argued that if this were the case , payment would be based on need rather than the severity of the crime . & nbsp ; Taylor Force Act US military veteran Taylor Force wa stabbed to death in March 2016 , while in Israel for a business program , near the beach in Tel Aviv by a Palestinian . Two year later the US Congress passed legislation prohibiting direct assistance to the PA , to prevent terror payment based on US fund going to anyone associated with Force & rsquo ; s death . & nbsp ; The Biden administration intends to uphold that legislation , including not paying PA loan . & nbsp ; The Anti-Terror Clarification Act The anti-terror clarification act of 2018 allowed the Palestinian Authority to be financially liable should it be found guilty in US court of supporting terror activity . The legislation wa broadly written so that even humanitarian assistance to non-governmental Palestinian organization , peace-building funding or scholarship funding put the PA in a position of liability . & nbsp ; The PA notified the US in 2019 that it would not accept any funding , including humanitarian assistance , over fear of judicial liability . Subsequent Congressional legislation amended the ATCA to allow financial assistance to the Palestinian people , but leaving intact judicial liability issue for direct funding to the PA and the Palestine Liberation Organization . & nbsp ; PA Security Forces The US-trained Palestinian security force , which cooperate with the IDF , are considered an essential pillar of stability in the West Bank . Funding for those force , which had amounted to $ 60 million annually , wa exempt under the Taylor Force Act . & nbsp ; Joel Braunold , managing director of the S . Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace , said that the Taylor Force Act wa specifically intended to target the Economic Support Funds account that drew on & ldquo ; bilateral economic assistance and humanitarian traditional program in the West Bank and Gaza . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; But it wa not intended to & ldquo ; affect security assistance that come from the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement account ( INLE ) , not covered by Taylor Force requirement . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Funding for the security force , however , wa impacted by the ATCT , a problem corrected by amendment to that legislation . The Biden administration ha now resumed funding to the PA security force . & nbsp ; UNRWA The majority of US funding to the Palestinians had always gone through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugee , amounting to an annual grant of over $ 350 million . The US wa the single largest donor to UNRWA . & nbsp ; The Trump administration & rsquo ; s decision in 2018 to cut funding to UNRWA wa not based on prohibition in the ATCT or the Taylor Force Act . There wa no legal impediment to continued US funding to UNRWA , which service 5.7 million Palestinian refugee in east Jerusalem , Gaza , the West Bank , Lebanon , Jordan and Syria . & nbsp ; The Trump administration made a policy decision not to support the organization because it believed that Palestinians could be better served by other organization . It agreed with Israel that UNRWA & rsquo ; s definition of who is a Palestinian refugee wa problematic , and that the organization wa inefficient and promoted incitement against Israel . & nbsp ; The Biden administration ha now made a policy decision to support UNRWA , with an initial grant of $ 150 million .",5 thing to know about u funding to palestinian and terror payment
2023-10-22 15:44:16.360,jpost,"Israel should not re-occupy the Gaza Strip , and should make sure Palestinians still rule the area , Commanders for Israel & rsquo ; s Security ( CIS ) and other former top defense official said in it recommendation for how Israel should handle Gaza post-toppling Hamas.In contrast , several official familiar with government deliberation on the issue are far more circumspect about sharing their view , and about whether a serious strategy can be framed , before the outcome of the ground invasion ( which continues to be delayed ) becomes clearer.According to the senior former security official , & ldquo ; The war must end decisively for Israel , in a manner which will restore Israel & rsquo ; s standing and enhance deterrence . Towards this end , diplomatic , economic and other tool of statecraft should be pursued alongside the military campaign . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; Israel ha no intention of occupying the Gaza Strip and will not reassume responsibility for it . The Gaza Strip must be ruled by a Palestinian government with the assistance of international entity and a direct connection to the Palestinian government in the West Bank , & rdquo ; said CIS.Further , CIS said , & ldquo ; Israel should relinquish control of the territory captured during the operation a quickly a possible and should not repeat the scenario of becoming mired in the Lebanese quagmire . This imperative doe not include territory captured for the purpose of widening the buffer zone . & rdquo ; Questions about this new Palestinian regime in GazaCIS & rsquo ; s strategy paper is one of the most detailed to date on the issue by top official , though it still leaf many open question : What form will a new Palestinian regime in Gaza take ? How much will the Palestinian Authority dominate this regime versus local representative from Gaza ? Given Hamas & rsquo ; s success at eliminating organized internal opposition , how will Gaza have local representative if none of the class of Hamas , ruler for the last 15 year , will be allowed in the new regime ? & nbsp ; Also : Why will this new Palestinian government , with whatever unidentified international assistance , succeed in keeping Hamas down where the PA , UNFIL , and other international peacekeeping group have failed in the past to keep down determined local violent group ? Finally , CIS said to avoid the Israeli model of the early 1980s of interfering with who ran Lebanon , but suggested an unidentified larger security zone . This larger security zone idea is another large piece of what kept Israel mired deep in the & ldquo ; Lebanese quagmire & rdquo ; for almost another 20 years.A top former intelligence official separate from this group gave a wider number of potential choice of what could happen to Gaza post Hamas . & ldquo ; We need to take apart Hamas , and any future ruler of Gaza can not bring back the military power . All of Oslo wa based on the paradigm of demilitarization . We dropped this requirement for Hamas . We need to hand off Gaza to Egypt , or the Palestinian Authority , Jordan , or the UAE , & rdquo ; said the former top intelligence official.However , he added , & ldquo ; Maybe no one will want to take it . & rdquo ; Despite this dilemma , he stated , & ldquo ; that even in the worst case , it would take year for some other bad actor to achieve the militarization level of Hamas . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; Hamas had 15 year for it military buildup . And it is not just that we did not disrupt their militarization . [ Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu even helped Hamas with funding and material . The material were for building , but they were used for making rocket and tunnel . It doe not matter who rule Gaza , we can not let them rebuild their military power . & rdquo ; This official wa possibly being the most blatantly honest of all , recognizing that there may be no perfect solution that can prevent Hamas from at some point regaining control of Gaza.However , he recognized that even if Hamas returned in the worst case scenario , this & nbsp ; would take time , and he wa pointing out that that time itself and extra time afterward to rebuild military power , would give a much longer break from large round of fighting with Gaza.Former national security council chief from 2017-2021 Meir Ben Shabbat said using overwhelming force against Hamas to defeat it quickly and comprehensively is the only thing Israel should be thinking about at this stage . & ldquo ; Israel is exempt from worrying what will happen in Gaza after the war . It must overthrow Hamas and destroy it military capability , and let the chip fall where they may , & rdquo ; said Ben Shabbat , who now also head Misgav : The Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy.Ben Shabbat appears to be concerned that the invasion itself continues to be delayed and to look more surgical and less aggressive than Netanyahu and other official & rsquo ; public statement would suggest.Regarding the multiple official familiar with government debate on the issue , one noted that Israel may not have a dominant role in deciding who to hand Gaza to , even if it militarily defeat the Gaza group.In other word , once Israel refuse to hold on to Gaza itself , and asks for international help , Jerusalem may be stuck with arrangement sponsored by the UN , the US , or some other mix of powers.Others implied that the invasion itself wa so large , and the guerilla war afterward so unclear and vague , that it wa nearly impossible to plan post-war issue until the shape of the war itself eventually becomes clearer . & nbsp ;",gaza must be ruled by palestinian with int ' l help - ex-defense chief

The exhibit wa a large , realistic painting called The Bureaucrat by Matan Ben Cnaan . It show a group of people in a field in Israel looking pleadingly at a man with a clipboard . The artist said he copied it & ndash ; the grouping , the face , the tense body language & ndash ; from a photo of prisoner arriving on the platform at Auschwitz.There wa a panel at the event , and they had an interesting commentary about it . They seemed to have thought a bit about the same idea the painting had raised for me : What would I have done if I had lived during the Holocaust ? How would I have protected my son Oren , who is in his 20 and ha autism ? & nbsp ; The audience listened intently a they [ the panel member ] spoke . It wa such a Jerusalem evening , with those old couple I see at all kind of exhibition and event . I used to hate and envy them , especially when I would overhear them talking about their adult child who were finishing the army and going to medical school or opening hi-tech business and getting married and having child . I don & rsquo ; t hate them anymore . It & rsquo ; s harder to hate them when they & rsquo ; re wearing corona mask . They look scared and creepy and childlike all at once.But it & rsquo ; s not only that . I don & rsquo ; t hate them anymore because thing are different with Oren now . & nbsp ; When the opening wa over , I tried to head to the outdoor sculpture garden to wander for a few minute in the cool air , but it wa blocked off . Oren used to like going to the museum and walking in that garden before we slipped into our routine of the zoo every Saturday afternoon . & nbsp ; THE LAST time I remember taking him to the museum wa during the summer he turned 18 , one of our hardest time . My mother , who had become too demented to live on her own in New York , had moved in with u . I couldn & rsquo ; t work a much a I had been because I wa taking care of her part of the time , and to write at all , I had to hire someone to look after her & ndash ; in addition to the student I hired to help me take care of Oren in the evening , when he often had tantrum . & nbsp ; So my income wa down , my expense were up , and my mother & rsquo ; s pension and saving were stuck in America and I had no one to help me get them out . The customer service employee on the phone line would hear the desperation in my voice and put me in the automatic scammer category , denying me access to every account she had . & nbsp ; My ex-husband had always said he would help care for my mother when the time came , but now he wa long gone . My mother , angry that I had whisked her away from her beloved New York , wa sitting on the couch all day , criticizing me , a mother do . I had to do all my work and any exercising in my bedroom . & nbsp ; We had just gone through a war with Gaza that had included missile fired at Jerusalem . It had thrown Oren & rsquo ; s school schedule out of whack ; now it wa the end of the summer and he wa home for 14 indescribably long day . When his repetitive question began to bother my mother , she would start yelling at him . I could not leave them alone in the living room , even to go to the bathroom . He didn & rsquo ; t react right away but later in the day , he would have violent tantrum , usually when I told him it wa time for him to stop playing on the computer . & nbsp ; But that wa n't the worst of itBUT THAT wasn & rsquo ; t the worst of it . The worst of it wa that I had stopped sleeping . & nbsp ; All right , that & rsquo ; s an exaggeration . I slept a little , but never more than four hour a night and usually much less . I had a sleeping-pill prescription at one point , but my doctor said it wa too much , I needed to stop , and he wouldn & rsquo ; t renew it . & nbsp ; He didn & rsquo ; t understand , though . My father had been bipolar , and I knew how it wa when someone stopped sleeping & ndash ; the sloppiness and the craziness that came out . I could feel myself heading that way . & nbsp ; The day we went to the Israel Museum back then , my mother wa home watching tennis with my younger son , Ben . It wa okay to leave them together , and I hoped my mother would never lose it with him the way she did with Oren . Ben wa affected by Oren & rsquo ; s tantrum more than any of u , I felt . Oren wa my son ; a his mother , I had signed on for this , for better or worse . But Ben had never asked for any of this , and a Oren & rsquo ; s outburst had gotten worse , Ben had gotten more and more withdrawn and rarely came out of his room . & nbsp ; Oren and I walked through the sculpture garden that summer day and stopped outside the child & rsquo ; s wing . The guard are real tough ass there , and Oren & rsquo ; s loud voice and jumping would instantly get him thrown out of any other part of the museum . He climbed the structure outside that kid were allowed to climb , a kind of pyramid that he lowered himself down into until only his long foot were visible.Being upside down like that seemed to calm him , and he wa quiet a we walked into the child & rsquo ; s wing , where a film about city wa showing , called Dies Irae . The room where it wa playing wa cool and empty , and we sat down . I had to Google dy irae to find out that it mean & ldquo ; day of rage . & rdquo ; The film showed rapidly shifting cityscape , and Oren and I were both transfixed . & nbsp ; I had brought a book with me to read during any kid & rsquo ; movie we might see there . It cheer me even now to remember that I wa actually reading a book then . How could I ever have found the time and energy ? & nbsp ; But it wa the perfect book for me right then : The Financial Lives of the Poets by Jess Walter . It wa a novel about an unemployed journalist who made disastrous real estate and career decision and briefly tried to deal weed to help him out of the mess he wa in , while coping with a cheating wife and a live-in , senile father . A different story from mine , but we shared a few thing & ndash ; including insomnia . & nbsp ; AT ONE point in the story , the hero read an article about chronic insomnia which said that it cause & ldquo ; & lsquo ; a steep decline in neural activity which can eventually lead to severe hallucination , delirium , mania , even psychotic break & ndash ; then death & ndash ; & rsquo ; Then death ? Wait . Just like that ? Shit . . . A few day without sleep and you go from slurred speech and bad decision to . . . death ? Well , that hardly seems fair . It feel like they left out a few step . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; I had seen the psychotic break of my own father and I knew I wa slipping , slipping . God , I shouldn & rsquo ; t have been driving at that time . It & rsquo ; s funny that they can test your alcohol level but not the fact that you haven & rsquo ; t had a good night & rsquo ; s sleep in month . & ldquo ; Empire State Building , & rdquo ; said Oren a an image of New York flashed on the screen . He had lived in New York until he wa four and wa still crazy about the subway and big building , which he looked at on YouTube video . I had not been able to bring him back for a visit in year , his behavior being too erratic , but his love for the city wa strong . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The Chrysler Building , & rdquo ; he added a moment later . & nbsp ; A few month earlier , when my friend & rsquo ; kid in the US were graduating from high school and my Israeli friend & rsquo ; kid were joining the army , Oren & rsquo ; s father and I had gone to family court to become his legal guardian . That & rsquo ; s what you will eventually have to do when you have a special-needs kid after he turn 18.The school sent home the initial paperwork , and a government representative came to the school to do back-to-back interview with parent and the kid & ndash ; just a formality . Eventually , we had to go to the court building without Oren and do some final paperwork . A few week later , the document showing we were now his guardian arrived in the mail . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The Statue of Liberty , & rdquo ; Oren said , and my mind reeled with gratitude to the filmmaker and curator & ndash ; that they had come up with something that Oren found absorbing . & nbsp ; The day before we visited the museum , The New York Times had run a magazine story on what they claimed were the nearly 10 % of people diagnosed with autism who & ldquo ; lose their diagnosis & rdquo ; and become completely mainstreamed , usually a a result of a kind of behavioral therapy that had left Oren in worse shape than before he started it . People kept emailing this article to me . & nbsp ; I have forgotten almost everything about the Dies Irae film , but it must have been a masterpiece because it made me forget about my mother and all of my other problem & ndash ; for a long a 20 second at a time . At the end of the film , a quote from the Requiem Mass appeared on screen , and I scrawled it down on the back page of The Financial Lives of the Poets : Remember that I am the cause of your journey ; Do not lose me on that day.The most relaxing place in IsraelWE WALKED out of the child & rsquo ; s wing . Oren asked to go home , but I couldn & rsquo ; t face the nightly routine yet , with all the possibility for tantrum and outburst from my mother , so I suggested walking a little more in the sculpture garden and , to my surprise , he agreed . & nbsp ; It can be the most relaxing place in Israel . Wherever you turn , there is another cluster of tree and another sculpture , and it seems a if you will never come to the end of it . We saw a small white entrance to a boxy structure . I assumed it would be filled with the kind of heavy abstract modern sculpture that I don & rsquo ; t have patience for . But we walked in anyway . & nbsp ; It wa a small white marble room , ringed with bench . There wa a square opening at the top , and when I looked up at it , I wa blinded by the glare of the sun high in the sky . Oren walked across the empty space , sat down on the bench , and tilted his head back . I followed and sat down next to him a he put his foot on the bench and stretched out his long leg . I glanced around to see if there wa a sign forbidding this & ndash ; we had been kicked out of so many other spot around the museum before . But there wa nothing.I followed his gaze upward and saw that from the side we were on , the square framed a perfectly blue piece of sky , dotted with white wisp . This description doesn & rsquo ; t do justice to the purity of the image . It wa a brilliant exhibit , and there wa no way you could look at it without being entranced by the beauty of the sky . I glanced at Oren lying there , so sweet and relaxed , and I stretched out myself , my head next to his , looking into that patch of blue & ndash ; and we drifted off to sleep . & nbsp ; We were suddenly awakened by a large and stern guard . I sat up instantly , feeling startled but unusually rested . The problem wasn & rsquo ; t that we had our leg on the bench ; it wa that the museum wa closing . & nbsp ; Oren understood and wa ready to leave . & nbsp ; We walked slowly along the gravel path with the other straggler . & nbsp ; As I looked at Oren walking alongside the reflecting pool just outside the exit , the sun glittered on the water and I saw that I had not lost him & ndash ; and that I would never lose him . & nbsp ; ",‘ dy irae ’ - a short story

All the great Jewish leader were all warrior , & rdquo ; said Liberman . & ldquo ; You do not care at all about the Torah , there is nothing Jewish about this . All this to me is how this draft dodging is anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist . We lost a full brigade & ndash ; killed , injured . The security situation requires an increase in the manpower of the IDF . Evasion of everything , military or civilian service & ndash ; this is the most anti-Jewish thing . & rdquo ; Security Committee Chairman MK Yuli Edelstein said that a Israel faced complex challenge , it wa part of the political leadership & rsquo ; s job to provide an accurate response to the security need of the nation.This is a historical turning point for the people of Israel . It is necessary and we have no other choice .

Ultra-orthodox youth would be offered alternative enlistment route with the national emergency and rescue service , or a shortened three month or three week service . This would circumvent combat role , which require several more month of training for qualification.The bill also introduced escalating consequence for religious school that did not comply with enlistment quota and regulation , with a 20 % decrease in government funding that would grow with consecutive year of violations.The law went through first reading during Lapid & rsquo ; s tenure in a shared administration with then-alternate prime minister Naftali Bennett , but opposition member argued that the October 7 massacre had changed the Israeli paradigm and the legislation wa obsolete.Coalition member also changed their position on the legislation , with MKs like Degel HaTorah leader Moshe Gafni arguing in the Budget Committee on Sunday that the opposition only sought to topple the government after the withdrawal of the National Unity party from the wartime emergency government and the coalition faced a March High Court interim order over military exemption for ultra-orthodox men in the wake of the April legislation deadline and a July 2023 draft law expiration . & nbsp ;",gallant applauded a he vote against his coalition 's haredi draft law

2023-01-05 16:28:33.750,jpost,"Gaza 's Health Ministry accused Israel on Thursday of delaying the entry of several X-ray machine needed to treat patient in the blockaded Palestinian territory.The ministry , run by the Gaza Strip 's ruling terrorist group Hamas , said request in the past 14 month for eight different type of X-ray machine and spare part to repair existing equipment had been rejected or delayed.Dozens of other X-ray machine were allowed into the impoverished Strip during the same period.Israel , which together with Egypt maintains a blockade around Gaza citing security concern , say it is worried about militant group commandeering such machine for military purposes.Palestinian Health Ministry director Medhat Abbas said the equipment wa funded by international relief and medical institution on behalf of hospital in Gaza . `` Holding back the entry of that equipment caused a delay in providing medical service to thousand of patient , `` Abbas told Reuters.Conflicting accountsResponding to his remark , Israel 's military-run Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories ( COGAT ) & nbsp ; accused Hamas and other militant group of `` systematically and cynically taking advantage of humanitarian and civilian shipment of equipment and good for terrorist purpose . `` Requests for such equipment , COGAT told Reuters , are examined on a case-by-case basis.Abbas said Israeli assertion about the medical equipment having dual us were a lie.At Gaza City 's Shifa hospital , Nalat Zeino , 51 , said she had been waiting 45 day to have an X-ray done for her kidney .

2021-06-17 22:06:23.200,jpost,"& nbsp ; Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu oversaw some of the most virulent instance of diplomatic warfare against Israel since the & ldquo ; Zionism equal racism & rdquo ; battle at the United Nations in the last century . & nbsp ; The Israeli-Palestinian and the larger Israeli-Arab conflict have long fueled attempt to turn the Jewish state into a pariah nation . & nbsp ; The stake were raised , however , because of the 2012 vote in the UN General Assembly that upgraded the status of the Palestinians to that of a non-member state . The Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s newfound status a a de facto UN state gave it a more expansive toolbox by which to pursue Israel and force it to execute a civilian and military withdrawal to the pre-1967 line . & nbsp ; At issue , however , wa not just Israel & rsquo ; s hold on the West Bank , east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights . The initiative also took aim at Israel & rsquo ; s Jewish identity , Jewish tie to it holy site , and it right to self-defense . & nbsp ; Netanyahu offset some of that impact by linking some of the attack with antisemitism and anti-Israel bias . He wa more effective than past premier in enlisting American support and in securing a circle of European , African and Asian ally . Issues of Palestinian incitement and support for terror also gained prominence during his tenure . & nbsp ; Here is a list of 12 victory and loss during his 12-year prime ministerial reign that began in March 2009 and ended this week . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Losses & nbsp ; 1 ) ICC open war crime probe against Israel & nbsp ; Israelis were not in danger of war crime suit at the ICC when Netanyahu entered office . & nbsp ; The accession of the PA to the Rome Statute in 2015 changed that , and allowed the PA to request a war crime probe into Israeli action in the West Bank , Gaza and east Jerusalem . & nbsp ; The ICC ruled this year that it had jurisdiction to hear war crime case connected with that territory , and ha opened a probe . While it is examining the possibility of war crime case against Israelis and Palestinians , it is presumed that the focus will be on potential Israeli war crime . & nbsp ; Should the ICC conclude that a probe could be conducted , then individual Israelis , most likely it leader , could find themselves facing war crime charge . & nbsp ; 2 ) UNHRC creates permanent probe against Israel & nbsp ; The UNHRC during Netanyahu & rsquo ; s tenure launched at least six fact-finding mission against Israel in an attempt to prove it had committed and continued to commit war crime and serious human right violation . & nbsp ; The most infamous wa the initial probe headed by and named for South African jurist Richard Goldstone . & nbsp ; The Goldstone mission and two others explored potential Israeli war crime during the three Gaza war . One of the fact-finding mission probed alleged human right abuse connected to West Bank settlement . The mission on the Hamas-led March of Return led to the creation of a database of IDF soldier who potentially executed war crime against the Palestinian participant . & nbsp ; This year the UNHRC created a permanent probe into potential Israeli human right abuse , both within sovereign Israel and in the West Bank and Gaza , starting from April 13 , 2021 . Israel is the only country under permanent investigation for war crime . & nbsp ; Separately it published a blacklist of company doing business with Israeli entity located over the pre-1967 line . It & rsquo ; s the only country against whom such a blacklist ha been published . & nbsp ; In 2018 it also began issuing an annual call for an arm embargo against Israel . & nbsp ; 3 ) UNESCO register Tomb of the Patriarchs to Palestine & nbsp ; UNESCO became the first UN body to recognize Palestine a a state , in 2011 . PA membership at UNESCO allowed the registration of three site onto it World Heritage List : the Church of the Nativity , the Battir terrace and the Tomb of the Patriarchs . The registration focused primarily on the period when the Tomb wa under Mamluk control in 1250 and through the Ottoman Empire period , rather than on the ancient and Biblical period when it wa in Jewish hand . & nbsp ; Israel withdrew from UNESCO in 2018 to protest it anti-Israel bias , after halting it annual payment to the organization in 2011 and losing it voting right two year later . & nbsp ; 4 ) EU product labeling & nbsp ; The European Union published guideline in 2015 on how to place consumer label on product from east Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza , to clarify that they were not produced in Israel . & nbsp ; The guideline were voluntary . Four year later , however , the EU Court of Justice ruled that all Israeli product produced over the pre-1967 line must be marked with such consumer label . & nbsp ; 5 ) UN launch apartheid investigation & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination this year ceded to a request by the Palestinian Authority to investigate whether Israel had committed act of apartheid . It would mark the first such UN investigation into such a charge based on the definition set out in the Rome Statute . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Victories & nbsp ; 1 ) Abraham Accords put a damper on BDS & nbsp ; The Abraham Accords , which normalized tie between Israel and four Arab country , took some of the wind out of the sail of the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement . The willingness of Arab country to do business with Israel made it more difficult for BDS to argue that other country should boycott it . & nbsp ; 2 ) ICC Mavi Marmara war crime probe nixed & nbsp ; The International Criminal Court chief prosecutor rejected a request to probe Israel for war crime relating to the IDF raid in 2010 against the Gaza-bound flotilla ship Mavi Marmara . The IDF forcibly boarded the ship a it attempted to break Israel & rsquo ; s maritime blockade of Gaza . During the raid , 10 Turkish activist aboard the ship were killed . & nbsp ; 3 ) Only one UNSC anti-Israel resolution passed & nbsp ; The UN Security Council condemned Israel only once during Netanyahu & rsquo ; s tenure , which is a record in the institution & rsquo ; s treatment of Israel . It wa the direct result of Netanyahu & rsquo ; s ability to secure opposition to such resolution from former US president Barack Obama and Donald Trump . The only exception wa in 2016 , in the final week of the Obama administration , when the UNSC approved Resolution 2334 that condemned Israeli settlement activity and rejected Israeli sovereignty over any part of east Jerusalem , including the Western Wall . & nbsp ; 4 ) Partial victory on the Jerusalem resolution & nbsp ; The PA pushed for the UN to ignore Jewish tie to the Temple Mount by referencing that site and the Western Wall solely by their Muslim name of Al-Haram Al-Sharif and the Buraq Plaza . With the support of Arab state , it began to insert Muslim-only reference in resolution on Jerusalem passed by the UNESCO Executive Board at each of it bi-annual meeting . Those text also disavowed Jewish sovereignty over Jerusalem . & nbsp ; The Jerusalem resolution were neutralized at UNESCO through a compromise in which the controversial element of the text were placed in an annex . The PA ha been more successful with a similar drive at the General Assembly , where it ha an automatic majority of support . & nbsp ; 5 ) Agenda Item 7 boycott & nbsp ; Netanyahu made no headway in swaying the UN Human Rights Council to rescind it mandate that the 47-member body discusses alleged Israeli human right abuse against the Palestinians at every one of it session under Agenda Item 7 . & nbsp ; But it successfully swayed European country that the existence of such a mandate against only one country wa an example of anti-Israel bias . As a result , most of the European country boycott Agenda Item 7 session , which take place three time a year . & nbsp ; 6 ) Spotlight on Pay-for-Slay & nbsp ; Netanyahu made significant inroad in persuading European and Western country , particularly the United States , to take the Palestinian Authority to task for providing monthly stipend to Palestinian terrorist and their relative . Israel ha dubbed the practice & ldquo ; pay-for-slay . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The US took a strong stand on the issue , with Congress passing the Taylor Force Act that prohibits direct economic assistance to the PA until it halt the payment . & nbsp ; 7 ) Condemnation of UNRWA incitement & nbsp ; Netanyahu also succeeded in generating awareness of UNRWA & rsquo ; s failure to ensure that it textbook did not include inciting material against Jews and Israel . & nbsp ; The Biden administration ha promised to link future funding to UNRWA to it adherence to a zero-tolerance policy for material that promotes hate and antisemitism against Jews and Israel . & nbsp ; The EU Parliament this year also condemned any use by UNRWA of such material .",netanyahu ’ s diplomatic warfare with the palestinian : 12 high and low

All these country depend on a strong America , & rdquo ; Friedman said.He also spoke to the Biden administration & rsquo ; s attempt to revive the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action . The plan , otherwise known a the Iran nuclear deal , wasdesigned to limit Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear capacity and wa signed between Tehran and six world powers.The former Trump administration exited the deal and the Biden administration ha sought to revive it , but third-party talk held in Vienna have stalled.In the interim , Iran ha advanced toward the production of a nuclear weapon , a move that diplomat and pundit have speculated could soon render the idea of reviving the JCPOA irrelevant.Friedman said the Biden administration had to be on only one of two path ; it could halt Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program through maximum sanction and covert action , or it could engage in talk with regard to a new deal that would replace the JCPOA.But this gray area , in which there wa an absence of diplomacy and maximum pressure , wa not applied and wa unsustainable .

2024-06-03 02:27:10.327,jpost,"& lsquo ; I wanted to express the very bizarre and extreme reality of these trip , what it & rsquo ; s really like to be there at that age , & rdquo ; said Asaf Saban , the writer/director of Delegation , a new feature film that opened on Thursday and look at teen on a high-school class trip to Poland , where they visit death camp & ndash ; a quintessentially Israeli rite of passage.Saban knew that making a dramatic film about the reality of such trip , rather than the ideal , would not be easy . But he ha created a thoughtful , compelling film , well-written and well acted , that illuminates the complexity of one of these trip in the & rsquo ; 90 . & nbsp ; It neither sentimentalizes the character & rsquo ; emotion nor condemns the teen for just being teen . He did that through creating several quirky , relatable character , among them Frisch ( Yoav Bavly , ) a sensitive guy , who ha a crush on Nitzan ( Naomi Harari , ) an ostensibly relaxed , confident girl.But Nitzan is more troubled than she seems , and the trip brings out strange emotion in her , which cause her to take an action on one of the concentration camp tour that is very human but obviously wrong . Ido ( Leib Levin ) is a brash extrovert focused on usual teen concern like girl and drinking , and doesn & rsquo ; t suddenly become an altruist in Poland.Delegation spotlight how there is some manipulation built into these trip , a the teen have group discussion in which they are encouraged to show emotion , the more intense the better . The difficulty created by this are illustrated by the character of Yosef ( Ezra Dagan , in a heartrending performance , ) and Frisch & rsquo ; s grandfather . He is a survivor who accompanies the class . & nbsp ; As the grandfather begin telling his personal story to the group , he speaks charmingly and engagingly about his life and experience a a child before his family wa deported . But it & rsquo ; s rambling , contains a great deal of personal detail , and isn & rsquo ; t what the group leader ( Alma Dishy ) want to hear . She is portrayed not a a villain but a a cog in a system designed to elicit a particular set of reaction : tear at the horror and pride in the State of Israel . & nbsp ; In one of the film & rsquo ; s most moving scene , she take the survivor aside and he admits that he know he hasn & rsquo ; t been saying what the student need to hear . & ldquo ; I get it . You want me to get to the action more quickly , & rdquo ; he say . As the film go on , he is overwhelmed by emotion and can & rsquo ; t & ldquo ; get to the action . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Prize winningIt 's not surprising that Saban & rsquo ; s complex , multi-layered script won the Anat Pirchi Best Screenplay Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival last year , or that his cast took the Best Ensemble Award there . And it & rsquo ; s particularly heartening that the film received recognition in Poland , where it won a special award at the Warsaw Film Festival . & nbsp ; The film wa inspired by Saban & rsquo ; s own experience on such a trip year ago . & ldquo ; It wa the first time I wa abroad without my parent . That & rsquo ; s an important detail , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; There is something festive about being abroad . I remember the excitement and my wish , and I think this is characteristic of young people that age , regardless , whether they are Israeli or not , whether it is a Holocaust trip or not , to experience something great . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The reality for me is that I remember the trip in fragment , and I remember feeling that I didn & rsquo ; t respond in the way I wa meant to . I don & rsquo ; t remember much about the historical site . I have many meaningless memory of small moment . I think this is what characterizes u a human being , the gap between the expectation and what we really take away from the experience . & rdquo ; He said he wasn & rsquo ; t interested in debating whether the trip are worthwhile or questioning the motivation of the student who take them . & ldquo ; Before you place a lot of political and sociological interpretation on them , the reality of these trip is that they are a very extreme and weird experience . & ldquo ; As weird a they are , these trip are the ultimate normative experience for Israeli teen . It & rsquo ; s a dissonance that is fascinating for me , because it say a lot . I wanted to look at it and give more weight to the subtext . People go into this territory with a lot of expectation and preconceived opinion that are all expressed with an exclamation point . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; For me , it wa very important to speak quietly , with sensitivity and to direct the viewer & rsquo ; s glance to the nuance and ask question , and not necessarily give answer . I wanted to replace the exclamation point with question mark . & rdquo ; He always kept in mind the importance of the reality of the Holocaust and to treat it with respect , not to exploit it for drama . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s something that I a a filmmaker am very sensitive to , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s an ethical question . How do you create a drama in such place [ where the Holocaust took place ] ? You can manipulate the viewer emotionally , by using imagery and using the Holocaust a a drama in the background to elicit emotion , in way that are too easy . And the dilemma I felt a a filmmaker mirror what the student go through there . & rdquo ; Saban made a point of creating & ldquo ; very typical character , who are dealing with small , ordinary problem . My challenge wa to shift the attention to the detail and dynamic among these character in the present , when in the background you have the greatest drama , not just in Jewish history , but in the history of humanity . & rdquo ; Speaking about the character of the grandfather who is not encouraged to express his story fully and in depth , he said , & ldquo ; I think he want to succeed . He want to perform his role in the way that is expected of him . He ha the will to do it , but not the ability . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Saban said that the toughest task for him wa to put aside his perspective a an adult and recapture the feeling of what it wa like to be in Poland and at the death camp at age 17 . & nbsp ; But with Yosef , he allowed himself to look at the experience with the eye of a more mature person . & ldquo ; There is a similarity between how I wanted to tell the story of the student in the film and how Yosef want to tell his story . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; When a sheepish Yosef admits to the teacher that he know he isn & rsquo ; t getting to & ldquo ; the action & rdquo ; & ndash ; the horror & ndash ; quickly enough and will try to do better , that sentence express something that Saban wa also grappling with . & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m also saying to the viewer , you come to this with expectation , but maybe you won & rsquo ; t get the action in the place you expect , at the volume that you & rsquo ; re expecting to hear . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; With the character of Yosef , he is the storyteller , but he isn & rsquo ; t the storyteller you expect . The fact that he fails and can & rsquo ; t finish his task in the way that is expected of him & ndash ; that is the deepest and truest proof of his authenticity , of the authenticity of his experience and his feeling . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I think that & rsquo ; s life . People like Anne Frank and Etty Hillesum succeeded in expressing their humanity in the context of their personal experience , and that & rsquo ; s what creates the drama of their story . That & rsquo ; s why you remember them . & rdquo ;",israeli director tackle film about a class trip to poland
2024-06-05 03:43:14.223,jpost,"( JTA ) - The musician Jonny Greenwood wa pushing back on critic who said he should abandon a plan to tour with an Israeli collaborator because of the Israel-Hamas war.Greenwood and Dudu Tassa , an Israeli rock star from a prominent Mizrahi musical family , were scheduled to perform together on the European festival circuit this summer , a year after they released a joint record that featured singer from across the Middle East . Some of the date were rescheduled after the pair canceled show in the immediate wake of Hamas & rsquo ; October 7 attack on Israel.The performance are drawing criticism amid widespread anti-Israel sentiment in the art and in Europe , and Greenwood ha faced call to cancel.In a statement posted to social medium on Tuesday , he said he would do no such thing - and said that call to silence Israeli artist are counterproductive . & ldquo ; Others choose to believe this kind of project is unjustifiable and are urging the silence of this - or any - artistic effort made by Israeli Jews , & rdquo ; Greenwood wrote . & ldquo ; But I can & rsquo ; t join that call : The silencing of Israeli film makers/musicians/dancers when their work tour abroad - especially when it & rsquo ; s at the urging of their fellow western filmmakers/musicians/artists - feel unprogressive to me , not least because these people that are invariably the most progressive member of any society . & rdquo ; Greenwood & rsquo ; s relationship to Israel is long . He is married to Israeli visual artist Sharona Katan , who ha said the family identifies a Jewish , and recorded guitar on album by Tassa and fellow Israeli Shye Ben Tzur before making the album with Tassa . Both artist opened for Radiohead on some tour date in 2017.Music unites against boycottsTassa is the grandson of Daoud Al-Kuwaity , one of the most famous Iraqi composer of the 20th century who emigrated to Israel in 1951 . In his statement , Greenwood note that the song of Al-Kuwaity and his brother Saleh & ldquo ; are still staple of Arab-wide radio station - though sadly their heritage a Jews is never mentioned . & rdquo ; Radiohead , which won several Grammy Awards and sold million of record since the 1990s , have been the target of the boycott , divestment and sanction movement against Israel , especially in the lead-up to their 2017 concert in Tel Aviv . In response , lead singer Thom Yorke called BDS protester & ldquo ; offensive & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; patronizing , & rdquo ; adding , & ldquo ; The person who know most about these thing is Jonny . & rdquo ; In an Instagram post this week , Tassa called Greenwood & ldquo ; an amazing person who is always willing to take risk for peace and justice & rdquo ; and a dear friend . & ldquo ; Our desire and choice a musician from different background ( he is an English rocker and I am a Jewish-Israeli who absorbed root of Arab culture ) have always been and will continue to be , to strive to understand the & lsquo ; other , & rsquo ; to get to know him and to introduce him to u through the language of music - completely the opposite of fostering a one-sided discourse of boycott and threat , & rdquo ; Tassa wrote . & ldquo ; The truth is that the boycotters and condemners do not promote anything - just more hatred , & rdquo ; he added . & ldquo ; I hope and wish that together our performance will unite and connect people from different background and be part of a small step towards a better future . & rdquo ; Greenwood did not explicitly mention the war , the Palestinians or Gaza in his statement , angering some of his critic . But he acknowledged that his planned performance with Tassa come at a difficult time . & ldquo ; No art is a & lsquo ; important & rsquo ; a stopping all the death and suffering around u . How can it be ? But doing nothing seems a worse option , & rdquo ; he wrote . & ldquo ; And silencing Israeli artist for being born Jewish in Israel doesn & rsquo ; t seem like any way to reach an understanding between the two side of this apparently endless conflict . & rdquo ;",radiohead ’ s jonny greenwood reject call to cancel tour with israeli musician dudu tassa

We must not allow it to collapse . & rdquo ; The Israeli prime minister said his government wa ready to offer economic support to the PA based in the West Bank town of Ramallah.Netanyahu & rsquo ; s remark were reported on a radio news program owned by KAN , the Israeli public broadcaster.The Palestinian Authority 's response to Netanyahu 's remark on statehoodIn an official response , Hussein al-Sheikh , civil affair minister for the PA , rejected Netanyahu & rsquo ; s remark . & ldquo ; The role of the Palestinian Authority is to achieve the Palestinian national project of freedom , independence , and protection of the Palestinian people , & rdquo ; Sheikh said . The PA & ldquo ; ha not and will not accept anything other than this national and historical role . & rdquo ; Palestinians have long sought to establish an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , with eastern Jerusalem a it capital , alongside Israel . This arrangement is popularly known a the & ldquo ; two-state solution & rdquo ; to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.The Israeli Prime Minister & rsquo ; s Office did not deny Netanyahu & rsquo ; s comment . If accurate , Palestinian leader say , the comment prove the premier & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; true motif . & rdquo ; In year past , Netanyahu ha offered perfunctory support for the internationally backed notion of an independent Palestinian state , provided it had no military or security power.Netanyahu & rsquo ; s statement aroused widespread anger in other Palestinian political quarters.Nabil Abu Rudeineh , Abbas & rsquo ; spokesperson , said that establishing an independent Palestinian state , with East Jerusalem a it capital , is the only solution to achieve long-term security and stability . & ldquo ; Netanyahu may not hope for the collapse of the PA , publicly at least , but his goal is clear : Keep it a weak a can be , & rdquo ; an aide to President Abbas told The Media Line . The aide , who requested anonymity , insisted that the PA is a & ldquo ; national achievement & rdquo ; that no one , including Netanyahu , can change . & ldquo ; The alternative to the PA collapse is chaos , and it will mean the end of the Oslo Accords and any peace process , & rdquo ; he said.Israeli and Palestinian leader signed the first and second Oslo Accords in 1993 and 1995 . In those agreement , Palestinian leader recognized Israel & rsquo ; s right to exist in return for Israel & rsquo ; s recognition of the Palestinian people & rsquo ; s right to self-determination.Many assumed those agreement would eventually lead to a two-state solution . However , Talks remain frozen , and the Palestine Authority ha limited control over roughly 40 % of the West Bank . In Gaza , a Palestinian Islamist group , Hamas , seized power from the PA in 2007 . & ldquo ; We know what we want , but Israel can & rsquo ; t seem to get itself to say clearly and publicly what it want . We are at the mercy of those who are controlling the government , whose main goal is to appease their electoral base , & rdquo ; the PA aide argued.US-based Palestinian affair expert Hasan Awwad told The Media Line that the collapse of the PA is & ldquo ; underway & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; inevitable & rdquo ; a it effectiveness is & ldquo ; dismal . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; Israel ha been increasing it settlement expansion , making it impossible to create a Palestinian state . There is no political horizon , and Palestinians don & rsquo ; t see the light at the end of the tunnel , & rdquo ; Awwad said.Many believe Netanyahu began implementing a plan to eliminate the possibility of a viable Palestinian state year ago . The Israeli leader , who chair the right-wing Likud party , ruled the country from 1996 to 1999 , 2009 to 2021 , and January this year.During that time , critic say , his government have expanded West Bank settlement and built new road in such a way a to exclude the establishment of a territorially contiguous , sovereign Palestinian state.Since retaking office in January , the veteran Israeli politician & rsquo ; s ruling coalition , which is more religious and nationalist than it predecessor , ha approved building over 7,000 new housing unit for Jewish Israelis living in West Bank settlements.Many in the international community regard those settlement a violation of the Geneva Conventions and an impediment to peace . However , Netanyahu and his coalition partner regard the settlement a Jewish return to an area they once ruled.Ahmad Rafiq Awad , president of the Center for Jerusalem Studies at Al-Quds University , told The Media Line , & ldquo ; It is clear that Netanyahu wa never an advocate of a two-state solution . & rdquo ; Now , Awad say , Netanyahu ha & ldquo ; finally revealed his real strategy : he is not serious about having a neighboring Palestinian state . & rdquo ; Unlike minister in his government who have called for an end to PA rule in part of the West Bank , however , Netanyahu doe not want the Ramallah-based authority to disappear . Instead , Awad say , Netanyahu want the PA to help Israel & ldquo ; manage the occupation and maintain the status quo . & rdquo ; The Ramallah-based authority , Awwad say , & ldquo ; ha helped whitewash Israeli occupation legally , morally , and financially . & rdquo ; Netanyahu want & ldquo ; an agent that doe the dirty work for Israel , and the PA doe part of that , & rdquo ; he added.Palestinian force are responsible for municipal service and internal security in the West Bank & rsquo ; s area A and B . In practice , Palestinian police often tacitly cooperate with the Israeli military in it pursuit of suspects.Palestinian political institution are under increasing economic pressure . For example , Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh warned recently that his agency wa not receiving it regular disbursement of international aid , threatening it ability to continue operations.Moien Odeh , a specialist in Palestinian affair , human right , and international law , told The Media Line that Netanyahu & rsquo ; s remark are , in fact , nothing new.Israel , Odeh say , ha always regarded the PA a & ldquo ; a subcontractor & rdquo ; responsible for Palestinians & rsquo ; & ldquo ; daily need & rdquo ; and some of Israel & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; security concern . & rdquo ; It also offer Israel relief from international pressure to maintain a semblance of political negotiation and provide for some of the Palestinians & rsquo ; needs.Now , however , & ldquo ; Netanyahu said explicitly that the Palestine Authority is the end [ goal ] , not a step toward [ an eventual Palestinian ] state , & rdquo ; a others have assumed since Oslo . & ldquo ; Of course , & rdquo ; Odeh say , & ldquo ; the policy and action of all Israeli government have always been in this direction . & rdquo ; The Palestinian Authority ha failed to unite Palestinians , Odeh say , and it fate ha always been & ldquo ; linked to Israel in most or even all respect . & rdquo ; The authority can not & ldquo ; survive without Israeli and international support and funding , & rdquo ; keeping it & ldquo ; permanently hostage to aid . & rdquo ;",palestinian furious over netanyahu claim that israel must ' crush ' statehood ambition

In addition , Netanyahu will hold ad-hoc & ldquo ; security consultation & rdquo ; on specific matter when necessary.The spokesperson did not answer a number of follow-up question , including what the division of responsibility will be between the security cabinet and these & ldquo ; consultation . & rdquo ; Furthermore , the spokesperson did not address the statutory status of these consultation , such a whether they will be transcribed in an official protocol like the now-defunct war cabinet did . They also did not specify who would participate in these consultations.The deliberation will likely serve two purpose : The first will be to avoid having to convene the security cabinet over minor decision , and the second will be to keep sensitive information away from the far Right Ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.Both Ben-Gvir and Smotrich , who are both member of the security cabinet but were not appointed to the war cabinet , repeatedly criticized the latter since it founding for policy that they believed were not aggressive enough . In addition , many leak emerged from the security cabinet during the month of the war , with Ben-Gvir believed to be the source of many of these.Ben-Gvir , Smotrich 's threat were feltThis led the prime minister to avoid including them in certain decision or revealing specific information . For example , according to Ben-Gvir , Netanyahu refused to show him a draft of Israel & rsquo ; s latest proposal for a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas.Still , according to MKs Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot of the National Unity Party , who , until recently , were member of the war cabinet , the presence of Ben-Gvir & rsquo ; s and Smotrich & rsquo ; s threat to leave the government over what they deemed were unacceptable concession to Hamas , wa felt tangibly in the room . Gantz and Eisenkot said that at one point , Netanyahu limited the mandate given to Israel & rsquo ; s negotiating team without updating them due to pressure from Smotrich.Both Ben-Gvir and Smotrich demanded to be part of the war cabinet once Gantz and Eisenkot left the government last week.However , instead of conceding to their request , Netanyahu opted to dissolve the war cabinet completely . Nevertheless , it is clear that Ben-Gvir and Smotrich will now enjoy even more influence over security decision given that the security cabinet will convene more frequently.In interview with foreign medium in recent month , Netanyahu repeatedly distanced himself from incendiary comment made by Ben-Gvir and Smotrich and member of their party , such a calling for a & ldquo ; voluntary emigration & rdquo ; of Gaza & rsquo ; s population or building Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip.Indeed , the prime minister repeatedly argued that all minister were free to voice their opinion a they saw fit but that the decision and policy were decided on only in the war cabinet . With the war cabinet now gone , the prime minister will likely find it more difficult to make this argument.Perhaps more significantly , Israel made the same argument in the case made against it in both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court at the Hague . Because according to Israeli representative , statement made by Ben-Gvir , Smotrich , and others were not indicative of official policy , since formal Israeli policy were decided upon within Israel & rsquo ; s war cabinet.With the war cabinet gone , remark by Ben-Gvir and Smotrich could carry more weight and may very possibly negatively affect the ongoing case against Israel . & nbsp ;",netanyahu dissolve war cabinet : will it change israel 's war on hamas ? - analysis

By endorsing a universal draft , the court ha taken a bold step towards fostering a sense of unity and shared sacrifice among all sector of Israeli society , at a time when the country need it most . Demographically , the question of haredi enlistment will become even more urgent a the ultra-Orthodox become the dominant population in the country.While there are many more stop along the journey of universal enlistment in Israel & rsquo ; s military , the government , the judiciary , and those who are willing to serve , many of whom are religious themselves and Torah student , can not let themselves be held to ransom by one sector of society that refuse to contribute to the ongoing survival of the country.Israel , unlike many country around the world , desperately requires it military to survive . The country & rsquo ; s very existence depends upon it army , and the ongoing Israel-Hamas War prof how necessary it is.Netanyahu ha managed to survive in power despite a tumultuous period , beginning last year with continuous protest against the government 's planned judicial reform , an act that wa halted when Hamas terrorist crossed the border on October 7 . He ha since been dealing with the ongoing military operation in Gaza.It would be ironic if Bibi & rsquo ; s bedfellow in government , the ultra-Orthodox party , were to do what the judicial protest nor the war against Hamas have done and bring the government toppling.The court & rsquo ; s ruling should serve a a catalyst for meaningful dialogue and engagement on the issue of military service instead of pathetic threat of emigration and political discord . It creates an opportunity for policymakers , religious leader , and civil society stakeholder to come together and explore a peaceful solution to the national service question that Israel desperately need to answer .

2023-05-10 01:34:50.123,jpost,"Israel thwarted an attempted by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) terrorist cell to produce rocket and a launcher in the Jenin refugee camp in the northern West Bank in recent week , Shin Bet head Ronen Bar revealed during a press conference on Tuesday evening.Bar stressed that Tareq Ezzaldin , a spokesperson for the PIJ who wa assassinated by the IDF in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday morning , had been attempting to replicate terrorist capability in Gaza to the West Bank and Israel.According to Bar , Ezzaldin directly organized 20 terrorist cell who aimed to murder Israelis , including the cell who attempted to produce rocket . Ezzaldin provided the cell with knowledge and funding . `` We have no intention of turning Afula or Shaked into a target for indirect fire , `` said the Shin Bet chief . `` Most of the activity to thwart these cell is not known to the public , but it is known to u and the risk is known to u and illustrated every day . `` Ezzaldin additionally recruited a number of individual from the Ramallah area and provided them with fund to purchase weapon , including a quadcopter to use in attack against Israeli civilian . The terrorist cell recruited by Ezzaldin wa arrested , thwarting the attack.Bar stressed that these thwarted cell are just a few example of Ezzaldin 's `` terrorist enterprise , `` adding `` we have no intention of waiting defensively for threat , but are always acting on the offensive against those sending them , in the Kasbah in Nablus , a happened again this morning , in Gaza City and anywhere else in the Middle East . `` `` It is important to say , the PIJ is an organization that is fully funded by Iran .

2023-05-10 15:44:33.133,jpost,"Around the Gaza Strip , the morning of the second day of Operation Shield and Arrow began quietly . Communities were told to either go to shelter or remain close by . I drove south from Jerusalem , a drive that took about an hour and a half . The police and army had closed off some area around the Strip . Traffic from Ashkelon wa blocked to Sderot , a these area were expected to be under direct threat , which extended dozen of kilometer inland.When I arrived on the border , it wa still quiet , without much traffic . There are still industry operating around the border , so there are many people who have to use the road . I had been in this area many time before during numerous conflict over the last two decade . Most of the landscape is field , and there were a few soldier who had set up a checkpoint south of Ashkelon near Yad Mordechai and the turnoff to Karmiya.I drove out toward Karmiya and Zikim Beach until there were more roadblock . Then I paused and wondered what would come next . The radio said people could leave their shelter . Israel had carried out strike against site in Khan Yunis and Beit Lahiya . I could see smoke rising from Beit Lahiya . As I began to drive back towards a hill that overlook the border area , I could see streak of white smoke rising from Gaza . These are the telltale sign of rocket . Soon , Iron Dome wa at work overhead , it Tamir interceptor missile flying toward the rockets.The rocket fire beginsThis wa just the opening salvo of a long series of salvo that poured missile over our head . It began at 1:27 p.m . and continued at 1:30 p.m . , 1:35 p.m . and every five or 10 minute after that until a brief lull at 2:30 p.m . , before restarting around 3 p.m . , when more rocket were fired toward area south of Tel Aviv . The rocket were intercepted by Iron Dome in dozen of interceptions.Each of these salvo and the interceptor heading toward them could be seen from area south of Ashkelon . The rocket fire wa concentrated here . Smoke filled the sky and slowly drifted away with each round of interception . Some rocket fell in open area nearby , and smoke rose from the fields.IDF air defense are seen intercepting rocket fired from Gaza into Israel , on May 10 , 2023 ( video credit : Seth J . Frantzman ) Inside Gaza , loud boom indicated that Israel wa responding . The radio continued to say where the siren were sounding and to encourage people to go to their shelter . In many area along the road , there are no shelter , so car had to brave the road south of Ashkelon with nothing more to do than keep driving.The number of salvo in broad daylight took place a they have in the past . However , standing under the missile fired from Gaza and the Iron Dome interceptor wa still jarring . There were siren in the distance , but in some area , there are no siren , and therefore you can be standing outside and suddenly see small bright light tailed by smoke rising into the area from Iron Dome interceptor heading to stop the missiles.As the afternoon continued , it appeared that Islamic Jihad began to use it longer-range rocket , firing them toward area in the center of the country , such a Rishon Lezion , a well a other area , such a Netivot . Border area were spared some of the rocket , a they flew high up in the air , way above the few resident who remained near the border.Nevertheless , for many of those working industry near the border , or living in the larger town such a Sderot , there wa nowhere to go . Most of them are used to the situation . Trucks continued to go back and forth from industrial area , and civilian continued to drive on the most essential roads.I drove over to the industrial area south of Ashkelon , where several road stretch into the distance , toward the sea , the Rutenberg Power Station and Zikim Beach . As I drove , I could hear siren , and the radio wa saying there were rocket headed for Ashkelon . The loud scream of Iron Dome interceptor grasping upward led me to look toward the coast , where the battle overhead wa taking place between Islamic Jihad rocket and Iron Dome . The interceptor did their work . I tried to get a better vantage point , but there were roadblocks.I know this area well because I & rsquo ; ve covered war here since 2009 & rsquo ; s Operation Cast Lead . The name of the operation fade with time & ndash ; Pillar of Defense , Defensive Edge , Black Belt , Guardian of the Walls , Breaking Dawn . It ha been two year since Guardian began in this same area . It wa back in 2014 that Hamas tried to infiltrate terrorist near here in the dune near Zikim . And in September 2014 , Avera Mengistu , an Israeli man , crossed into Gaza near here and is still being held by Hamas . I thought of those experience a I drove back toward Ashkelon.The overall sense is that we & rsquo ; ve been here before . This time , the local authority and home front were quick to encourage people to go into shelter , and child were mostly moved from smaller border community , while adult stayed home from work in the city . In Ashkelon , the mall were closed , for instance . Most of the street were quiet . Most playground were empty , except one that had two kid and their father on it.The rocket had peaked in the early afternoon , and then there were several more salvo through sunset , when rumor of a ceasefire seemed to encourage Islamic Jihad to fire wildly at city far from Gaza . Israel & rsquo ; s operation against the terrorist group continue frequently , but it & rsquo ; s unclear if this ha become routine & ndash ; a choreographed series of event where a ceasefire will result , but both side know the next round is soon . The radio program playing a I drove back to Jerusalem all seemed cynical ; it wa only a matter of time until the next round of rocket and airstrikes .",on the gaza border : rocket fly over israeli ' head - reporter 's notebook

The time ha come for new idea , & rdquo ; he said.The veteran politician , who is a fierce opponent of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , quit the government this week , after making a failed bid to be included in the war cabinet.He had entered the government together with the National Unity Party at the start of the war to make a difference , but once he understood that wa not possible , he left , in a move that wa symbolic of the political turmoil , but which barely dented the coalition & rsquo ; s governing capacity , bringing it down from 76 to 72 seat . & ldquo ; We are stuck in every direction . We are stuck in Gaza . We are stuck on the Lebanese border .

He called for the & ldquo ; surrender and exile of the Hamas military wing and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad from Gaza to country friendly to them : Syria , Turkey , Qatar , and Iran . & rdquo ; The hostage would be freed in conjunction , and the deal could also include an Israeli agreement to release some Palestinian security prisoner and terrorist , he said.The framing of the idea , he said , should be that it is Israel & rsquo ; s ceasefire proposal , rather than perpetually being in the position of appearing to object to a halt to the war.It also work a an answer to the international objection to Israel & rsquo ; s pending military operation in Rafah to destroy the remaining Hamas battalions.The & ldquo ; argument against it would be that Hamas won & rsquo ; t agree to it . That is probably correct , & rdquo ; he said , & ldquo ; at least not at this moment . & ldquo ; But at least we can tell the world and say , & lsquo ; We want to enter Rafah , but we do not have to . & rsquo ; If this [ Hamas surrender and exile plan ] happens , then we can end the war . You say you want a ceasefire . You want to end Hamas & rsquo ; s governance [ of Gaza ] . Well , here is a pragmatic idea that also end the humanitarian suffering caused by the war , & rdquo ; he stated.This framing help put the onus on Hamas for the failure to achieve a ceasefire , he explained . & ldquo ; It give u more legitimization with our friend , and then , if there are no other option , & rdquo ; Israel can explain that it ha to finish the war because Hamas won & rsquo ; t agree to end it , Sa & rsquo ; ar said.His second issue dealt with the failure around the delivery of humanitarian assistance , for which Israel did not provide option effectively and quickly enough.Sa & rsquo ; ar spoke amid a bitter dispute between Israel and the international community on the issue of humanitarian assistance , with the United Nations and the European Union accusing Israel of creating starvation condition in Gaza.Israel ha said that more than enough aid enters Gaza , but that the UN and international organization have failed to properly distribute it.The army should have seized control of the situation from the start and created a humanitarian administration to ensure the distribution of food and the provision of water and basic sanitation , Sa & rsquo ; ar said.The international community would still provide the aid and be involved , but the army would have oversight to make sure that delivery is successful . & ldquo ; I know the army doesn & rsquo ; t love this , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar said , acknowledging that there are some risk with the plan , which could lead to increased friction between the IDF and Palestinian civilian in Gaza.It & rsquo ; s a plan that also tackle some of the governance vacuum created by the IDF & rsquo ; s military campaign against Hamas , which partially but not completely eliminated the terrorist group & rsquo ; s forced rule of the enclave.Until Hamas is destroyed , there can & rsquo ; t be an alternative government in Gaza , Sa & rsquo ; ar said , adding that IDF control of the distribution of basic service , in partnership with international organization , is the only smart option that can prevent the terrorist group & rsquo ; s return.If the IDF had taken charge of issue of food , water , medicine , and sanitation , Israel would have a better & ldquo ; standing in the international community , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar stressed.His third point , Sa & rsquo ; ar said , is that the war ha to proceed at a quicker pace for the sake of Israel & rsquo ; s economy , it international standing , and the looming threat of an all-out war with Hezbollah in the north . & ldquo ; We have always known that we needed to wage the war a quickly a possible , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; It is hard for u to wage long-term war . & rdquo ; Some thought that the international community would lose interest in the war a time went on , Sa & rsquo ; ar explained , adding that he always believed Israel had a tight timeline for the war . & ldquo ; It wa clear from the start that this idea wa mistaken . We can & rsquo ; t drag on the war forever , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; As long a you haven & rsquo ; t ended the Gaza war , you can & rsquo ; t deal with Hezbollah , & rdquo ; he added.Hezbollah ha to withdraw from the border , he said , a he referenced diplomatic effort to ensure that it complies with Resolution 1701 , which set out the ceasefire term that ended the Second Lebanon War in 2006.Only then can the resident in community along that border , who were evacuated at the start of the Gaza war when violence broke out simultaneously with Lebanon , return home.In the end , they will return home . & ldquo ; It ha to happen , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar stressed , but that he hope Israel will do it through diplomacy and not through a full-scale war.Sa'ar : A Palestinian state is a danger to IsraelSA & rsquo ; AR , WHO began his political life in the Likud in 2003 , and formed his own party , initially called New Hope , in 2020 , doe not disagree with all of Netanyahu & rsquo ; s policies.He ha always been opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state , even more so now in the aftermath of October 7 . & ldquo ; A Palestinian state is a danger to Israel , to it security , and it is not a & lsquo ; maybe & rsquo ; danger ; it & rsquo ; s a clear danger . The creation of a Palestinian state would allow them to continue their war to destroy Israel from an improved position . & rdquo ; It would & ldquo ; strengthen those Palestinian force who believe that war brings result . & rdquo ; Israel ha to work to prevent Palestinian statehood , he said . It can take a positive stance on other issue regarding the Palestinians , but it can & rsquo ; t allow itself to go in this direction.Should the Palestinian Authority be reformed , such that it stop it monthly payment to terrorist jailed by Israel and the incitement in it education system , then it could be possible to advance in certain area , he said.Sa & rsquo ; ar said he stand with Netanyahu in opposing the return of the PA to Gaza . He ha also supported many of the stance Netanyahu ha taken in the international arena , including in his relationship with the United States . & ldquo ; Netanyahu is acting to preserve Israel & rsquo ; s international interest in this war , and in most of the situation when he fought with the US , I thought he wa right , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar explained . & ldquo ; Historically , prime minister have been at odds with supportive US president during a war , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar said , a he recalled the diplomatic battle between former prime minister Menachem Begin and former US president Ronald Reagan during the First Lebanon War.He pointed to the most recent battle between Jerusalem and Washington over the Biden administration & rsquo ; s failure on Monday to veto a UN Security Council resolution that called for a temporary pause to the war , without tying it to the release of any of the remaining 134 hostage in Gaza.Before the UNSC vote , Netanyahu threatened that if the US didn & rsquo ; t use it veto , he wouldn & rsquo ; t send a high-level delegation to Washington for a scheduled meeting . After the vote , Netanyahu held to his word but ha since backed down and is looking to dispatch the delegation to the US next week.It wa a mistake for Netanyahu to attempt to back the US into a corner , and it didn & rsquo ; t increase the chance of a veto , Sa & rsquo ; ar said.Netanyahu should have kept his objection private , but essentially he wa correct that the vote wa bad for Israel , Sa & rsquo ; ar said.The issue here is one of style , he explained.Netanyahu ha & ldquo ; to know how to stand strong with friend , but to do it when it is essential , and to do it in a respectful way , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar said.He himself ha a long history of standing on principle and wa one of the group of what wa known a the & ldquo ; Likud rebel & rdquo ; who opposed former prime minister Ariel Sharon & rsquo ; s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and the destruction of the 21 settlement there.Sa & rsquo ; ar recalled how he had argued with former foreign minister Tzipi Livni , who wa then in Sharon & rsquo ; s government , about the Disengagement . She had contended that the withdrawal would legitimize Israel & rsquo ; s right to self-defense against the Palestinians , Sa & rsquo ; ar recalled . He had disputed that.History ha shown , Sa & rsquo ; ar said , that & ldquo ; I wa correct . & rdquo ;","israel need gaza ceasefire plan exiling hamas , gideon sa'ar tell ' post ' - interview"
2024-05-19 17:15:47.653,jpost,"Garfield , that lazy , lasagna-loving cat , is back , in The Garfield Movie , which opened throughout Israel this week , and this ferociously selfish feline may be just the character we need to spend a couple of hour with right now.The movie , which did not have advance screening prior to press time , is the latest screen portrayal of the surly pet.Those who like to take their child to English-language movie rather than dubbed version of animated movie are in luck , because this is being released in theater in two version , one dubbed into Hebrew and one in English with Hebrew title , probably because Garfield movie tend to appeal to adult a well a kids.There & rsquo ; s something liberating and almost politically incorrect about seeing a character a gluttonous , lazy , and bossy a Garfield . Other than James Bond when he & rsquo ; s not on a mission , what character get to do what he want to do all day , every day ? Right , only Garfield.This time , sadly , Bill Murray , who voiced the cantankerous cat in the 2004 Garfield movie and in 2006 & rsquo ; s Garfield : A Tail of Two Kitties , is not around . Murray & rsquo ; s vaguely hostile hipster persona wa perfect for the character . This time , Chris Pratt voice a slightly less cynical , slightly more energetic-sounding Garfield.The new film is all animated , unlike the previous two , in which Garfield wa animated and digitally inserted into live-action scenes.The plotWe learn how Jon Arbuckle ( Nicholas Hoult , who made his big-screen debut over 20 year ago , playing the teen who befriends Hugh Grant in About a Boy ) first met his very prideful pet . Jon wa having a slice of pizza in a restaurant when he saw Garfield , then a kitten , looking pitiful outside . Jon invited him in , and Garfield consumed the pizza and everything not nailed down.This film feature the usual Garfield antic , but then get into a plot that tell the story of how Garfield get back in touch with his father , a scruffy alley cat named Vic , voiced by Samuel L . Jackson , of Pulp Fiction and so many other movie . & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m mixed up with some bad cat , and I need your help , & rdquo ; say Vic.Garfield reply , & ldquo ; I haven & rsquo ; t seen you for year , and when I do , you pull me into a life of crime . & rdquo ; Vic asks if he ha ever jumped a train , to which Garfield responds , & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; ve never jumped . & rdquo ; Vic is being blackmailed by his former associate , Jinx ( Hannah Waddington of Ted Lasso ) , and he want to pay her to leave him alone so he can concentrate on his next heist : a large-scale robbery of Lactose Farms , after which he promise they will be set for life.Liz , Jon & rsquo ; s sometime girlfriend and Garfield & rsquo ; s veterinarian , is played by Dev Joshi . Ving Rhames ( who played Jackson & rsquo ; s gangster bos in Pulp Fiction ) and Cecily Strong of SNL portray character who get mixed up in the heist , while rapper Snoop Dog voice a character called Snoop Cat.If you & rsquo ; d like to see the older version of Garfield , you can watch The Garfield Show , a series from about 15 year ago , on Netflix . The two Bill Murray movie are available on Disney + and Apple TV + . Garfield started out a a comic strip , created by Jim Davis , that wa published in an Indiana newspaper in the late & rsquo ; 70 and wa originally called Jon.Raised on an Indiana farm with 25 cat , Davis later worked in advertising and created the comic strip , thinking at first that reader would connect to story of the nebbishy Jon , but everyone loved Garfield so much that he quickly had to change the name and the focus of the comic , admitting that Garfield had turned out to be his bos . Soon , the cartoon wa syndicated in thousand of newspaper and now is also available online at Garfield.com / . Davis attribute some of it success to the fact that it is apolitical . & ldquo ; My grasp of politics isn & rsquo ; t strong , & rdquo ; he admitted in an interview.While the movie always have a fairly complicated plot , child seeing them tend to respond most strongly to the silly stuff , like Jon giving the scowling Garfield a bath and blow-drying his fur . And there look to be enough of that here to keep them amused .",garfield is back and bigger than ever - film review
2022-04-20 20:35:59.463,jpost,"For Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , the event of the past week in Jerusalem have been both a blessing and a curse.On the one hand , he managed to get Israel into trouble with many country by portraying it a the & ldquo ; aggressor . & rdquo ; On the other hand , what happened at al-Aqsa Mosque compound ( Temple Mount ) ha emboldened his rival in Hamas and other extremist group , showing that they have more influence and support in Jerusalem than the PA or Jordan.The violence that erupted at the Temple Mount last Friday brought the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back to the center of the world & rsquo ; s attention , which ha been almost entirely focused on the Russian invasion of Ukraine since February . This came a good news for Abbas.Since the Ukraine war began , Palestinian official in Ramallah have been working hard to redirect the international community & rsquo ; s attention toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Their major concern wa that Israel would exploit the world & rsquo ; s preoccupation with the war to impose new fact on the ground , especially in Jerusalem and it Islamic holy site . But in the past week these official have expressed satisfaction with the wide coverage the violence in Jerusalem received in the international media.Abbas and his aide were even more delighted to see the large number of condemnation of Israel , in particular those coming from Arab and Islamic countries.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken & rsquo ; s phone call to his Jordanian counterpart , during which he & ldquo ; emphasized the importance of upholding the historic status quo at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount , & rdquo ; wa also received with deep satisfaction in Ramallah and Amman . Abbas wa also happy to receive a phone call from Blinken with a similar message.Ever since the resumption of Jewish visit to the Temple Mount several year ago , the PA leadership ha been accusing Israel of waging & ldquo ; religious war & rdquo ; on the Muslims.The accusation , which continues to this day , aim to rally a many Arabs and Muslims a possible against Israel . The visit of the Jews are portrayed by Palestinian and Jordanian official and medium outlet a violent incursion by extremist settler under the protection of the Israel Police.Yet , the allegation failed to achieve their goal , a the reaction of most Arabs and Muslims have remained limited to lip service.Scenes of Palestinians burning flag and photo of Arab leader engaged in normalization with Israel managed to enrage many Arabs , especially those residing in the Gulf state . Those Arabs were further enraged when they saw Palestinians curse and harass Emirati and Bahraini visitor to the Temple Mount.The Abraham Accords , which were signed between Israel and a number of Arab country , a well a the apparent rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia , left the Palestinians with the impression that the Arabs and Muslims do not really care about Israel & rsquo ; s ostensible scheme to change the status quo at the Temple Mount by allocating time and space for Jewish prayer there.That & rsquo ; s why Palestinian official in Ramallah were pleased this week to see the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain and Saudi Arabia condemn & ldquo ; the Israel Police & rsquo ; s storming of al-Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; These official , however , are aware that the UAE and Bahrain are not going to take drastic measure , such a recalling their ambassador from Israel.By contrast , the PA leadership appears to be content with the crisis that erupted this week between Israel and Jordan in the aftermath of the violence at the Temple Mount.Since the beginning of the tension at the holy site , the PA and Jordan have been holding intensive discussion on & ldquo ; defending & rdquo ; al-Aqsa Mosque and & ldquo ; thwarting & rdquo ; Israel & rsquo ; s alleged attempt to alter the status quo . The feeling in Ramallah is that the Jordanians are the only one who are siding with the Palestinians . & ldquo ; The State of Palestine commended the courageous Jordanian stance expressed by King Abdullah of Jordan and the Jordanian government , parliament and people in defending Jerusalem and the Christian and Islamic holy site , & rdquo ; the PA said in a statement issued by it foreign ministry . & ldquo ; The State of Palestine and it people highly appreciate the diplomatic activity led by King Abdullah to expose the Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; THE PA and Jordan , nonetheless , have good reason to be worried about the event of the past week . The violence that erupted at the Temple Mount ha shown that Ramallah and Amman have little influence , if any , over the young men and woman who clashed with the Israeli security forces.The Jordanian-controlled Wakf Islamic religious trust , which is responsible for administering the Islamic holy site in Jerusalem , failed to stop dozen of rioter from entering the mosque with stone and firework . The Wakf ha dozen of security guard stationed at the Temple Mount , but they did not intervene to stop the rioter and thug from sneaking into the mosque.Similarly , the PA , which ha it own supporter and representative at the Temple Mount , did not do anything to stop the rioter from storming into al-Aqsa Mosque with a large cache of stone and other objects.On the eve of Ramadan , some Israeli and US official approached the PA and Jordan and asked them to work toward preventing an outbreak of violence in Jerusalem , particularly the Temple Mount.But instead of appealing for calm , Ramallah and Amman ramped up their rhetorical attack on Israel , warning that allowing Jews to enter the Temple Mount would ignite & ldquo ; religious war & rdquo ; and plunge the entire region into a fresh cycle of violence.The PA and Jordan do not feel comfortable admitting that supporter of Hamas and other extremist group are the one who call the shot at the Temple Mount . It & rsquo ; s easier for Ramallah and Amman to hold Israel solely responsible for the violence than denounce the rioter who desecrated al-Aqsa Mosque . In fact , the PA and Jordan seem to have scored a diplomatic and propaganda achievement by convincing many in the international community that it wa Israel that planned and initiated the violence.While the violence seems to have served Abbas & rsquo ; s goal of shifting the blame toward Israel , he nevertheless appears worried that he wa excluded from the first stage of the mediation effort to restore calm.Instead of talking to Abbas , the Egyptians , Qataris and the United Nations chose to negotiate with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , who is based in Qatar.According to Palestinian source , Abbas wa & ldquo ; furious & rdquo ; for being sidelined by the mediator , mainly because this allows Hamas to score more point with the Palestinian public and gain more legitimacy in the international arena.Abdullah , for his part , is worried that the violence at the Temple Mount and the rising tension with Israel could cost the Hashemites their status a custodian of the Islamic and Christian holy site in Jerusalem . He is well aware that Palestinian teenager hurling stone at Israeli police officer have more influence than his Wakf in Jerusalem . But that doe not mean that the monarch is prepared to walk away from the city.In recent year , report have surfaced that Israel may allow Saudi Arabia and other Arab and Islamic country to replace the Hashemites a the sole custodian of the holy site . The report are said to have angered Abdullah , who ha since been making a huge effort to reassert the royal family & rsquo ; s role in tending the Islamic and Christian holy site in Jerusalem . He doe not seem to be worried if Hamas present itself a the & ldquo ; defender & rdquo ; of Jerusalem , a long a that doe not affect the Hashemites & rsquo ; status a & ldquo ; custodian & rdquo ; of the holy sites.Like Abbas , Abdullah is also worried about the increasing role Hamas and other Islamist group are playing at the Temple Mount.Videos and photo featuring rioter wrapped in Hamas flag and chanting slogan in support of Hamas arch-terrorist Mohammed Deif over the past week have undoubtedly left Abdullah perturbed . Still , he doe not seem to be worried if Hamas present itself a the & ldquo ; defender & rdquo ; of Jerusalem , a long a that doe not affect the Hashemites & rsquo ; status a & ldquo ; custodian & rdquo ; of the holy sites.In Ramallah , PA official were also unhappy to see the Hamas supporter leading the riots.THERE & rsquo ; S NO doubt that the inflammatory statement that came from Ramallah and Amman before and during the event of the past week served the interest of Hamas and other extremist in orchestrating the riot at the Temple Mount.Abbas and Abdullah would have been happy to see the rioter raise their photo ; instead , they got Hamas banner and flag , and were forced to watch and hear Palestinians calling on the Gaza-based terrorist group to fire rocket at Israel.Now , it appears that Abbas and Abdullah are desperately trying to extinguish the very fire they helped ignite , not out of concern for Israel & rsquo ; s security , but out of fear of being totally removed from the holy site.But because they don & rsquo ; t dare to speak out against the young men and woman who have turned al-Aqsa Mosque into a battlefield and spoiled the Ramadan celebration and prayer for hundred of thousand of Muslim worshipper , the current strategy of the PA and Jordan is to get the international community to exert pressure on Israel to halt Jewish & ldquo ; provocation . & rdquo ; Even if the situation doe calm down after Ramadan end ( a expected ) , it & rsquo ; s evident that the status quo ha indeed shifted at the Temple Mount.But it & rsquo ; s not Israel that ha changed the status quo ; rather , it & rsquo ; s the shabab ( youth ) and Hamas who have managed to create a new reality in which they are now the & ldquo ; custodian & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; defender & rdquo ; of al-Aqsa Mosque . & bull ;",temple mount tension further embolden hamas
2024-04-26 05:34:59.993,jpost,"Hamas , through a senior official , stated it readiness to enter a cease-fire of five year or more with Israel and transition into a political entity if an independent Palestinian state is established along pre-1967 border . The official , Khalil al-Hayya , considered Sinwar & rsquo ; s right hand , expressed these view during a recent interview amidst stalled cease-fire negotiation . & nbsp ; Al-Hayya indicated this would only be a temporary stance until Palestinians retain their & ldquo ; historic right to all Palestinian land . & rdquo ; The Palestinian politician suggested Hamas ' willingness to join the Palestine Liberation Organization and form a unified government for Gaza and the West Bank and the dissolution of it military wing . Despite the devastation caused by recent hostility , Al-Hayya dismissed Israeli attempt to eradicate Hamas but spoke about a possible truce soon . & nbsp ; Dr . Ghassan Khatib , a lecturer at Birzeit & rsquo ; s University and former minister of labor for the Palestinian Authority , provided his perspective to The Media Line . `` It 's worth waiting to see if this statement reflects a significant shift , `` he noted , highlighting a common inconsistency between individual remark by Hamas leader and the group 's official stance.Dr . Khatib further explained the internal dynamic within Hamas : `` The statement can also reflect dissent and the debate within Hamas . Different leader have different view , but it could also be a tactic , considering the imminent threat of the Israeli army to enter Rafah . `` & nbsp ; He added that while the promise to dissolve the military wing and pursue a sovereign state wa notable , `` Hamas being willing to put it gun down isn & rsquo ; t something you hear every day . Dissolving the military wing of Hamas and falling in line with a Sovereign Palestinian State on the 1967 border would bring a powerful change . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; Whatever the reason they make this statement now , it & rsquo ; s important to dialogue with Hamas because they are a very relevant part of Palestinian internal politics . Whether the Israelis like it or not , that & rsquo ; s the fact . Even if the statement made by Al-Hayya ha condition unlikely to be accepted by Israel , it is important to continue the dialogue , and this is also true for America and other Western country , & rdquo ; he concluded.Natural skepticismWhile Dr . Khatib emphasizes the importance of dialogue with Hamas despite skepticism about their intention , some suggest a more cautious perspective , questioning the sincerity of Hamas ' statement and suggesting that their motif may be influenced by the immediate threat of Israeli military action.Chuck Freilich , former deputy national security adviser and senior fellow in INSS , told The Media Line , & ldquo ; Hamas is aware of it imminent demise if the IDF enters Rafah . Making remarkable statement , such a the one made by Al-Hayya , give them more time and feed into the narrative believed by their supporter worldwide . Still , Israeli leader should pursue this dialogue in the future if we have a different government . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; If this statement made by Al-Hayya is serious , then they should be open to dialogue after the Israeli conduct it plan to go into Rafah . It 's doubtful that Israel would entertain such dialogue , a it remains committed to dismantling Hamas . After Hamas is removed from Rafah , then the Palestinians should announce an initiative with their top leader or with a formal declaration , & rdquo ; concluded Chuck Freilich.While Hamas ha previously maintained a hardline stance against Israel , this shift towards a potential two-state solution represents a notable concession . However , it remains unclear if this signifies a permanent resolution to the conflict or merely an interim step toward Hamas ' longstanding goal of Israel 's destruction . & nbsp ; Israel nor the Palestinian Authority have yet to comment .","dissolving hamas ' military , forming sovereign palestinian state would bring ‘ change ’ - expert"

2023-02-06 18:22:05.773,jpost,"Hamas and a number of Palestinian armed group vowed on Monday to avenge the death of five gunman killed by Israeli security force during a raid on Aqbat Jaber Refugee Camp , located on the outskirt of Jericho.The five , identified by Hamas a Malek Lafi , 22 , Ra & rsquo ; fat Oweidat , 21 , Ibrahim Oweidat , 27 , Thaer Oweidat , 28 , and Adham Oweidat , 22 , belonged to the group & rsquo ; s armed wing , Izaddin al-Qassam.Palestinian source said the gunman operated in the camp under the name of a group called Aqbat Jaber Camp Battalion.A new armed Palestinian gunman group ha formed in JerichoThe new group , the first of it kind in the Jericho area , is seen by the source a part of an attempt to imitate similar militia that have been operating in the northern West Bank over the past year : Jenin Battalion , Nablus Battalion and Balata Refugee Camp Battalion , a well a the Lions & rsquo ; Den and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.While these group consist mostly of member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) and the ruling Fatah faction headed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , the slain Aqbat Jaber cell member all belonged to Hamas.Two of the gunman were involved in a shooting attack on January 28 against an Israeli-owned caf & eacute ; at Almog junction , located only a few kilometer away from Aqbat Jaber Refugee Camp . No one wa hurt.Since the attack , the IDF ha imposed strict security measure in the Jericho area , a move that badly hurt the local economy , which relies mainly on local tourism.The camp is located across the street from the Oasis Casino , the first gambling facility in the West Bank . The casino ha been shut since the start of the Second Intifada more than 20 year ago . Some of the camp resident previously worked in the casino and a nearby hotel.Last year , unconfirmed report claimed that Israel and the Palestinians were discussing the possibility of allowing the casino to reopen . The report revived hope in Aqbat Jaber camp in particular and Jericho in general that the local economy would be strengthened once the gambler , most of whom were Israeli citizen , returned to the casino.Despite the closure of the casino , Jericho ha over the past few year witnessed an unprecedented boom in local tourism a dozen of luxurious villa have popped up in and around the city . In addition , many foreign tourist have returned to the city in recent years.The villa , owned by Arab Israelis and resident of east Jerusalem , are offered for rent on a daily , weekly and monthly basis . Most of the client are Palestinian family from east Jerusalem and the West Bank , a well a Arab Israelis . & ldquo ; The street of Jericho were empty after the shooting operation [ at the Almog junction ] , & rdquo ; said a resident of east Jerusalem who owns two villa in Jericho . & ldquo ; Many people couldn & rsquo ; t go to Jericho because of the Israeli checkpoint . People rent the villa for private event , including birthday party and wedding . & rdquo ; He and other Palestinians who own business in Jericho expressed fear that the phenomenon of armed group and anarchy would spread from Jenin and Nablus to their city . They revealed that some activist from Jenin and Nablus moved to Jericho over the past year.Jericho : Once a `` sleepy town `` with stability despite violence in the West BankOnce described a a & ldquo ; sleepy town , & rdquo ; the situation in Jericho ha been generally stable over the past year , despite the significant upsurge of violence in the northern West Bank . The calm allowed many Arab investor from Israel and the West Bank to purchase relatively cheap land and build villa a vacation home for themselves and to put on the booming short-term rental market.The call by Hamas and other Palestinian group for avenging the killing of the five Aqbat Jaber militant indicates that the security situation in the Jericho area could further deteriorate in the coming day and weeks.In a statement published shortly after the armed clash in the camp , Hamas praised the & ldquo ; heroic resistance fighter & rdquo ; and said that the & ldquo ; confrontation with the enemy confirms once again that our people are on the path of resistance and liberation and won & rsquo ; t be intimidated by the crime of the occupation . & rdquo ; The Aqbat Baber Camp Battalion also pledged to retaliate for the killing of it men , although it remains unclear whether the group ha more member operating in the camp and other area of Jericho . What is certain , however , is that the Hamas member operated inside a camp located only a few hundred meter away from the main headquarters of the PA security force in the city . It is also located not far from the notorious Jericho Prison , where the Palestinian security force often hold Palestinians suspected of being affiliated with Hamas and PIJ.The PA leadership , which recently decided to halt security coordination with Israel in response to the killing of nine Palestinians , mostly gunman , during a similar Israeli security operation in Jenin Refugee Camp , on Monday condemned the & ldquo ; new crime & rdquo ; in Aqbat Jaber camp . In a statement issued by Abbas & rsquo ; s office , the PA accused the Israeli government of continuing it & ldquo ; crime & rdquo ; against the Palestinians.Hours before the incident in Aqbat Jaber camp , Abbas chaired a meeting of the commander of the Palestinian security force and discussed with them the ongoing tension and violence , especially in the West Bank.At the meeting , Abbas reportedly reaffirmed the Palestinian leadership & rsquo ; s decision to end the security coordination with Israel . In the same breath , he also instructed the Palestinian security service & ldquo ; to assume their role in preserving the rule of law , public security and civil peace . & rdquo ; This wa not the first time in recent month that Abbas ha issued such instruction to his security forces.Yet , despite the instruction , the PA security force have failed to take significant action against armed group and gunman in Jenin and Nablus , who continue to operate freely in area under his control and carry out attack against Israeli soldier and civilian . And there & rsquo ; s no reason whatsoever to think that these security force will now take meaningful measure to stop Jericho from joining Jenin and Nablus a terror hub in the West Bank .","is jericho the next palestinian terror hub after jenin , nablus ?"

The confrontation erupted late Thursday evening in a densely populated residential area where terrorist were using civilian cover to evade capture.The intense firefight , which lasted more than 12 hour , resulted in the critical injury of an elite IDF commando . Medical team at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva are currently battling to save his life . The operation wa led by Menashe Brigade Commander Lt . - Col .

2024-06-23 23:31:40.580,jpost,"In his first interview in Hebrew medium since the outbreak of war , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insinuated that threat by protester against his government & rsquo ; s judicial reform to stop serving in the IDF reserve played a part in Hamas & rsquo ; s decision to attack Israel on October 7 . & ldquo ; The refusal [ to serve ] is a disaster & ndash ; and created illusion for our enemy , & rdquo ; the prime minister said during the interview on Channel 14.Netanyahu also criticized current protester calling for an election . & ldquo ; I say to the protester & ndash ; get it together . This is the time for unity , this is the time for greatness . Their goal is to bring down the government , and every time their excuse is different . I do not think that it reflects a majority of the people . I turn to the majority of the people and say & ndash ; this is the time for unity , & rdquo ; the prime minister said.Addressing the four different warning by the IDF during the period of the judicial reform that the social upheaval they had created wa a danger to national security , Netanyahu said he himself had made similar warning in real time and did not need the IDF warning to tell him that . The prime minister added that the IDF assessment prior to October 7 wa that Hamas wa & ldquo ; deterred , and therefore he wa unaware of the threat of the massacre.Netanyahu added that while he believed that every person who wa in a position of authority on October 7 bared & ldquo ; some responsibility , & rdquo ; now wa not the time to form a national committee of investigation , since it would & ldquo ; add to the [ heavy ] load & rdquo ; of running the war.Netanyahu criticizes Gantz and EisenkotThe prime minister also voiced harsh criticism of Benny Gantz and fellow National Unity MK Gadi Eisenkot for leaving the government on June 9 , after joining it day after the October 7 massacre . Gantz and Eisenkot said that they had decided to depart after the prime minister began taking into account personal political consideration while making decision regarding the war . & ldquo ; Gantz and Eisenkot did something that is not done & ndash ; leaving the government in war time , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said . Asked about their claim , the prime minister responded , & ldquo ; And they do not have political consideration ? My consideration is to ensure the safety of Israel . & rdquo ; Netanyahu invited other party currently in the opposition to join the government in Gantz and Eisenkot & rsquo ; s place.In an odd moment in the interview , Netanyahu repeated a misleading claim that the bill to draft haredi into the IDF that is currently being processed in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee ( FADC ) will bring & ldquo ; many thousand & rdquo ; of haredi men into the IDF.The bill , a it currently stand , includes a gradual increase of haredi draftee per year , from the current 1,000 or so per year to approximately 35 % of each graduating class & ndash ; roughly 5,000 men & ndash ; per year in 2036 . The number would not rise significantly in the coming year , and the sanction for haredi yeshivot that do not meet their quota are directed against the yeshivot themselves but not at the individual who avoid the draft . This is widely regarded a insufficient to lead to real change.Netanyahu said that he expected opposition leader MK Yair Lapid and Gantz to support the bill , a it passed it first reading under their government in 2022 . However , a significant portion of Knesset member from Netanyahu & rsquo ; s own Likud party , the entire opposition , and the Defense Ministry have all said that the law wa no longer relevant to the IDF & rsquo ; s need post October 7.Netanyahu & rsquo ; s remark on the haredi bill were surprising , a many member of the Likud , including those who have not expressed opposition to the bill a it currently stand , have said that it wa only a preliminary version . This led to widespread belief that Netanyahu himself wa open to a more sweeping version of the bill , closer to what many see a the bare minimum to meet the IDF & rsquo ; s need & ndash ; to reach a 50 % draft rate of haredi men within five years.The haredi party are unlikely to accept such a version of the bill , and may opt to attempt to topple the government rather than pas it . The issue of the haredi draft is thus viewed a a litmus test for the prime minister & ndash ; whether he act in the national interest or give preference to the survival of his coalition . & nbsp ;","judicial reform protester partly to blame for hamas massacre , netanyahu hint"

They sometimes showcased music and dance , using visual richness to highlight the music , and often their film were very funny in a quintessentially British way.The movie they made together include The Red Shoes , the fantastic and larger-than-life story of a ballerina ( played by real-life ballet dancer Moira Shearer ) who must choose between love and dancing , which became the favorite film of a generation of dance-loving little girls.Their opera adaptation , Tales of Hoffmann , feature evocative cinematography that make the drama of the opera music come to life in a way that influenced Scorsese to become a director , a he explains in the film.They had a few year making British propaganda film to help morale during World War II , including The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp , a gentle comedy-romance that celebrated British sweetness and eccentricity . In addition , they made the quirky romance I Know Where I & rsquo ; m Going ! set on an island off the Scottish coast , and many other movie of British life that were unlike anything made by any other filmmakers.Focus of David Hinton 's documentaryThe documentary , directed by David Hinton , deal with their working relationship , in which Pressburger , who didn & rsquo ; t speak English till he wa in his 30 , outlined the intricate screenplay and created the character , while Powell wrote the dialogue and handled most on-the-set directing chores.Scorsese seems more interested in Powell and his revolutionary visual flourish and paint Pressburger a the more & ldquo ; practical & rdquo ; of the partner , who saw the value in compromising with studio who tried to rein in their vision.The movie doesn & rsquo ; t examine Pressburger & rsquo ; s life a a Jewish refugee and his loss of family member , nor doe it consider how these experience might have led him to a more practical approach to his filmmaking career . But it doe detail how their partnership wa a deep and emotionally charged a any marriage.The movie portrays their breakup a sad , but their love and respect for each other stayed strong , and , after a period when they were virtually forgotten , they later enjoyed recognition for their achievement , spearheaded by a younger generation of filmmaker such a Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola.Those who are interested in a more detailed look at Pressburger & rsquo ; s life would be advised to track down the 1995 documentary The Making of an Englishman , which wa directed by his grandson Kevin Macdonald ( The Last King of Scotland ) and produced by another grandson , Andrew Macdonald ( the producer of Trainspotting ) . While they knew their grandfather , he wa a distant if admired figure in their life , but his love of and filmmaking talent were passed down.The Making of an Englishman spends quite a bit of time on his early life , showing how , after leaving Hungary for Germany , he had to sleep in the park while trying to break into the German film industry , one of the most developed in the world at the time . It also show the difficult moment when he realized he had to flee the Nazi regime and his decision to , a the title suggests , make himself into an English director who had a sensibility a British a any native-born Englishman .

2024-04-19 17:00:25.063,jpost,"There wa something about the story of the murder of a mother and two daughter during the Passover holiday last year that imprinted itself on the consciousness of the nation and catapulted Rabbi Leo Dee , the grieving husband and father , to international prominence.On April 7 , 2023 , Lucy Dee and her daughter Maia , 20 , and Rina , 15 , were driving to Tiberias over Hol Hamoed , the intermediate day of the week-long festival . Their vehicle wa rammed off the road by terrorist gunman , who shot all three woman . Maia and Rina were killed on the scene , and Lucy passed away from her wound two day later.In a private ceremony exactly one year later , Rabbi Leo Dee and his daughter Keren and Tali and son Yehuda ( now 19 , 18 and 15 year old ) dedicated a new social hall in their community of Efrat in Lucy ’ s memory.Later that evening , a standing-room-only crowd of 700 , plus 2,400 who watched the ceremony online , gathered in the newly dedicated Shirat Lucy ( Lucy ’ s Song ) Hall above the Mishkan Tziporah synagogue in Efrat to remember the three woman and to draw inspiration from their lives.Rabbi Leo Dee speaksAfter thanking the attendee for “ the abundance of love , help , positive wish , and kindness from everyone this year , ” Rabbi Dee called these collective act of kindness “ our greatest nechama [ comfort ] . ” In his talk , Rabbi Dee highlighted what he identified a “ some of the thousand of project that have been set off during this year in their memory by friend , family , and people we have never met before ! ” He spoke about the Torah scroll written in Lucy ’ s memory , “ with every one of the 300,000 letter written by different schoolchildren , soldier , and others from around the world … . This sefer Torah is the essence of Lucy ’ s quest to get every Jew to feel part of our greater story and to shine their light in the world . ” In a widely publicized follow-up story to the murder , seven people received one of Lucy ’ s organ . In the audience that night wa Rina Lital , the recipient of Lucy Dee ’ s heart . While relating all the way that Rina ’ s life ha begun to mirror Lucy ’ s since the transplant , Rabbi Dee said , “ The head of organ donation at Beilinson [ Hospital , Rabin Medical Center , Petah Tikvah ] recently announced on national radio that the 30 % increase in organ donor in Israel is directly connected to Lucy ’ s story . ” Continuing the theme of saving life , Rabbi Dee said that “ group of extremely generous Swiss and American donor , who had never met any of u , dedicated a number of ambulance in [ Lucy ’ s ] memory and in the memory of Rina and Maia . They have saved numerous life since then . ” Dressed in matching white T-shirts , the student and faculty of Efrat ’ s Orot Yehuda , where Lucy wa a much-loved English teacher , recorded a haunting video of song of encouragement and faith dedicated to Lucy ’ s memory . The five-minute video garnered more than 43,000 view in it first four days.In Maia ’ s memory , ten of thousand of Jews around the world are learning and discussing a teaching from Pirkei Avot ( Ethics of the Fathers ) at their Shabbat table each week . The project started 18 month ago , when the Dees hosted two of Maia ’ s friend from London . On that Shabbat , they learned one mishna from Pirkei Avot at each meal . In Maia ’ s memory , those friend expanded the project to the extent that Rabbi Dee commented , “ I can not travel anywhere today without people coming up to me and saying , ‘ I am learning your Pirkei Avot . ’ ” He also talked about a project that Maia initiated during her National Service in a high school in Yeroham . She provided snack to encourage girl to study the weekly Torah portion during their morning break . Maia named the project “ Nish Nosh Parsh ” and , according to Rabbi Dee , the project “ ha now been rolled out to hundred of ulpanot across Israel in her memory . ” Rabbi Dee shared that Rina ’ s friendly and adventurous nature ha been memorialized in “ a trip to Masada for hundred of teen from around the country before Pesach . They are planning to build a spring for [ Rina ] in Hamra over the summer . “ Rina , if there wa a girl in your year feeling lonely , you were the one with your arm around her , and you were the one who would start a new ball game to include her , ” her father said . “ To remember your kindness , your friend have built a special space in the school at Kiryat Arba to bring everyone together during break time and for Mincha [ afternoon prayer ] ( which you inspired everyone to daven ) , and they have dedicated a new chug of basketball , to which everyone is invited and will keep everyone fit . ” Future plan include a new youth house for Ezra in the Tamar neighborhood of Efrat in memory of Rina , who wa instrumental in helping to establish the Tamar branch.Speaking directly to his wife and daughter , Dee concluded his summary of memorial project with the word , “ Lucy , Maia , and Rina – you will never be forgotten . Everything I am doing is dedicated to one of you , and so many project continue in your merit . ” The rabbi peppered his evening ’ s talk with the question , “ Mi kamocha , Yisrael ? ” ( Who is like you , Israel ? ) , highlighting the many way that he ha been inspired by the Jewish people ’ s response to his family ’ s tragedy . He concluded with seven lesson he ha drawn from the past year.These were his exact word : There ’ s no benefit to being sad . I believe that the purpose of mourning is to get to a point where you can remember your loved one with a smile ; otherwise , we ’ ll never want to think about them at all . The challenge is figuring out how to do it . With the help of all these project and more , Am Yisrael [ the Nation of Israel ] ha been the greatest help.There ’ s nothing like the Jewish people . From the shiva [ week-long mourning period ] onwards , we have felt that we did not lose three member of our family of seven , but three from our family of 14 million.Tzaddikim [ righteous people ] live forever : They never die . Rashaim [ evil people ] never live , even when they are alive . This also applies to nation . The Jewish people from all past generation are still living through their contribution to our life today . Our enemy have contributed nothing but destruction and are forgettable even while they live.I ’ m grateful for the 30 year I knew Lucy , the 20 year I knew Maia , and the 15 year I knew Rina . Your impact on this world is immeasurable . What you have achieved in half a lifetime , or quarter of a lifetime , is more than most of u could achieve in 10 lifetime . It ’ s a challenge to always think of the good time , but that ’ s what ’ s needed.The best treatment for destruction is to build . The first mitzvah of the Shulchan Aruch [ Code of Jewish Law ] is to jump out of bed in the morning like a lion . This mean : You must have something to jump out of bed for . Every Jew must have at least one passion he or she is working on at any time , and that ’ s what get you up in the morning . If you are struggling to get out of bed , find your passion . Friday morning , planting fruit tree in Efrat wa fulfilling the biblical mitzvah of Yishuv Ha ’ Aretz , settling the land . We will continue to build , we will continue to plant.There ’ s no youth like our Jewish youth . They have get up and go , they build , they invent , and they are the bravest generation in our history . I am proud of every one of them . They are the or le ’ goy [ light unto the nation ] . At the shiva , some 17-year-old boy from the community asked if they could build a viewpoint [ lookout ] in Efrat in memory of the girl , and I apparently agreed . Nine month later , they showed me what they had achieved – and the Mitzpeh HaDegel [ Flag Outlook ] would be a victory for a professional landscape company , let alone a group of 17-year-old boy who raised the fund themselves and taught themselves how to build pergola and plant tree from YouTube videos.Finally , I learned that what matter is not my emunah in Hashem , my faith in God , but rather Hashem ’ s faith in me . Every morning I say “ Modeh Ani … Rabah Emunatecha ” Thank you , Hashem , for Your faith in me . We can appreciate the infinite miracle in our life – the friend , the family , Am Yisrael , Eretz Yisrael [ the Land of Israel ] – but if Hashem agreed for u to wake up this morning , He ha a purpose for u . Our job is not to question Him but to find that purpose . Today there are hundred of thousand of Jews in Israel fighting for our people and for freedom in the world – fulfilling their purpose , and million of others are supporting them.The daughter speakGathered together for strength and support , the three remaining Dee child ascended the platform , where both daughter spoke about their mother and sister . At the evening event , Keren and Tali , who are fully bilingual , spoke in Hebrew ; at the memorial ceremony at the cemetery in Kfar Etzion the next morning , they delivered their comment in English.Keren revealed the truth about living post-trauma by contrasting her daily reality with what she described a “ the beautiful image I built for myself from the outside . ” “ At night , every thought and feeling that come to mind keep switching to difficult thing . I am flooded with memory ; tossing and turning over and over and unable to sleep . At about five , I get out of bed in despair and decide to spend the remaining time ‘ til morning on my phone . ” She then recounted what her day would be like if her mother and sister were still alive , including a poignant image of finding her mother in the kitchen baking “ some indulgent chocolate banana muffin that we could take with u ; and reminding u , of course , that it ’ s important to put on sunscreen so we don ’ t have wrinkle and to drink a lot because it ’ s hot today . ” Keren mused about the “ Orphan ’ s Kaddish ” she find in her prayerbook and how she realized , with a start , that this memorial prayer now refers to her . She concluded with a thought she learned from her father that she said “ help me continue . ” “ What if our life wa supposed to look like this ? What if God predestined an allotted time for them to be with u ? For 18 year ? And then we were meant to go on alone ? ” she asked . “ And then I ask myself , if I had the option and I knew that my life would look like this from the beginning , would I take it or give it up ? “ Everything in life that made me who I am today , I learned from them , ” Keren said . “ Mummy : If it ’ s doing hessed [ act of kindness ] , giving , caring , cooking like crazy , forgiving , being a listening ear but always remembering that there is something more to aspire to and to move forward , then that ’ s what she ’ ll do . “ Maia : Demanding what you deserved , dressing in style , giving good advice , putting effort into what is important to you , loving the Torah , and always listening to others . “ Rina : Loving this country , being righteous with complete faith that this is the way , being humble , loving and believing that everyone ha something special of their own . “ In short , of course I would choose life ! “ Mummy , Maia , and Rina , I believe that you are still by my side in every dilemma I have , every new beginning , in every frustration and in every achievement . Thank you for being with me during the most beautiful 18 year of my life , and now I must move on : not by replacing you , or forgetting you , but with you by my side and above . ” TALI , the younger Dee sister , spoke about all the time , place , and circumstance when she miss her mother and sisters.In a heartrending admission , Tali shared that “ I don ’ t have a mother ’ s voice in my life . There is no one to wake me up in the morning and push me out of bed . Everyone want to make it easy for me , they tell me to [ have ] compassion on myself – but I often just need your demanding voice . I miss your hug . There is nothing in the world that can replace it . And no human being can fill that place . Someone who will take me with my temper , to whom I can show all my hard side – and no matter what , you will always love me . ” Moving from the personal to the national , she said , “ And during this year , our nation ha also turned upside down . After the attack [ on October 7 ] , I thought a lot about the difference between soldier who knowingly put themselves at risk , and my family , who just wanted to go on holiday . “ But I understood that we chose to live here in this country . And we were always aware of the danger present in this choice . The home front and the battle front are close to each other in our country , ” Tali said . “ Many people are now experiencing what I experienced and I want to tell them it get easier , but I ’ m not sure I can say that . There are day when I really manage to be happy . But there is no pill that can cure the pain ; there is no pill that fix everything . “ … I ’ m not the same person after everything that happened to me .

2021-04-30 00:56:04.673,jpost,"Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced on Thursday night that the Palestinian election have been postponed until Israel allows the vote to take place in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Abbas made the announcement after a meeting of leader of Palestinian faction in Ramallah . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We have decided to postpone the parliamentary election until we ensure the participation of the people of Jerusalem , & rdquo ; Abbas said in a statement . & ldquo ; The election must be held in all the Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; He said that he will work toward forming a Palestinian national unity government that would & ldquo ; abide by international resolution and reinforce the PLO . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Earlier in the night , Abbas announced that Israel ha informed the Palestinian Authority that it will not allow the Palestinians to hold election in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; There will be no election without Jerusalem , & rdquo ; Abbas said in opening remark during a meeting of leader of several Palestinian faction in Ramallah . & nbsp ; The meeting wa called amid report that Abbas wa set to announce the postponement of the election indefinitely because of Israel & rsquo ; s reported refusal to allow the vote to take place in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; He said that the US , European Union and some Arab country also informed the Palestinians of Israel & rsquo ; s refusal to allow the election to take place in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Today , we received a message from Israel , the US and some Arab country about Israel & rsquo ; s opposition to holding the election in Jerusalem , & rdquo ; Abbas said . & ldquo ; The message we received said that Israel can @ @ @ t make a decision because there is no government in Israel . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Scoffing at the purported Israeli response , Abbas said : & ldquo ; But there is a government in Israel that is making decision to build thousand of settlement . Who issued the order to the [ Israel ] police to stand with the settler in killing the people of Jerusalem ? Where did these decision came from ? Africa ? We won & rsquo ; t allow anyone to fool u . This is nonsense . Where is [ Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu ? Netanyahu , may God prolong his life , is still the prime minister . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Abbas said that the Palestinians are ready to hold the election once Israel agrees to allow the vote to take place in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We want the election to take place in Jerusalem , and not in Abu Dis , & rdquo ; he said , referring to a West Bank village south of Jerusalem . & ldquo ; For u , the election are not a tactic or a game . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Abbas said that the EU made a big effort to exert pressure on Israel to allow the election to take place in Jerusalem , but to no avail . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; When we announced the election , the Europeans told u that they support u and are ready to help u achieve our goal , & rdquo ; he noted . & ldquo ; I told the Europeans that that Israel will not agree to hold the election in Jerusalem . They told me that they will talk to the Israelis about this . We also asked the Americans where are they , but we didn & rsquo ; t hear from them . We waited and didn & rsquo ; t receive a response . We also sent our foreign minister to Europe to tell them we are running out of time . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; According to Abbas , the head of the EU told him that they were & ldquo ; frustrated & rdquo ; by Israel & rsquo ; s refusal to respond to the request to hold the election in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Abbas accused Israel of & ldquo ; beating & rdquo ; Palestinian candidate in Jerusalem and preventing election gathering . & nbsp ; He went on to praise the resident of east Jerusalem for protesting Israeli security restriction in the city in the past three week . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I want to praise the great stance of our people in Jerusalem and the Arab people who stood with u regarding the event in Jerusalem in the past few week , & rdquo ; Abbas said . & ldquo ; There is a great people in Jerusalem capable of saying no to the occupation . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; He accused the Israeli government of supporting Jewish extremist who chanted & quot ; Death to the Arabs & quot ; during a recent demonstration near the Old City of Jerusalem . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Referring to the removal of the police barricade from Damascus Gate & ndash ; which reportedly triggered the clash in the city & ndash ; Abbas said : & ldquo ; Jerusalem belongs to u ; our brother managed to remove the barricade that prevented them from moving and working in the city . They launched a peaceful , popular resistance . This is the only way to confront this aggression on our people . Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Palestine . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Earlier this week , Foreign Ministry political adviser Alon Bar told European ambassador that Israel wa not interfering with the scheduled Palestinian election . & ldquo ; Israel will not prevent the election in the Palestinian Authority from happening , & rdquo ; Bar said . The Palestinian election are an internal Palestinian matter , and Israel will not intervene , he added . & nbsp ; Hamas official said they did not participate in the meeting of the faction leader because they received an invitation only at the last minute . & ldquo ; Hamas & rsquo ; s position is clear : we reject the postponement of the election and we will not provide a cover for such a decision , & rdquo ; said Mohammed Subha , a spokesperson for the Hamas electoral list & ldquo ; Jerusalem is Our Destiny . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Subha warned that postponement of the election would have a negative impact on effort to end the rivalry between Hamas and Fatah . He also hinted that the move could trigger widespread protest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . & nbsp ; Hours before the meeting , thousand of Palestinians demonstrated in the Gaza Strip to voice opposition to the cancellation of the election . & nbsp ; Some of the protest were organized by supporter of exiled Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan , an archrival of Abbas . Dahlan loyalist have formed an electoral list called Al-Mustaqbal ( Future ) to contest the parliamentary election . & nbsp ; Nayrouz Qarmout , a spokeswoman for Al-Mustaqbal , pointed out that 25 electoral list running in the parliamentary election were opposed to the cancellation of the vote . & ldquo ; No one ha the right to postpone the election , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; Only those who are afraid of the result don & rsquo ; t want election . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Qarmout and other Palestinians predicted that the cancellation of the election would intensify the dispute between Fatah and Hamas . & nbsp ; In a joint statement , the electoral list warned that the cancellation of the election would be a & ldquo ; constitutional crime . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The cancellation of the election is a new and big catastrophe for the Palestinians , & rdquo ; said Abdel Hakim Awad , a senior official with Dahlan & rsquo ; s Democratic Reform Current movement . & ldquo ; It will have dire effect and serious consequence on the Palestinian people . The election are a light at the end of the tunnel in order to unify the Palestinian people and end the division [ between the West Bank and Gaza Strip ] . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The decision to hold the election wa part of an agreement reached between Fatah , Hamas and 12 other Palestinian faction . & nbsp ; The agreement , reached under the auspex of Egypt , called for boosting public freedom in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , including the immediate release of detainee held by the PA and Hamas and non-interference by the Palestinian security force in the electoral process . & nbsp ; The agreement wa reached after month of negotiation , which began in July 2020 between Fatah and Hamas leader in Turkey , Qatar and Egypt . & nbsp ; In accordance with the agreement , Abbas issued a decree on January 15 for holding the first general election since 2006 , when Hamas won the parliamentary vote . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The Palestinian people in Jerusalem and all constituency of the nation are invited to general , free and direct election to elect member of the Palestinian Legislative Council ( PLC ) on May 22 , 2021 and President of the State of Palestine on July 31 , 2021 , & rdquo ; Abbas said in the decree . & nbsp ; According to the decree , the PLC election shall be considered the first stage for the election of the Palestinian National Council ( PNC ) , the PLO & rsquo ; s legislative body . The formation of the PNC shall be completed on August 31 , 2021 . & nbsp ; The Palestinian Central Elections Commission said that 36 electoral list submitted their nomination application for the PLC election , including 29 independent list and seven from political party . The number of candidate nominated for the 132-member PLC reached 1,391 , including 405 woman .",abbas : palestinian election postponed after israel block jerusalem vote
2021-04-08 17:00:50.617,jpost,"& nbsp ; On April 7 , 2011 , a new era began for Israel & rsquo ; s air and missile defense force & ndash ; when the Iron Dome missile defense system completed it first successful operational interception against a short-range threat originating from the Gaza Strip . & nbsp ; Now , one decade later , it is time to analyze the decision-making process behind the system & rsquo ; s development , some lesson learned from a decade of operation , and the prospect for further advancement and adaptation over the next decade , including potential future connection with laser solution . & nbsp ; Iron Dome & rsquo ; s unrivaled success on the battlefield & ndash ; which ha even made it , in many people & rsquo ; s eye , the most important Israeli innovation in the country & rsquo ; s 70 year of existence & ndash ; ha produced countless article , interview , book and television program on the path to develop the system and it progress over the year . & nbsp ; For the sake of history , those who made the decision and developed the system , and for the purpose of drawing effective lesson for the future , it is essential that the record be set straight , and that the factual truth , albeit subjective , be known , a it primarily appears in the State Comptroller & rsquo ; s report 59A . & nbsp ; Deciding to develop Iron Dome & nbsp ; In 1996 , Israel and the United States agreed to collaborate on Project THEL ( Tactical High-Energy Laser ) , mistakenly dubbed Nautilus ( America & rsquo ; s earlier adventure in this technological field ) . From the start , the project wa developed a a technological demonstrator . In 2001 , a series of test wa completed proving a laser beam can intercept a threat , but concluded that a chemical laser-based interception system wa not suitable for operational deployment in Israel . Low operational preparedness ( technological reliability ) , complex logistics ( size , availability , repair and transfer from site to site ) and environmental concern were only a few of the many significant reason why . & nbsp ; Israel and the US decided to plan another system , smaller and more portable , named MTHEL ( Mobile THEL ) . From this decision , it can be understood that the cessation of the THEL program wa not in any way caused by Israel & rsquo ; s exit from Lebanon , a some have argued . & nbsp ; From 2001 to 2005 , Israel and it American counterpart worked on the new collaboration but decided to discontinue it in 2005 while still in the planning stage , a per advice from the Defense Ministry & rsquo ; s Directorate of Defense Research and Development ( DDR & amp ; D ) director Shmuel Keren and assessment shared by numerous expert . It wa believed this project would not lead to an operational weapon system given that there wa no foreseeable future for a chemical laser-based system . It wa clear that any future laser-based interception system would be based on a solid-state laser , but such technology would not be available for & ndash ; what proved to be optimistic & ndash ; at least another decade . & nbsp ; In the end , by 2005 , after roughly nine year of work and $ 600 million ( mostly funded by the US ) , the outcome wa a technological demonstrator , impossible to duplicate or be used operationally on an American test field . Over the year , a series of interception test wa conducted on the system with an actual success rate of less than 50 % ( based on American official data ) . & nbsp ; Additionally , a detailed on-paper plan wa designed for a small mobile system , MTHE . The idea , later dubbed SKYGUARD , wa not yet created . SKYGUARD & rsquo ; s status can also be deduced from a Northrop Grumman ( NG ) proposal submitted to DDR & amp ; D down the road . The proposal required higher development cost than all of Iron Dome & rsquo ; s development from zero . Statements contending that the THEL system could have been brought to Israel and operationalized , or that the MTHEL/SKYGUARD system wa ready for production in 2005 were simply not factually accurate nor based in reality . This remains the case today , 15 year later . & nbsp ; In 2004 & ndash ; facing elevated threat , especially in southern Israel & ndash ; an interagency team wa set up to draft solution for defensive system against short-range threat . This team , led by R & amp ; D unit director Daniel Gold , issued a call for proposal and tested dozen of potential solution . Eventually , at the end of 2005 , the team recommended developing a system based on Rafael & rsquo ; s proposal ( with change ) & ndash ; and it wa named & ldquo ; Iron Dome . & rdquo ; The proposal wa approved by DDR & amp ; D director Keren and a relatively small budget wa allocated , out of the department & rsquo ; s overall budget , and a partnership with Rafael that financially support part of the R & amp ; D effort . & nbsp ; In 2006 , in light of the changing threat landscape & ndash ; with the Second Lebanon War and rocket launched into Israel serving a significant catalyst & ndash ; and inquiry by NG and other defense industry , Keren presented the proposed concept to then-defense minister Amir Peretz , recommending Iron Dome . Peretz adopted the suggestion and even called for expedited development . However , there still wa not a significant budget allocated to the project , & nbsp ; In October 2006 , after additional significant pressure , Keren appointed a professional committee led by his deputy Jacob Nagel , to test which solution would best protect Israel from short-range missile threat . The committee included dozen of internal and external expert in the field of missile , laser , operational research and doctrine . Lt . - Col . Shachar Shohat & ndash ; who later achieved the rank of brigadier-general and served a commander of the Air Defense Forces & ndash ; served a the Air Force representative on the committee . & nbsp ; For three month , the Nagel Committee worked intensely to test all potential Israeli and international solution . Finally , in December , the committee presented it finding and recommendation to Keren , to Defense Ministry director-general Gabi Ashkenazi and to Peretz , and they approved it . In February 2007 , these recommendation were presented to prime minister Ehud Olmert , who authorized them . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s state comptroller noted , & ldquo ; DDR & amp ; D , through the work of the Nagel Committee , conducted an orderly process for testing alternative , and presented the alternative to different party and noted the clear advantage with the Iron Dome system . Each of the party & ndash ; the director-general , minister of defense , and prime minister & ndash ; approved DDR & amp ; D & rsquo ; s conclusion . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Peretz declared that the Iron Dome concept wa proven , but would require additional external funding . Olmert explained that Iron Dome & rsquo ; s development wa unavoidable and directed the Defense Ministry to approach the Finance Ministry to allocate the needed budget . By June 2007 the project still had not received a substantial budget , and progressed with DDR & amp ; D and Rafael R & amp ; D budget , increased by several dozen of million of shekel from Peretz and acting director-general Yehiel Horev from the defense budget . & nbsp ; The Nagel Committee did not include the THEL system a a potential solution , given previous assessment casting doubt on it operational potential or relevance , and the inability to be duplicated . SKYGUARD , NG & rsquo ; s solution , wa examined in detail . During the process , NG & rsquo ; s VP met with the DDR & amp ; D director and thanked him & ndash ; in writing and in person & ndash ; for the opportunity to present the proposal to the committee . & nbsp ; In 2007 , upon taking office and facing lingering tension , defense minister Ehud Barak convened yet another hearing , calling for a re-presentation of the Nagel Committee finding and recommendation on each of the proposed solution , including another external presentation of the SKYGUARD system . Barak then ratified these recommendation , declared development of Iron Dome a essential , and allocated the needed budget out of the Defense Ministry budget . & nbsp ; Following this approval , final negotiation were conducted with Rafael , the project wa submitted to the government , and it wa officially approved . In December 2007 , Rafael signed a contract with the Israeli government for the development and equipping of the first two Iron Dome battery . & nbsp ; From this point , development of the project wa expedited by Rafael , ELTA and M-Prest under a DDR & amp ; D project team , led by then-Lt . - Col . Chicco with the close guidance of R & amp ; D director Gold . & nbsp ; Simultaneously , an unprecedented lobbying campaign for SKYGUARD kicked off , drafting senior retired military officer , academic and medium figure . This campaign led to serious incitement , with personal attack lobbed at director-general Pinhas Buchris , DDR & amp ; D director Keren and his deputy Nagel , who were dubbed the & ldquo ; high-priests of Iron Dome & rdquo ; by the campaign . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The lobby & rsquo ; s effort included drafting PR expert , distributing marketing brochure , pushing defamation both online and in newspaper , and planning an approach to key US figure in an effort to harm the State of Israel . This wa revealed in article by Channel 11 & rsquo ; s Ayala Hasson and Channel 10 & rsquo ; s Raviv Drucker . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Buchris , Keren and Nagel were at the forefront of defending the decision to develop Iron Dome , while Gold and his team were working on developing the system with the industry . They held dozen of meeting with the leader of Israel & rsquo ; s northern and southern community , minister , MKs , member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee , and member of the press and academia . Upon reviewing the factual data and decision-making process , almost every one of these individual understood that they had been fed nothing but misinformation , and withdrew their support of the lobbying campaign . & nbsp ; As part of his effort to defend the project , Buchris ( with Nagel ) traveled a part of a professional delegation to the US to see the THEL system in New Mexico . They met with representative from NG and with relevant member of the US military who explained that the decision to stop development of the project wa reached in consultation with Israel . Buchris returned to Israel more convinced than ever that the THEL system wa not relevant , and they were completely in support of the decision-making process . & nbsp ; In 2008 , Barak met with US secretary of defense Robert Gates , and they discussed way the US could support Israel in it attempt to protect the home front from high-trajectory missile . This wa largely motivated by America & rsquo ; s desire to prevent Israel from entering a war with Gaza . As a result of these meeting , a joint committee led by DDR & amp ; D & rsquo ; s Nagel and US Gen . Robin Rand wa formed to once again test each of the possible solution ( Iron Dome , SKYGUARD , Vulcan Planks and other proposed laser system ) . Again the conclusion wa reached that only Iron Dome could sufficiently supply the defense needed for Israel & rsquo ; s home front , while providing it leader the freedom to act a needed . & nbsp ; The Nagel-Rand committee again determined that the SKYGUARD system , still only on paper , wa not a suitable solution & ndash ; either for Israel or the US . As part of this committee , a delegation of US missile , radar , command and control , and laser expert arrived in Israel , conducted in-depth discussion and visited both DDR & amp ; D and the Israeli defense industry . While the first visit started with marked skepticism surrounding the feasibility of developing the system , it ended with admiration for the system , but with expectation that the project would not be completed on time or within budget . Yet one year later during a subsequent visit , the delegation wa enthralled by the pace of Iron Dome & rsquo ; s development and advancement in solving technical problem . They released a professional report , optimistic on the project & rsquo ; s success and keeping to the projected schedule and budget . & nbsp ; The Nagel-Rand Committee recommendation were presented to and subsequently approved by Keren , Buchris and Barak . They were then presented to relevant American stakeholder and resulted in then-president Barack Obama allocating $ 205 million in special assistance to the program . A central element of the committee & rsquo ; s proposal insisted that assistance be limited to equipping the Iron Dome system in an effort to prevent any future potential export restriction on the system and ensure development remained & ldquo ; blue and white & rdquo ; in it entirety . & nbsp ; In the decade following that decision , the US significantly increased it financial contribution to equipping additional Iron Dome system and launcher . Included in the 2016 Memorandum of Understanding between the US and Israel , pushed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Obama ( which entered into force in fiscal year 2019 ) , a new , special section wa added allocating $ 500 million annually to ballistic missile defense , with the equipping of Iron Dome component being an important component thereof . & nbsp ; The past decade & ndash ; analysis and lesson learned & nbsp ; Today , the Iron Dome missile defense system is highly regarded in professional , political , military and civilian circle both in Israel and abroad , and ha received numerous prize and praise for it groundbreaking military innovation and success in saving life . The term & ldquo ; Iron Dome & rdquo ; ha become ingrained in the Hebrew lexicon , synonymous with incredible success . & nbsp ; Despite it operational and technological success , those initial naysayer were not quick to mute themselves or their criticism . At the tactical level , Iron Dome & rsquo ; s operational capability were called into question , while at the strategic level , concern were raised that the damage outweighed any benefit , especially given the negative impact on the national-level decision-making process and international legitimization . & nbsp ; They claimed that Iron Dome , with the passage of time , had become a burden rather than an asset and a double-edged sword . An academic research project conducted at the National Security College , guided by one of the author of this article , analyzed Iron Dome & rsquo ; s impact on the Israeli National Security Strategy & ndash ; economically , militarily , socially and politically . After a decade of operational experience and more than 2,500 successful interception , the research conclusively find that the Iron Dome system is a first-class asset and clear barrier breaker , not remotely resembling a double-edged sword . Iron Dome often change the decision-making process of Israel & rsquo ; s political echelon , and our enemy & rsquo ; method and tactic . & nbsp ; Iron Dome is a key element of Israel & rsquo ; s multi-layered defense array , developed to protect the home front from incoming missile threat . While Iron Dome protects against short-range threat , the David & rsquo ; s Sling system defends against mid-tier threat , and the Arrow system defend against upper-tier threat . & nbsp ; The US Army , facing many threat similar to Israel , decided to procure two Iron Dome battery a an interim solution while deciding what the most appropriate enduring solution would be for it need . Simultaneously , the US Marines also expressed interest in the system and have conducted several successful test in America . & nbsp ; The continued collaboration between Israel and the US in the development and equipping of Iron Dome contributes to strengthening the strategic and technological collaboration between the two country and their defense of their respective civilian and service member . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; AS WE celebrate 10 year since Iron Dome & rsquo ; s first interception , we are reminded of the importance of recalling the overall goal that led decision-makers to develop this system : & bull ; Life and limb : Save life above all else , almost at any cost . & bull ; Strategic asset : Protect strategic facility , military facility and national infrastructure . & bull ; Economic defense : Reduce the amount of direct and indirect economic damage ( cost of property , human casualty and injury ) and prevent interference with the economy and national gross production . & nbsp ; & bull ; Strategic flexibility : Provide additional option to political decision-makers by reducing the risk posed by incoming rocket . & bull ; Ability to act : Increase the military & rsquo ; s freedom to act via the ability to carry out offensive operation free from the fear of retaliatory rocket attack . & bull ; Confidence : Raise the national morale and spirit , decrease the psychological impact on the population caused by image of damage and destruction , especially in the age of social medium . & nbsp ; IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS of relevant event of the past decade lead to determination of success on several level , such a : & bull ; Economic perspective : A review of the past decade & rsquo ; s economic data prof beyond all doubt that Iron Dome certainly stand up to the economic test . This is further supported with the realization that the comparison can not be between the cost of the interceptor and the cost of a missile , but rather the total cost of a launch compared to the direct and indirect economic consequence resulting from incoming enemy missile scoring direct hit . & bull ; Societal Perspective : Iron Dome , a an effective defense system , significantly contributes to Israel & rsquo ; s sense of community and national pride . It contributes to Israel & rsquo ; s degree of resilience by reducing overall level of fear and anxiety , creating a unified home front with all it civilian feeling protected . In the battle over public opinion , the system also contributes to Israel & rsquo ; s story of success over the enemy and improves overall morale both during and after period of combat . However , it is also important to note that the system & rsquo ; s past success creates a danger of an illusion of security to civilian . To prevent such negative surprise , it is essential that our leader set reasonable expectation for citizen . Outlook for the next decade & nbsp ; Over the past decade , Iron Dome provided unprecedented superiority . During the next decade , we can expect enemy will respond with technological effort of their own . All sign suggest they have already started , and thus there is no time to waste . Testing , improvement and adaptation of Iron Dome are constantly required a a way to ensure it maintains it legendary superiority . This is an endless battle in the fight between the threat and the interceptor . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Without getting into specific , it is clear that every system ha limitation and vulnerability . However , if we do not put forth every effort to further it innovation and renewal , our adversary will detract from Iron Dome & rsquo ; s effectiveness and superiority . There is no indefinitely hermetic defensive solution . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; We can not rest on our laurel . We must consistently test the enemy & rsquo ; advancement and threat trend , and adapt our system to achieve optimal effective defense , in order to maintain relevance on the future battlefield . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ONE KEY area of interest is laser-based solution . & nbsp ; During the Iron Dome decision-making process and continuously ever since , baseless allegation have been made related to the performance of laser-based system versus kinetic interception-based system using missile . & nbsp ; Each solution ha advantage and disadvantage that are important to raise and understand . Understanding the pro and con of a laser-based system is especially important today , given the great progress recently made in Israel in technology development . & nbsp ; It is critical to correct some of the factually incorrect argument in favor of transitioning to a laser-based system : & bull ; & ldquo ; A laser-based interception system will prevent disruption to daily life , a it is an almost perfect and hermetic system . & rdquo ; Hermetic system do not exist , and it is clear that with any system , daily routine will be disrupted . In any case , the performance of the missile-based system seems to be better than those based on laser . & bull ; & ldquo ; Laser system will better handle barrage attack . & rdquo ; Actually , the opposite is true and this is one of the most compelling disadvantage to a laser-based system , since such a system & rsquo ; s primary role would be to handle a series of threat . Statements alleging & ldquo ; interception at the speed of light & rdquo ; are misleading . While the beam can reach it target at the speed of light and notably faster than a missile , it must remain on each target for several second to destroy it ( how long can not be revealed ) and largely depends on the threat variant , the strength of the beam and it distance from the target . The laser-based system would be quite limited in it ability to counter attack salvo ( unless it could be built with multiple beam , meaning another system , which would substantially increase the overall cost ) . In multi-purpose missile-based system , the missile are launched independently , are operated simultaneously by the system and operate instantaneously on the target to counter incoming threat . & bull ; & ldquo ; Laser system don & rsquo ; t require adaptation for new threat . & rdquo ; Laser-based system are not robust , and each threat need to be programmed for separately . & nbsp ; ON FEBRUARY 8 , 2020 , the Defense Ministry announced a groundbreaking technological achievement in the development of the solid-state laser . The depth and gravity of this achievement are noteworthy , a is it potential for strengthening Israel & rsquo ; s low tactical defensive layer capability . The correct and planned use of this new technology add to the interception capability in a newer , cheaper way , based on an understanding of it limitation . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; While this is a major advancement that allows for a demonstration of the system & rsquo ; s battlefield capability , the full operational range of the system is still several year and hundred of million of shekel of development away . There is no doubt that the addition of a laser interceptor , alongside the classic Iron Dome interceptor , will improve overall performance and will also be beneficial to Israel & rsquo ; s partner , including the US . & nbsp ; IN SUMMARY , after a decade of operational work of the Iron Dome system , it can be said that we must tip our hat to all those who have worked on this project over the past 15 year , the decision-making stage , development of the system , it integration and it transition into successful operationalization and use , through continuous improvement along the way . & nbsp ; That being said , Iron Dome is not yet complete , and it will likely continue for many year to come . Our enemy are learning the system all the time and without question they never cease to try to surprise u . The role of all those involved is to always be one step ahead of them .

How can the security system deal with this . `` To explain why occasionally there are no siren , Hezbollah learned to operate with UAVs at a low altitude close to the ground . Because of this , the UAV is not identified , and Hezbollah manages to operate them and attack before the Israeli detection and identification system operates . This ha become a challenge for u , but we continue to face Hezbollah a we have in recent year in a symmetrical manner . For every attack they launch at u , we retaliate proportionally . `` This is not how to deal with a terror organization , certainly not at this stage . Hezbollah understands that we are in negotiation over the hostage , and they want to pressure the State of Israel . We must not play into their hand . This is exactly the time to take action against Hezbollah and Lebanon a a country and attack civilian infrastructure . Hezbollah is also subject to social and public pressure within Lebanon . `` Which infrastructure and target are worth it for Israel to attack ? & nbsp ; `` If we do not know how to attack such civilian infrastructure that the Lebanese society will put pressure on Hezbollah , we will not come out of this . We needed to escalate matter long ago .

The economy in Lebanon is so fragile that the last thing they need is escalation and entry into a war from Israel , which will destroy the Lebanese economy.Buskila continued , `` We are at war . Any target within Lebanon that cause pressure on Lebanese society is legitimate . It could be an airport , energy area , and others . These are part of the step taken in war , and we are at war . We are in a fateful year that will determine the future of the State of Israel in term of security in the next 50 year . The sharper this war becomes and the more significant the achievement , the more peace we will acquire in the coming year . `` `` The State of Israel and the security system are afraid to carry out attack for fear that Hezbollah may achieve long-range target , farther than Haifa and Hadera .

This one season felt like three or four year and in addition to what happened with my good friend and coach Lior Lubin who passed away , it wa intense and very complex . Every day there wa something that happened and perhaps my character is sometimes a disadvantage in these situation , but maybe it wa an advantage . & rdquo ; In addition to his own mental make-up , Katash referenced his player & rsquo ; strength . & ldquo ; If we didn & rsquo ; t have continuity in the roster from last year , we wouldn & rsquo ; t have been able to survive this entire situation . We had a tough schedule but we were able to do it with the character of the player and building upon what we had started last season . & rdquo ; The prevailing thought wa that Maccabi would fall apart without it home crowd to cheer it on and a successful Euroleague campaign wa at that point too lofty an expectation . But that wa not the case a the player and staff pulled it together and ended up in seventh place with an impressive 20-14 record , earning it a place in the Play-In . After easily disposing of Baskonia , Panathinaikos wa up next for Maccabi a it took the eventual Euroleague champ to five game before falling in Athens.Local victoryLocally , the yellow-and-blue won game after game in the domestic league throughout the winter month but ended up falling in the State Cup final to Hapoel Jerusalem in a game that took place just day after the club & rsquo ; s continental campaign came to an end . & ldquo ; When you win a title it & rsquo ; s always great , but this season wa extra special after everything we had experienced . After we ended Europe we were really done and we had so many injury and situation that we paid a price for , whether it wa the war or personal issue of the player a well . After we lost the cup , the player really didn & rsquo ; t want to finish this season that way . In some way , everything went against u but we also have to look at thing in proportion a there are still hostage in Gaza . & rdquo ; Katash & rsquo ; s charge pulled it all together in their league quarterfinal series against Ness Ziona , which resulted in a sweep that wa followed up by another walkover versus Jerusalem , which wa without injured star Levi Randolph ( now rumored to be coming to Maccabi ) . Hapoel Tel Aviv looked to avenge last year & rsquo ; s final series loss , but once again the Reds came up short and Maccabi captured yet another title.While the yellow-and-blue can bask in championship glory , the celebration will be short lived a it will need to start rebuilding the roster for the 24/25 season that is right around the corner and there will be plenty of change coming , from both import to Israelis.Baldwin and Brown swiftly declared that they will be leaving the team due to the war , with their announcement coming a they were still on the floor celebrating.Josh Nebo & rsquo ; s contract is up and he will be departing while Bonzie Colson is still undecided a to where he will suit up next season . Baldwin , Brown and Colson all have contract for the 24/25 campaign with Maccabi , but the club will not stand in their way should they want to leave.Katash of course would love for them to all stay but the reality is that they will be heading to other team . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s sad to lose them and break up the team and it & rsquo ; s really sad actually . But what ha occurred here this season in the country , it & rsquo ; s part of the price that we have to pay . What happened on October 7 is the biggest incident that I & rsquo ; ve witnessed in my lifetime and we have to take thing into proportion . & rdquo ; Rivero should be back , and the same may be true of Antonius Cleveland , howevervJames Webb will likely be looking for a new home next season.As for the Israeli contingent , Rafi Menco is a free agent but should return , Josh DiBartoloemo and Jake Cohen are under contract and should be back playing at Yad Eliyahu next season , while Tamir Blatt is opting out of his current contract but will most likely re-sign with the team at a higher rate.The one big question is the league and final MVP , Sorkin . The big man is rumored to be heading to North America to try out for NBA team after a stellar season , but there is also talk that Maccabi will make him an offer that he can & rsquo ; t refuse and he will stay yellow-and-blue for the foreseeable future . & ldquo ; Roman won every award this season , & rdquo ; Katash said . & ldquo ; I have the privilege of coaching him . He can really do it all and ha a huge upside and is one of the most talented player . He & rsquo ; s a great person a well and I & rsquo ; m very proud a to how he came into the playoff . He wa playing well in the Euroleague , but then got hurt and it just took time to get him back up to speed . He need to be a Maccabi Tel Aviv player for the rest of his career . & rdquo ; There are plenty of name that have been linked to Maccabi and while the Euroleague home game will most probably be played once again in Belgrade , the club still remains a very attractive option for some player , explained the bench bos . & ldquo ; Next season won & rsquo ; t be easy and it wa a challenge this year just in term of scheduling . But Maccabi is a big club and ha a system in place and while it won & rsquo ; t be easy to keep player and sign player , we are there . & ldquo ; We know we will lose some player but there are plenty of player who see Maccabi a an opportunity . Maccabi is a good place to play and a place where player can advance their career . & rdquo ; It seems that the yellow-and-blue is doing exactly that , finding player who want to come play for Maccabi that have experienced Israel . Those may include Hapoel Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Randolph , Hapoel Holon big man Justin Smith along with Hapoel Tel Aviv & rsquo ; s center Jaylen Hoard , to name a few.The upcoming campaign will be complex and challenging without a doubt , but the most important thing for Maccabi will be to be able to adapt on the fly and adjust a it did this season . & ldquo ; There are a lot of question mark . In this chaotic reality , it is impossible to know what the day will bring . Things change all the time , we have to adjust ourselves & ndash ; because we are heading into a difficult year . & rdquo ;",katash reflects on maccabi tel aviv ’ s chaotic campaign
2024-04-28 09:47:15.807,jpost,"CONTROVERSY OVER the awarding of the Israel Prize ha not yet subsided . Attorney Batya Kahana Dror recently filed an urgent petition to the High Court of Justice seeking to prevent Sephardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef from receiving the Israel Prize for Torah Literature , which wa announced in March . Kahana Dror & rsquo ; s complaint ha nothing to do with Torah literature , but with Yosef & rsquo ; s remark on the haredi draft , which have been interpreted a encouraging draft-dodging by ultra-Orthodox young men considered eligible for army service . The Movement for Quality Government filed a similar complaint in March , calling for the rabbi & rsquo ; s removal from the Great Rabbinical Court of Appeals in a letter to Uri Shoham , the Israeli judiciary & rsquo ; s ombudsman.The letter accused Yosef of overstepping his role by supporting the attempt to prevent the enactment of legislation that would force ultra-Orthodox youth to perform military service . Yosef wa reported to have said that if there is a change from the status quo whereby exemption from military service will no longer be valid , ultra-Orthodox youth will leave the country in drove . As a public servant who receives his salary from the state , Yosef spoke out of turn , and what he said wa a form of incitement . He ha since stated that he wa misunderstood , but to no avail . There have been call for his ouster and for the retraction of the award . There have also been demonstration against him.As ha happened in the past , the question arises a to whether a person should be judged only for achievement in the category in which he or she ha been named a an Israel Prize winner or whether the awarding of the prize should also be based on that person & rsquo ; s behavior and political and religious view and affiliations.Empty seat on Passover at the Great Synagogue ■ ONE OF the most demoralizing thing that could happen during a pilgrim festival , such a Passover , is to attend service at the majestic Jerusalem Great Synagogue and see that most of the seat are empty.There could be several reason for this.One is that people slept in after the Seder , having gone to bed at midnight or later . Another is that , due to numerous flight cancellation , many of the thousand of evacuee transferred to Jerusalem after October 7 have returned to their home , leaving no tourist to replace them . Yet another is the police warning following the terrorist attack in Jerusalem just ahead of the holiday ; fear may have kept some people at home.But , a always , the inspiring Great Synagogue choir , with it wide vocal range that accompanied Cantor Tzvi Weiss and wa conducted by Elli Jaffe , wa top-notch , even though it & rsquo ; s somewhat disconcerting that Weiss sings in the Ashkenazi pronunciation of Hebrew . Latecomers began to file in after the Bible reading , more so in the men & rsquo ; s section than in the woman & rsquo ; s , but there were still far too many empty seat in both.In nearby France Square , a long , symbolic Seder table had been set with artistically folded yellow paper napkin on each plate , empty wine bottle , and dead flower . Each chair had a large photograph of a hostage , affixed with his or her name , sending a powerful message . The symbolic high chair at the head of the table , which bore the portrait of Kfir Bibas , the youngest of the hostage , wa especially poignant . & nbsp ; The fact that the high chair wa at the head of the table wa reminiscent of the prophet Isaiah & rsquo ; s vision , which , in addition to including the wolf dwelling with the lamb and the leopard with the young goat and the lion , spoke of a small child who would lead them . & nbsp ; Though each and every hostage is equally important , none ha captured a much sympathy a Kfir Bibas , whose first birthday on January 18 wa spent in captivity in Gaza.The venue for the symbolic Seder wa appropriate in that there are synagogue within the distance of a kilometer in all direction , representing most stream of Judaism . Prayers and special psalm for the hostage have been incorporated into synagogue services.Hamas 's hostage video ■ THE VIDEO of Hersh Goldberg-Polin that wa released by Hamas last week and the timing of the release may possibly be attributed to two factor . One is that he is a dual national , holding American and Israeli citizenship , and the other is that his mother , Rachel Goldberg-Polin , wa included in Time Magazine & rsquo ; s list of the 100 most influential people . Goldberg-Polin ha been extremely active in the campaign by hostage family for the return of their loved one to Israel.Unfortunately , because the date of the video is unknown , no one know the true state of Hersh & rsquo ; s health . But what matter is that , hopefully , he & rsquo ; s alive , and unlike so many other parent who have no idea whether their son and daughter are alive , the Goldberg-Polins have at least received a sign , and they can play the video over and over again . It is so terribly important for hostage family to keep getting the word out , not just because they want more people to understand what ha happened and to imagine what it would be like if one of their loved one were captured by Hamas , but because Gilad Shalit had been heartened during his captivity by hearing on the radio that his family and the Israel government had not given up on him . His captor had allowed him to listen to the radio from time to time , which is why the message of relative of the hostage are rebroadcast several time a day , and the message always includes all the hostage , assuring them that the effort for their release are ongoing without let-up.Meanwhile , news of the release of the video , which wa the first sign of life that Hersh Goldberg Polin & rsquo ; s family have received since October 7 , prompted a spontaneous demonstration near the prime minister & rsquo ; s residence in Jerusalem with a demand to resume negotiation for the return of the hostage . The number of demonstrator quickly swelled into the hundred , necessitating police intervention . Police pushed the crowd back into France Square , where the noise level wa much louder than at demonstration last year.Tribute to the Dayan family ■ THE FINAL resting place of member of the famed Dayan family , whose contribution to the nation have been military , political , literary , and dramatic , includes Assi Dayan , the celebrated actor and filmmaker , who died on May 1 , 2014 , and his cousin Yehonatan Geffen , the author , poet , songwriter , journalist , satirist , and playwright who died on April 19 , 2023.Because Nahalal wa home to so many well-known personality , the cemetery , like the Trumpeldor Cemetery in Tel Aviv , is embedded in the nature of a tourist site , where the name on the tombstone are linked to the evolving history of the state.Writing in Maariv , the sister publication of The Jerusalem Post , journalist Lior Dayan , in paying tribute to his father Assi , who unfortunately wa a drug addict , observes that so often , when a parent dy , his or her child say they regret that there are so many thing they never got around to telling them . But that wa not the case with him and his father , Lior wrote . They told each other everything , candidly and without secret . At the start of the lengthy article , he mention how the tour guide & rsquo ; s anecdote about the Dayan family captivate the tourist group that visit the cemetery . On a recent visit to his father & rsquo ; s grave , he overheard a boy , standing with his mother , asking in relation to Assi , & ldquo ; So , what did he do ? & rdquo ; & ldquo ; He did a lot , & rdquo ; she replied . & ldquo ; A lot of good or a lot of bad ? & rdquo ; he persisted . & ldquo ; A lot of good for the public ; a lot of bad for himself , & rdquo ; she answered.In Lior & rsquo ; s opinion , this wa the most succinct and definitive summing up of who his father was.Aliza Bloch 's new book ■ POLITICAL LEADERS who lose to their opponent quickly learn that there is life beyond the corridor of power . Aliza Bloch , the immediate past mayor of Beit Shemesh , despite an intensely busy schedule during her period in office , nonetheless found time to prepare her new book , Bridges of Light , which she launched this month in the presence of Minister without Portfolio Chili Troper and several past and present politician , including member of the Beit Shemesh Municipal Council , a well a other well-known figures.ANZAC Day in Israel ■ ANZAC DAY , which commemorates the ill-fated dawn landing in Gallipoli by Australian and New Zealand troop on April 25 , 1915 , ha for many year been a day of remembrance for all the Australian and New Zealand soldier who died in the line of duty . In Israel , the ANZAC Day service is traditionally held at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Jerusalem at a reasonable hour of the morning , though one of the recent Australian ambassador insisted on a dawn service . It is usually hosted by the Australian ambassador and attended by military attach & eacute ; s & ndash ; and , occasionally , by ambassador of the Allied Forces that fought in the First World War & ndash ; a well a by representative of the Turkish and German embassy . This year , due to the current security situation and the Passover holiday , the service wa shorter than in past year , and instead of being held in Jerusalem , it took place at the Ramleh War Cemetery on Thursday of last week at the reasonable hour of 9.30 a.m . Kudos to Australian Ambassador Ralph King for refraining from a dawn service.greerfc @ gmail.com","grapevine april 28 , 2024 : israel prize dispute"

The planned eviction of the triggered widespread protest in the neighborhood and other part of Jerusalem over the past few month . & nbsp ; Last week , The Jerusalem Post revealed that Prime Minister Naftali Bennet doe not plan to evict the family even of the High Court make it possible . Sources close to Bennet said that they did not expect the court to order the government to enforce any eviction order or to impose a deadline . & nbsp ; A statement issued by several Palestinian armed group on Sunday called on the Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem to & ldquo ; ignite the flame of resistance under the foot of the Zionist occupier . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The occupation & rsquo ; s aggression against our people in Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah is increasing , & rdquo ; the statement read . & ldquo ; In addition , the aggression against the family threatened with displacement continues . The crime of the occupation have not stopped . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Voicing & ldquo ; full solidarity & rdquo ; with the Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank , the terror group said that they will defend them a they did during the & ldquo ; Sword of Jerusalem & rdquo ; battle , the name Hamas us to describe it 11-day war with Israel last May . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The resistance group that defended the people of Jerusalem and the West Bank will not fail them , & rdquo ; the group added . & ldquo ; We call on our people in the West Bank and Jerusalem to continue to ignite the flame of resistance at all point of contact with the Zionist occupier , and to ignite the occupied land under the foot of the Zionist usurper . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Mohammed Hamadeh , a spokesperson for Hamas , warned Israel against & ldquo ; playing with fire & rdquo ; regarding the possible eviction of the Sheikh Jarrah family . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The Palestinian people , who refuse to give up and surrender , will continue to resist all attempt by the occupier [ to evict the family ] , & rdquo ; Hamadeh said . & ldquo ; We are ready to respond to the aggression of the occupation . What the resistance group did not allow in the past , they will not allow today or tomorrow . The occupation must learn the lesson and stop tampering with the Jerusalem neighborhood . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Hamas official accused Israel of planning to & ldquo ; Judaize & rdquo ; Jerusalem and expel the Palestinians from the city . & nbsp ; Fatah activist in east Jerusalem also called for protest on Monday in solidarity with the Sheikh Jarrah family . & nbsp ; On the eve of the court ruling , Palestinian Authority Minister of Jerusalem Affairs , Fadi al-Hidmi , warned that any decision to evict the Palestinian family & ldquo ; would bring matter back to square one . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The case of the Sheikh Jarrah family ha reached & ldquo ; a critical and dangerous situation that requires urgent intervention by the international community , to prevent matter from returning to square one , & rdquo ; Hidmi cautioned . & nbsp ; He accused the Israeli government of presenting the case a a dispute over real estate and claimed that what is happening in Sheikh Jarrah is & ldquo ; a political issue par excellence . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Israeli government & rsquo ; s attempt to show that this is a legal dispute over real estate & ldquo ; will not deceive anyone , & rdquo ; Hidmi said . & ldquo ; The whole world know that the issue is political , and that what is happening is an attempt to replace the original owner of the land with settler . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The PA official said that the Palestinians do not trust the Israeli court which , he claimed , & ldquo ; serve a an executive tool & rdquo ; that work for the benefit of the Israeli government and settler . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The international community , especially the US , the European Union and the United Nations , must be firm in rejecting the displacement plan , & rdquo ; Hidmi continued . & ldquo ; We do not rely on the Israeli court , and we believe that only firm and decisive international intervention can force the Israeli government to reverse it decision .

This is against the backdrop of the northern border tension , the continued IDF operation in Rafah , and tension in the government on the haredi draft and rabbi bills.The opposition bloc rose to 62 mandate , without two Arab-led party , which would allow it , should it stay united , to formulate a coalition without being dependent on the Islamic Ra & rsquo ; am Party.The poll , led by Dr .

2024-03-06 03:54:30.543,jpost,"After more than 30 year in office a mayor of Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim , Benny Kashriel wa psyching himself up to move to Rome a Israel & rsquo ; s next ambassador to Italy.In recent year , Kashriel had been offered several opportunity to get out of local politics and into the Knesset . But he wasn & rsquo ; t interested . Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim wa the love of his life , and he wa happy to stay there and devote all his energy to it development.But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former foreign minister Eli Cohen had other plan for him , and persuaded him to enter the diplomatic corp . As a loyal Likudnik , Kashriel could refuse for only so long.But there & rsquo ; s one major obstacle by way of geography . Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim is located in the West Bank . That hasn & rsquo ; t deterred some leftist from living there , but it is a red rag to Italy , which decline to accept a West Bank & ldquo ; settler & rdquo ; a an ambassador in Rome.Even though he wa not due to take up the appointment till well into the summer , at this stage of the game Kashriel can not go back to being mayor , even though there are plenty of resident of Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim who would like to see him in that position.Hungary wa mentioned a a possible alternative , but the next ambassador to Hungary ha been approved both by Jerusalem and Budapest.The ideal situation would be for Israel to establish diplomatic relation with another country , and to accord Kashriel the honor of being Israel & rsquo ; s first ambassador there . But given Israel & rsquo ; s loss of popularity over event in Gaza , it & rsquo ; s unlikely for a new diplomatic relationship to materialize in the foreseeable future.Quickly forgotten & nbsp ; ■ ONE OF the sad thing about public figure is that once they resign or retire , they are quickly forgotten.A case in point is Moshe Mizrahi , who in the course of a long career served a director-general of both the office of the president and the prime minister , and met score of local and foreign dignitary while safeguarding the interest of five prime minister and two president . Mizrahi & rsquo ; s successor began to capture the interest of the medium , and Mizrahi wa all but forgotten , except by veteran journalist and by leading figure of his generation.Like many people who have led exciting and meaningful life , and who have made significant contribution to the history of their respective nation , Mizrahi decided to write a memoir , which he launched at the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation , where speaker included retired Supreme Court justice Elyakim Rubinstein , MK Avigdor Liberman , who ha known Mizrahi for some 30 year , Matan Vilna & rsquo ; i , a former deputy chief of staff of the IDF , politician , and diplomat , and Efrat Duvdevani , the director-general of the Peres Center.All four spoke of Mizrahi & rsquo ; s strong sense of patriotism , his dedication , and his important contribution to the nation and it security.Mizrahi also took a copy of his book to the President & rsquo ; s Residence and personally presented to President Isaac Herzog , who , a the son and nephew of several of the nation & rsquo ; s dignitary , wa familiar with episode and people mentioned in the book , and enjoyed reading about them a he skimmed through it.Abducted Holocaust historian named honoree of the 2024 Jan Karski Eagle Award & nbsp ; ■ The Jan Karski Society ha named abducted Holocaust historian Alex Dancyg a the honoree of the Jan Karski Eagle Award for 2024.In May 2000 , only two month before his death , Karski established the award to be presented to people who have distinguished themselves by defending human right , speaking out against aggression and on behalf of the integrity of ethnic and religious group and sovereign nations.A Polish soldier , member of the Resistance during the Second World War , diplomat , academic , and author , Karski wa captured by the Gestapo and tortured . He wa smuggled out of prison , and , in an attempt to stop the Holocaust , traveled to Britain and the United States , to tell Allied leader of what the Nazis had done to Poland and how they were exterminating the Jews of Europe.He migrated to the US after the war , but his heart remained in Poland , where he wa always held in high esteem , a he wa in Israel , where he wa named Righteous Among the Nations and wa awarded honorary citizenship.Warsaw-born Dancyg , who wa associated with Yad Vashem , and who led many group to Poland and facilitated dialogue between Polish and Israeli youth , wa abducted by Hamas from his home at Kibbutz Nir Oz and taken to Gaza . Both Poland and Israel mounted campaign for his return.Dancyg wa mentioned by President Andrzej Duda at the traditional Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw.Speaking in the presence of Poland & rsquo ; s Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich and Israeli Ambassador Yacov Livne , Duda noted that the Hanukkah candle-lighting tradition had been inaugurated by president Lech Kaczynski on December 18 , 2006 , and had taken place annually ever since.Duda said he is glad that after the Holocaust and other tragedy , citizen of Poland had over the past 30 year experienced the restoration of Jewish tradition and Jewish culture.Dancyg is not the first member of the Jewish faith to be considered deserving of the Jan Karski award . Others have included anti-Communist dissident Adam Michnik , former director of the Anti-Defamation League Abe Foxman , former president and prime minister Shimon Peres , and author , philosopher and Holocaust survivor Eli Wiesel.Canceling the Israel Prize category ■ IT & rsquo ; S AMAZING the extent to which Education Minister Yoav Kisch manages to get himself into hot water . Up until now he ha managed to extricate himself , but it will take a lot more effort this time , with his decision to cancel the Israel Prize award in a year in which Israel most definitely need a morale booster.But worse than the cancellation itself is the reason for it & ndash ; the fact that the Science Prize wa to be awarded to Eyal Waldman , one of the most outspoken critic of Netanyahu and the planned judicial reform.Initially , Kisch wanted to simply cancel the category . But then he declared that because Israel is at war , it would be inappropriate to hold the Israel Prize award ceremony this year.Why ? So many other event that are traditionally held on Independence Day will be held a usual . Look how many event are being held around the country for International Women & rsquo ; s Day.Aside from that , if Kisch wanted to cancel or postpone the Israel Prize award ceremony , why did he not do so month ago ? Why wait till the adjudicating committee & rsquo ; s choice of Waldman wa made public ? Why humiliate a bereaved father whose daughter Danielle and her boyfriend were murdered by Hamas ? Previous Israel Prize scandal ■ SOMETHING AS honorable a the Israel Prize should not be marred by scandal . Unfortunately , the current episode is not the first or even the second.In 1992 , Emile Habibi , an Arab politician who wa also a gifted writer , wa awarded the Israel Prize for Arabic literature.Arab nationalist pressured him not to accept it , but Habibi , who two year earlier had been awarded the Al Quds Prize for literature , argued that his being awarded the Israel Prize signified official recognition of a national culture , adding that a dialogue over prize wa preferable to arguing over stone and bullets.There were many Jews who also objected to Habibi receiving the Israel Prize , so much so that right-wing die-hard Yuval Neeman , who had received the Israel Prize for physic in 1969 , returned it in 1992 to emphasize his displeasure.There wa also a scandal the following year , in 1993 , when Yeshayahu Leibowitz , a controversial , outspoken Orthodox philosopher and scientist , wa selected to receive the Israel Prize . Leibowitz had urged Israeli soldier to refuse order that would in any way be harmful to peaceful Palestinians . Yitzhak Rabin , who wa then prime minister , declared that he would not attend the ceremony if Leibowitz wa to receive the prize.Unwilling to fan the flame of controversy on the most important national day of the year , Leibowitz declined to accept the prize.The year 2021 wa an uncomfortable one for Yoav Gallant , who wa then education minister , with two Israel Prize scandal on his hands.One of the people selected for the prize wa Yehuda Meshi-Zahav , a haredi and former anti-Zionist activist who founded ZAKA and changed his attitude to the extent of sending his son to the army.But after it wa announced that Gallant had informed him of his selection for the Israel Prize , story began to surface about year of sexual abuse that Meshi-Zahav had inflicted on both religious and secular women.As police began their investigation , Meshi-Zahav decided to forgo the prize and also resigned from ZAKA . He subsequently tried to commit suicide , but wa rescued by one of his son . However , he remained in a coma for more than a year before he died.In 2021 , Prof . Oded Goldreich of the Weizmann Institute of Science wa also selected to be awarded the Israel Prize . His category wa mathematics . But Gallant refused to accept the recommendation of the jury , alleging that Goldreich supported the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement.Goldreich denied the allegation , stating that all he had done wa to add his signature to those on a petition calling on the EU to halt it funding to Ariel University , which is located in the West Bank.The jury petitioned the High Court of Justice on Goldreich & rsquo ; s behalf , and fellow Prof . David Harel , who wa among the Israel Prize winner in 2004 , offered to share his prize with Goldreich.Yifat Shasha-Biton , who had succeeded Gallant a education minister , agreed with his decision on Goldreich . But a month later , Avichai Mandelblit , who wa then the attorney-general , told the High Court that in his opinion the prize should be awarded to Goldreich.In March 2022 , the court ruled that the prize should be awarded to Goldreich , who eventually received the prize in a private ceremony at the Education Ministry , and announced that he would donate the prize money of NIS 75,000 to five human right organization , including Breaking the Silence.Netanyahu would earn brownie point if he made a public statement to the effect that the Israel Prize is awarded on merit in a certain field , and that it should in no way be influenced by political considerations.He should add that even though he and Waldman are at complete odds politically , he recognizes Waldman & rsquo ; s contribution to technology , and will be pleased to congratulate him on that issue at the Israel Prize ceremony.Israeli professor awarded world & rsquo ; s most prestigious prize for brain research ■ AS PRIZES go , the medium are , of course , focused on the Israel Prize , and in paying so much attention , some medium outlet may overlook the fact that an Israeli ha been awarded the world & rsquo ; s most prestigious prize for brain research.Prof . Haim Sompolinsky , a physicist and neuroscience researcher at the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Neuroscience at the Hebrew University and professor at the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University , is the first Israeli scientist to receive The Brain Prize , which is awarded by the Lundbeck Foundation to pioneer in the field of neuroscience . He share the & euro ; 1.3 million prize with Prof . Larry Abbott of Columbia University and Prof . Terrence Sejnowski of the Salk Institute.Sompolinsky is widely acclaimed for his groundbreaking work in theoretical and computational neuroscience , particularly in the study of neural circuit dynamic in the brain . His research ha significantly contributed to the understanding of how neural circuit process and encode information , map the external world , and participate in learning and memory . Through a combination of theoretical and computational approach , his work ha elucidated key computational principle underlying brain function.The Brain Prize , initiated in 2011 and awarded annually by the Lundbeck Foundation , is considered the most prestigious award in neuroscience . It recognizes researcher whose work ha advanced the field , from fundamental research to clinical application . Sompolinsky & rsquo ; s research not only deepens the knowledge of the brain & rsquo ; s inner working but also hold promise for application in brain-inspired artificial intelligence.In congratulating Sompolinsky , Hebrew University President Prof . Asher Cohen stated : & ldquo ; Prof . Sompolinsky & rsquo ; s Brain Prize triumph is a testament to his pioneering contribution in computational neuroscience , unraveling neural circuit dynamic and laying the foundation for insight into information processing . His groundbreaking work inspires artificial intelligence , blending experimentation and theory to illuminate fundamental computational principle in brain function . & ldquo ; This recognition not only honor his exceptional achievement but serf a a beacon guiding u toward further revelation at the intersection of neuroscience and computation . & rdquo ; Sompolinsky and his two colleague will receive the 2024 Brain Prize at a ceremony in Copenhagen in June.Brain Prize recipient were previously presented with their award by the crown prince of Denmark , who is now king . It is not yet known whether he will continue to do so in his role a monarch.Sompolinsky is the son of the late Prof . David Sompolinsky , who wa born in Denmark , and whose personal history wa one that pointed not only to academic success but also to heroism . Together with friend from the Danish underground , he saved hundred of Danish Jews from Nazi persecution in October 1943 by smuggling them on fishing boat to a safe haven in Sweden.Shai Piron call on haredi to enlist ■ FORMER EDUCATION minister Shai Piron , who is religious and studied in several yeshivot before , during , and after his service in the IDF , ha lost friend , colleague , and student in the war against Hamas . He ha called on haredi to enlist & ldquo ; because we need you . & rdquo ; Haredim have been extremely active in numerous civilian operation on behalf of soldier and evacuee . If they could take time out from Torah study , simply to do good , why not to defend ? Then again , some haredi men who have enlisted , because they understood the meaning of mutual responsibility , have been disappointed by not being called to fight after a year & rsquo ; s intensive training . One of them , in conversation on KAN Reshet Bet with Liat Regev , told her that he had not been called up , and did not know why , and he knew of other haredi young men who had voluntarily enlisted , spent a year in training , and were still sitting at home , waiting for a call-up.What is the point of this if the defense establishment doesn & rsquo ; t want to have haredi on the battlefield ? If it doe want them , why not call them up when they & rsquo ; re willing to fight and put their life on the line ? Haredim who sign up display special courage , because there is so much pressure on them from their family and their community not to do so . ■ ON ANOTHER , more personal issue , Piron is a pleased a punch . His daughter Or Piron Zomer campaigned to head the Oranit Council & ndash ; and triumphed .

Estonian Ambassador Veikko Kala may have started a trend among some of his colleague . The idea wa that all the guest would congregate at the Cooking Studio in Tel Aviv , and under the supervision of professional chef would prepare kosher meal for evacuee , thereby adding to Israel & rsquo ; s national resilience.Many of the invitee loved the idea , and some 120 showed up & ndash ; approximately half of them diplomat and half Israelis , a well a friend who were neither diplomat nor Israelis . Altogether , there were more than the embassy expected.Each participant received the gift of an Estonian apron with the embassy logo and the slogan & ldquo ; Estonia cook with you . & rdquo ; During approximately one and a half hour , they prepared salmon , beef stew , roast chicken , beef patty , and tofu , served with rice , potato , and green bean . Anyone hoping for a taste of Estonian cuisine wa disappointed , but it wa such a fun evening that no one minded the Israeli fare that wa served afterward with wine.Guests who had minimal kitchen experience quickly learned to chop , slice , cook , and pack.Generally , when one talk of stirring the pot , it mean causing tension , but in this case Gil Haskel , chief of State Protocol , wa literally stirring the pot a he shared a work counter with Croatian Ambassador Vesela Korac and the deputy head of mission of Portugal and Italy.Some 300 meal were prepared , and because the date coincided with the second anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine , recipient included Israeli evacuee and Ukrainian refugee who are being sheltered in Israel for the duration of the war in their homeland.An extra bonus for the guest wa that many were working side by side with people they had not previously known , and were thus able to make new friend with ease.After all their work , they were rewarded with a mouthwatering supper washed down with excellent wine.greerfc @ gmail.com","grapevine , march 6 , 2024 : arrivederci rom"
2021-08-07 05:11:07.347,jpost,"Two separate incident that took place in the West Bank over the past few day underlined the discrepancy between the Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s rhetoric in public and it action on the ground . & ldquo ; The Palestinian Authority is a real Jekyll and Hyde , & rdquo ; a Ramallah-based Western diplomat remarked this week with reference to the inconsistency . & ldquo ; The Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s rhetoric towards Israel is bad , but it action on the ground , especially the security coordination with the Israeli security authority , are good . & rdquo ; The diplomat & rsquo ; s remark is shared by many Palestinians who are familiar with the inner working of the PA . In the first incident , two Israeli woman in their 40 were spotted by Palestinians late at night driving their car alone inside al-Ama & rsquo ; ri refugee camp at the entrance to Ramallah and it twin city , El-Bireh . The camp is considered a stronghold of Palestinian militant belonging to various group , including those opposed to PA President Mahmoud Abbas and his ruling Fatah faction . The PA security force are often reluctant to enter al-Ama & rsquo ; ri to avoid friction with the group . In this case , however , a soon a the PA security force were informed about the presence of the Israeli woman in the camp , they rushed to the scene and safely escorted them out and handed them over to the IDF . The second incident took place in the PA-controlled part of Hebron , a city traditionally known a a stronghold of Islamist group , particularly Hamas and Hizb ut-Tahrir ( Party of Liberation ) . A bus carrying IDF soldier that accidentally entered Hebron wa safely escorted by PA security force out of the city . No one wa hurt and minimal damage wa caused to the bus a a result of rock-throwing by a small number of Palestinians . The two incident could have ended in a tragic way , were it not for the intervention of the PA security force . Had any of the woman or soldier been harmed , this would have resulted in a serious deterioration in the security situation on the ground and renewed tension between the new Israeli government headed by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and the PA . Such an escalation would also have dealt a severe blow to the Biden administration & rsquo ; s effort to rebuild confidence between Israel and the Palestinians with the hope of reviving the stalled peace process . The Biden administration ha endorsed a policy that seek to bolster the standing of the PA a a way of countering the rising popularity of Hamas . The Americans want the Israeli government to follow suit by engaging with PA official and refraining from unilateral move , including the eviction of Arab family from their home in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah . Indeed , Bennett & rsquo ; s government and the PA leadership appear to be moving toward some form of rapprochement . In addition to the continuing security coordination , Israeli and PA minister recently met for the first time in several year . Moreover , the government ha agreed to increase the number of permit for Palestinians who wish to work in Israel , and , according to Palestinian source , senior PA official whose VIP card were confiscated by the previous government of Benjamin Netanyahu have gotten them back . Some Palestinians maintain that the security coordination between the PA security force and the IDF never stopped , not even when Abbas and other Palestinian institution claimed that they had suspended all tie with Israel , including in the security field . The incident in Ramallah and Hebron were not the first of their kind . Several case involving Israeli ( Jewish ) citizen who were seen by the Palestinians inside Area A of the West Bank have been returned safely to Israel , thanks to the effort of the PA security force . Entry into this area , which is controlled exclusively by the PA , is forbidden to all Israeli citizen . Israel , however , doe not stop Arab-Israelis from entering Area A . Most of the case involving Israelis caught in Area A are not publicized , probably in order to avoid embarrassing the PA . Each time Palestinians learn that the PA security force & ldquo ; rescued & rdquo ; Israeli citizen caught in Area A , they accuse the Palestinian leadership of & ldquo ; collaboration & rdquo ; and serving a & ldquo ; subcontractor & rdquo ; for the Israeli security establishment . But the security coordination is not a one-way relationship benefiting Israel alone . Abbas wa quoted a few year ago a telling a group of Israelis who visited him at the Mukata presidential compound in Ramallah that security coordination [ with Israel ] is & ldquo ; sacred . & rdquo ; Although Abbas did not elaborate , it & rsquo ; s obvious that the Palestinians , too , enjoy the fruit of this coordination . First , the PA and Israel have a common enemy in the West Bank & ndash ; Hamas . Abbas is well aware that without Israel & rsquo ; s security presence in the West Bank , Hamas and another Iranian-backed proxy , Palestinian Islamic Jihad , would pose a direct threat to the PA . Second , the security coordination ensures the continued flow of fund to the PA from the Americans , Europeans and other international party . In a bid to further curry favor with the Western donor , including the Biden administration , Abbas and senior PA official have recently indicated their readiness to return to the negotiating table with Israel under the auspex of the Quartet member & ndash ; US , European Union , United Nations , and Russia . PA official who are talking about their dissatisfaction with the Bennett government are actually sending a message to the Biden administration that it need to get more involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . YET WHILE Palestinian security officer are & ldquo ; rescuing & rdquo ; Israelis who accidentally enter Area A , and a the security coordination appears to be continuing in full force and effect , the rhetoric of the PA and Fatah toward Israel remains a toxic a ever . This is precisely why many Palestinians and Israelis are confused about the real intention of the PA leadership . On the one hand , the PA is telling Palestinians that it want to prosecute Israelis for & ldquo ; war crime & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; ethnic cleansing & rdquo ; before international forum , including the International Criminal Court . The PA is also telling Palestinians that there is no difference between the Bennett government and the Netanyahu government , especially regarding the policy of settlement construction and the & ldquo ; Judaization & rdquo ; of Jerusalem . On the other hand , this is the same PA that is allowing it minister and security official to hold meeting with their Israeli counterpart . Similarly , many in Israel still can not figure out whether the PA is an ally or an enemy . The PA & rsquo ; s deed and rhetoric suggest that it is both an ally and an enemy . It is an ally when it come to working with the IDF in maintaining security and stability in the West Bank . It is an enemy when it come to the fiery rhetoric of PA official and medium outlet . & ldquo ; The Palestinian Authority ha always excelled in sending conflicting message to both the Palestinians and the Israelis , & rdquo ; remarked a veteran Palestinian journalist from Ramallah . & ldquo ; The Palestinians have long become used to the duplicity of the Palestinian leadership . & rdquo ; The PA & rsquo ; s action on the ground may be good for Israel in the short term . These action place the PA on the side of the good guy in the war on terrorism . In the long run , however , the anti-Israel rhetoric emerging from Ramallah is further radicalizing Palestinians . The PA , in other word , is driving more Palestinians into the welcoming arm of it own rival , Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad . The apparent rapprochement between the PA and the Israeli government and the Biden administration & rsquo ; s policy of & ldquo ; strengthening & rdquo ; the PA are critical for the continued survival of Abbas and his cohort . But this approach come with a cost . The closer Abbas move toward Israel and the US , the more he loses point with the Palestinian street . The Bennett government and the Biden administration may help the 85-year-old Abbas hold on to power , but there & rsquo ; s nothing the Israelis and Americans can do to help him regain the confidence of his people . Abbas & rsquo ; s decision to cancel the parliamentary election , which wa supposed to take place on May 22 , and the recent unprecedented massive security crackdown on Palestinian political activist , journalist and social medium user have severely undermined the credibility of the PA leadership . At this stage , it & rsquo ; s clear that the widespread discontent with the Ramallah-based leadership doe not pose an imminent threat to the PA . The PA security force remain loyal to Abbas , and the number of people willing to take to the street to demand & ldquo ; regime change & rdquo ; is declining every week . If and when the peace talk with Israel resume , Abbas is sure to face a radical reaction from the Palestinians . Under the current circumstance , the likelihood of marketing any agreement with Israel to the Palestinian public is zero . This statistical nonstarter is the direct result of the PA & rsquo ; s decades-long demonization of Israel , which remains one of the major obstacle to moving forward with any peace process .",why is pa rhetoric so anti-israel when there is good cooperation ?
2023-11-03 11:40:16.200,jpost,"Just over a year ago , Stav Levi met Idan Shtivi , 28 , while she wa working for a brief period at Ijo & amp ; Babet , a wine bar on Tel Aviv & rsquo ; s Dizengoff Street . The chance meeting , a growing rarity in the age of online dating , sparked a deep love that ha grown over a relatively short time . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; One of the thing that defines Idan is his heart . There aren & rsquo ; t so many people who you can say are truly pure in their core . He is quiet , but so profound and strong , & rdquo ; Levi say , smiling wanly , if only for an instant , a she enters the fourth week without him a her rock and partner . Idan is still missing , presumed to be held captive in the Gaza Strip a the deadly war that ha consumed Levi & rsquo ; s life wage on.Together , they camped and hiked throughout Israel , sharing a mutual love for nature and the environment & ndash ; a defining passion that led Idan to pursue a career in environmental science at Reichman University & rsquo ; s School of Sustainability , where he began his second year recently . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Idan is driven to make an impact in the world , with a desire to promote green energy and environmental conservation . He ha this connection to the earth , & rdquo ; explains his older brother , Omri , 30 , gazing across the crystal blue water of the Mediterranean Sea from his mother & rsquo ; s apartment in Tel Aviv . & nbsp ; Idan life for the water , and wa about to sign a new lease with Levi on October 9 in the seaside community of Ein Hayam . The natural and free-flowing nature of the water mirror Idan & rsquo ; s outlook on life , sharing a passion for free-diving and extreme sport with his brother . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; He and his friend were together on a boat in the middle of the sea , and Idan dove into the water , & rdquo ; Omri recount . & ldquo ; A minute passed , then two minute , and his friend started to worry . After three minute , Idan resurfaced , catching a huge fish and [ sporting ] a big smile . He is the kind of person who will always surprise you . He & rsquo ; s a survivor , and this is what help u to believe . & rdquo ; Maintaining his composure , Omri hold on to the belief that his brother & rsquo ; s survival instinct will soon return him to his family . & nbsp ; To his family and many friend , Idan is the anchor that imparts a sense of confidence , a reassuring presence to everyone around him that everything will always be okay . Idan & rsquo ; s family hold on to that feeling , trusting that Idan will persevere against all odds and return to them . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Growing up , Idan always made me feel secure , and I could always depend on him for everything . Whenever I am struggling , he is always there beside me , & rdquo ; say his sister , Hila , 24 , detailing to the extent that Idan would stay with her at night when she wa scared or had trouble sleeping , until she would fall asleep . & ldquo ; He & rsquo ; s this person who make you feel that you can do anything . Anything that need to be done , fixed , taken care of , that & rsquo ; s Idan . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Idan wa asked to photograph at Supernova music festivalAN AMATEUR photographer , Idan wa asked at the last minute by friend to take picture during the yoga and music workshop they were leading the next morning at the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re & rsquo ; im in the western Negev . Idan made sure to join his family for Shabbat dinner on October 6 before waking up at 5 a.m . to drive down to help capture the beauty of the peaceful gathering in the warm glow of the desert sun . This wa the last time his family saw him before the celebration of music and nature would become the epicenter of the most tragic event of their life . & ldquo ; Idan had only just arrived [ at the festival ] when I called him at 6:48 a.m . and he told me that rocket had started to go off . It wa just the rocket at this point . It wa only a matter of minute before gunshot were fired , & rdquo ; Levi recall a she sits at Idan & rsquo ; s mother & rsquo ; s kitchen table with Omri and Hila , recounting the haunting event that they continue to replay in their head . & nbsp ; Idan & rsquo ; s survival instinct quickly kicked in , calmly explaining to his girlfriend that they were packing up and getting ready to head home with the two friend he had traveled with . Just a they were about to leave , Idan saw another friend who wa wounded and took responsibility to drive his car , along with another girl , making sure to help everyone escape safely . & ldquo ; They were one of the first car to get out before anyone understood the extent of the real situation , at around 7:15 , & rdquo ; Omri elaborates , detailing every aspect of his brother & rsquo ; s attempted escape . & ldquo ; They had made it onto the main road before seeing it had been blocked by Hamas terrorist in stolen police car . He crossed over into the southbound lane , and only made it approximately 4 km . before it appeared that Hamas opened fire somewhere near the junction at Kissufim . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Without any photographic evidence , witness account , or Israeli intelligence to confirm if Idan is alive , Omri , Hila , and Levi face an ongoing nightmare that grows with each passing day . Desperate for answer , and plagued by uncertainty , Omri had to piece together the event that unfolded himself , tracking his brother & rsquo ; s location from his phone , looking through photograph of the carnage that took place , and eventually traveling himself to Idan & rsquo ; s last known location after a week without any information on his brother & rsquo ; s whereabouts . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It wa absolute hell , and just to see it wa traumatic , & rdquo ; he recall . & ldquo ; Burnt car filled with bullet hole , the festival site wa destroyed & hellip ; I wa there for hour [ searching ] , but I quickly understood that the area wa enormous ; it would take thousand of people to search . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The car that Idan had driven wa bloodstained and filled with bullet hole , near a tree off the side of the road , leading Omri to understand that the terrorist continued to shoot at Idan and the two friend he had helped escape , before being forced to veer off the road . The body of the other two passenger with Idan were found , but there is still no evidence to conclude that Idan wa among those slain in the massacre . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; As our option [ for Idan & rsquo ; s fate ] continue to narrow , we assume , or maybe just hope , that he wa abducted , but there is no official news , & rdquo ; Hila surmise , clinging to the belief that her brother is among the 240 hostage who are being held in Gaza.Faced with the unimaginable trial of making it through each day , Omri , Hila and Levi continue to investigate , communicate with Israeli intelligence agency , and reach out to other witness , hoping to glean a shred of evidence to confirm that Idan is still alive . Holding steadfast to their belief in Idan & rsquo ; s survival instinct , his family continues to persevere against the bleak alternative.For Idan & rsquo ; s family , this heinous act of terror transcends classification a a war crime & ndash ; it is a crime against the morality of mankind . Quickly taking a more assertive tone , Levi clarifies the sentiment of the hundred of family who have been torn apart by Hamas . & ldquo ; The global community need to [ step in ] . We don & rsquo ; t know who ha been taken hostage , & rdquo ; she say . & ldquo ; There are more than 100 family like u who don & rsquo ; t even know , don & rsquo ; t have any answer . We can & rsquo ; t tolerate this for even another minute . & ldquo ; The first thing that need to happen is to bring in the Red Cross , & rdquo ; she stress . & ldquo ; What is the status of the hostage & ndash ; who they are , who is alive and who is dead & ndash ; and , most importantly , to bring them home ! & rdquo ; ","israeli hostage in gaza : idan shtivi , a reassuring presence to everyone around him"

The mother & ldquo ; wa evacuated and had just received a diagnosis that her child is autistic . Before she came to u , she didn & rsquo ; t know what to do , & rdquo ; Strul said , explaining that the mother wa forced to leave her home right after receiving her child & rsquo ; s diagnosis and had no idea what framework wa appropriate for , or accessible to , her child during the war.To make matter more complicated , this mother & rsquo ; s husband wa called to reserve duty and wa unreachable in Gaza . She then she found out she wa pregnant with her second child . & ldquo ; You have to understand that the evacuee have a very difficult experience because they have been uprooted from their home , & rdquo ; said Strul , explaining that thing are especially hard when you & ldquo ; uproot a child with a disability from their home . & rdquo ; Strul shared that she marveled at the difficulty of the situation , asking herself how she could help someone handling so much chaos . & ldquo ; She [ the mother ] really fell apart , & rdquo ; described Strul.Along with her team , Strul helped the mother to find an appropriate framework , and providing this help gave Strul the chance to take action , which , in turn , helped her handle her own experience . It & ldquo ; made me sharper and kept me from sinking in the sadness and terrible grief we are all dealing with , & rdquo ; she explained.Personally helping this woman & ldquo ; took me to a place of & lsquo ; okay , I have a job to do , and I need to lead the team and help the family , and have some routine , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; she said , adding that this story made her stronger.ANOTHER ELEMENT that made thing emotionally difficult for many employee and intervention center family wa the mixed Arab-Jewish nature of many of Elwyn & rsquo ; s team , said Strul.This proximity at work & ldquo ; brought up the conflict that exists in the country , & rdquo ; she said . It wa hard to avoid sensitive topic , at a time when tension and emotion were so high.There were & ldquo ; parent whose child were in preschool with Arab staff , & rdquo ; which brought up fear for some of them , described Strul , adding that & ldquo ; this also impacted Arab employee who encountered Jewish parent who were uncomfortable with them . & rdquo ; Strul handled these feeling with open communication . & ldquo ; You have to give these feeling space , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; If you pretend these feeling don & rsquo ; t exist , they will come out in the end . So , first of all , we decided that we were going to give them space and talk about them on a local level . & ldquo ; If we saw that there were problem or conflict , feeling that sometimes aren & rsquo ; t apparent on the surface but are under the surface , we addressed them , & rdquo ; she said.IN ADDITION to the emotional turmoil of helping the family from their center , Elwyn & rsquo ; s staff had to contend with numerous logistical hurdles.Some of the center did not have appropriate shelter and needed to be totally relocated to space with adequate protection . Some center were too close to conflict zone , and needed to be totally evacuated.The organization offered a variety of solution , depending on the stage of the war and the unique need it presented . & ldquo ; We offered service from afar , using video . An occupational therapist would show parent how to help with their child & rsquo ; s treatment at home , & rdquo ; said Strul , who added that the organization recruited numerous volunteer to help provide these services.The organization also prepped the center & rsquo ; s shelter and drilled taking the child into the shelter in the appropriate time frame . Elwyn staff created special activity for the child to do while they were in shelter , to try to make the time pas more calmly.Caring for these family in the chaos of the war wa an incredible challenge , but no less of a challenge wa the job of caring for the early intervention center staff , Strul explained . & ldquo ; The son of one of our worker wa murdered at the [ Super ] nova music festival , & rdquo ; Strul recounted . & ldquo ; It wa a shock , encountering that on a personal level , when one of your worker loses her 21-year-old son . She wa totally broken , & rdquo ; said Strul , who added that handling this loss of someone who is a daily part of her life caused her to break down a well . & ldquo ; We accompanied her for the whole shiva [ mourning period ] and we were with her and came to visit her , & rdquo ; Strul said , adding that they also provided space for the staff to process the loss together.Many of Strul & rsquo ; s staff were also evacuated from their home in the North . & ldquo ; There wa a lot of thought put into what happens with those worker , how can we help them so they will come back to a sort of schedule , & rdquo ; Strul explained . & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think there wa a single worker who did not get the care they needed , & rdquo ; she said.Looking forward , Strul feel prepared to handle whatever the continuation of the war , or possible escalation in the north , might throw their way.There is a feeling that the war is present . & ldquo ; There could be a siren today , & rdquo ; said Strul , & ldquo ; but it doesn & rsquo ; t occupy u daily . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; What is important is that , in an emergency , the staff know what to do with each child , where to take them , where the safe area is for each structure , who the Home Front Command contact is , what is in the shelter , what equipment , & rdquo ; she explained.Unexpected event will always be present , but Strul isn & rsquo ; t worried . When asked why , her answer is simple : & ldquo ; Because we are prepared for it . & rdquo ;",child disability organization face challenge during the war
2024-03-18 17:28:35.910,jpost,"The Zimin Institute ha been at the forefront of scientific philanthropy for over six year , supporting research at university worldwide , including Tel Aviv University ( TAU ) . Its mission is to harness contemporary scientific insight to address humanity & rsquo ; s challenge , bridging the gap between theory and practicscienal application . An integral part of this process is the & ldquo ; Scope of Research , & rdquo ; where once a year , a scientific committee and an international committee both work to identify study that have the potential to create real change in the world , and for collaboration with other research team from around the world . In addition , the institute & rsquo ; s biannual international conference brings together leading academic , professional , and investor from around the world to create scientific partnership and develop breakthrough discoveries.Headed by Prof . David Mendlovic , the Zimin Institute at TAU is among the pioneering & ldquo ; Zimin Institutes for a Better World , & rdquo ; established by the Zimin Foundation . Driven by the vision of the late Dr . Dimitri Zimin , an engineer , entrepreneur , and philanthropist , these institute aim to integrate engineering research with medical and healthcare technology , aligning seamlessly with TAU & rsquo ; s multidisciplinary ethos . The institute take pride in funding numerous groundbreaking study , many of which are already making tangible impact in the healthcare industry , thus realizing Dr . Zimin & rsquo ; s vision of fostering positive change.A recent success story involves Zimin & rsquo ; s investment in early detection technology for fetal malformation and developmental disorder . Building on groundbreaking research in fetal electrocardiogram ( FECGs ) at TAU , this investment ha yielded promising result . FECG , the prevailing method for detecting developmental difference and fetal distress , is currently limited by it reliance on invasive technique or noisy maternal signal . In a breakthrough study , researcher Dr . Dan Raviv and Dr . Shai Tejman-Yarden propose a novel approach to extract FECGs from joint maternal-fetal data using deep learning model . Their method , personalized and self-supervised for each patient , demonstrates real-time extraction of high-quality maternal and fetal ECGs , offering a significant advancement in fetal monitoring accuracy.In the study , researcher Dr . Dan Raviv from the School of Electrical Engineering at TAU and Dr . Shai Tejman-Yarden from Sheba Hospital propose a new approach to extracting the FECG from the joint maternal-fetal data , which come attached to the common ECG sample from at least two source . They then train a Deep Learning model to separate the two in real-time . Because this is a difficult task , the researcher created a personalized and self-supervised network for patient . This method train individually on the data of each patient ( mother and fetus ) and can extract the maternal and fetal ECG in real-time and with high quality . Based on preliminary result using real-world data , the researcher demonstrate that the hypothesis and solution are applicable and feasible.Another medical project funded by the Zimin Institute that is already in it advanced stage is the TENG ( Triboelectric nanogenerator ) sensor , which can restore the sense of touch to people who have lost this sense due to injury , illness , chemotherapy , and more . The sensor is durable , small , and modular and operates using an independent energy source to restore tactile sensitivity without the need for an external energy source , and can be easily and safely implanted under the skin in a variety of place . Today there are million of people in the world who have lost their sense of touch , and there is currently no approved clinical solution capable of restoring their sensation . Through the unique support that the Zimin Institute offered to the team of researcher , led by Prof . Ben Maoz from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at TAU , a start-up company called Teng-Able wa established , and their sensor is currently in the clinical trial phase . & nbsp ;",the zimin institute at tau : promoting scientific solution for humankind ’ s challenge

2024-06-08 00:32:23.407,jpost,"The French movie The Sixth Child , which opened in Israeli theater on Thursday , brings to mind the famous line from Jean Renoir & rsquo ; s The Rules of the Game : & ldquo ; The awful thing about life is this : everyone ha their reason . & rdquo ; The Sixth Child , directed by Leopold Legrand , is an intricately constructed tragedy about two couple who choose to make an awful but understandable decision , and they all have their reason . What & rsquo ; s brilliant about it is that , a heartrending a this story is , there are no obvious villain & ndash ; other than a heartless economy and an unfeeling adoption bureaucracy & ndash ; and no easy answers.As I watched the movie , my loyalty kept shifting among the character , and I wasn & rsquo ; t always sure where it wa going & ndash ; one of the highest compliment I can give any movie.What is The Sixth Child about ? The movie start out showing the tough life of Franck ( Damien Bonnard , who can currently be seen in Poor Things ) and Meriem ( Judith Chemla , who starred in the Israeli film The End of Love ) , a Roma couple struggling to make end meet a they raise five child in a trailer park , which they have chosen because it is near good schools.Franck is a scrap metal dealer , and when his partner pick a fight , he , too , get in trouble with the law . Julien ( Benjamin Lavernhe , who recently appeared in Jeanne du Barry and who wa also in The Sense of Wonder ) , the lawyer Meriem hire to get him out of the jam , is understanding and make a payment plan . To thank him , Franck insists that Julien and his wife , Anna ( Sara Giraudeau , one of the star of The Bureau ) , who is also a lawyer , stop by for a beer.Anna isn & rsquo ; t interested at first but then is charmed by their child , and it turn out that she can & rsquo ; t have any of her own . They have tried IVF several time and it failed , and psychologist have given her damning report when they have tried to adopt , essentially saying she want a baby too badly.A little while later , when Franck come to Julien & rsquo ; s office unannounced , Julien think it is because he need more help with his case . But it & rsquo ; s not that : Meriem is pregnant with what will be their sixth child . They are devout Catholics and an abortion is out of the question , but they are already packed like sardine into their trailer . Franck desperately need money for a new van to replace the one that wa damaged in an accident ; without it , he can & rsquo ; t support the family . So he proposes an unholy deal : their baby in exchange for money to buy a new van.Julien quickly shuts him down : This would be human trafficking and highly illegal . But when he tell Anna about the incident , she is desperate to go for it . They float the idea of a legal deal : an open adoption , where they would raise the child , but Franck and Meriem would still be the parent and would be in the child & rsquo ; s life . But Meriem can & rsquo ; t bear this idea . She would much prefer to give the baby to this couple and walk away.At this point , Julien is desperate to shut down the whole idea because he know that to pay the couple for their baby would be wrong , legally and morally . But Anna can & rsquo ; t let go of this dream of raising this baby , and Meriem and Franck have decided they will give the baby up for adoption in any case , since they are in such dire financial strait . Anna & rsquo ; s determination over this baby drive a wedge between her and her husband . Meanwhile , Meriem is despondent about the idea of giving up this baby but know she can not give another child a good life.THE STORY play out like a Greek tragedy , in which each character follows his own destiny , no matter how much sorrow it will bring . You wish for a happy ending for all of them , knowing it isn & rsquo ; t possible.At first I thought that the two lawyer would be portrayed a vile , predatory rich people , but the movie go in a different direction . They are portrayed a deserving of compassion because of their infertility , and if the film is anyone & rsquo ; s story , it & rsquo ; s Anna & rsquo ; s.While it & rsquo ; s clear that capitalism and anti-Roma racism have put Franck and Meriem into an impossible situation , they have a warm , loving family , which Anna and Julien don & rsquo ; t have . There is no explanation given for the fact that they can & rsquo ; t have child , but it is devastating for Anna and , to a lesser extent , for Julien.The four actor work well together , and all give good performance , but the standout is Giraudeau a Anna . It is she who drive the action and can & rsquo ; t give up , willing to sacrifice her upper-class life to become a mother.There have been many movie about parent who fight over child , such a several film based on the Baby M and similar case , and many fall into clich & eacute ; s.The Sixth Child avoids these pitfall , although toward the end , some of the resolution feel too neat . But it & rsquo ; s still a movie where you identify with everyone . You keep turning over their option in your mind , and will likely think about the character and the story long after the movie end .","' the sixth child ' : a tragic french story of parenthood , poverty - review"

But at the campus , where there wa food for the survivor and she wa with her friend , she found herself able to eat.For month she came to the campus whenever she could , she said , explaining that she wa not working , and wa not capable of thinking about working at that time . & ldquo ; The fact that I wa able to leave my bed wa an added bonus ; the fact that I wa able to drive alone wa an added bonus .

2022-04-11 19:41:24.670,jpost,"For most Israelis , Amir Khoury , a Christian Arab , is a hero.Khoury is the policeman who gave chase earlier this month and helped stop & ndash ; at the cost of his life & ndash ; the terrorist in Bnei Brak before he could kill more than the four innocent civilian he had already slain in cold blood.The Bnei Brak Municipality announced on Sunday that a street in the haredi city would be named after Khoury . Khoury & rsquo ; s father , Jeries , who also served in the police , reacted to the gesture by saying , & ldquo ; We are seeing unity [ between Arabs and Jews ] that we have not seen for year . & rdquo ; For Ayman Odeh , head of the Joint List , Khoury is a humiliation.Why ? Because he served in Israel & rsquo ; s security forces.In a Ramadan greeting Odeh uploaded to Facebook from Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Damascus Gate , where he said he hoped to one day see Palestinian flag flying , Odeh & ndash ; known to complain that the Israeli police do not do enough to stem crime in the Arab sector & ndash ; said all those serving in Israel & rsquo ; s security force should & ldquo ; throw your gun in their face and tell them our place is not with you . & rdquo ; Odeh said he ha met with group of & ldquo ; young Palestinians with Israeli citizenship & rdquo ; from & ldquo ; occupied Arab Jerusalem & rdquo ; who have said they were being harmed and humiliated by the security force . & ldquo ; It is important for me to tell you from here , the Damascus Gate , that it is a humiliation for one of our son to join the security force , & rdquo ; he said.Odeh then called on a & ldquo ; small minority & rdquo ; of Arabs who have enlisted & ndash ; he put the number at a few thousand & ndash ; to leave their job . He said they were & ldquo ; humiliating our people , humiliating our family , and humiliating everyone who come to pray in the blessed Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; So Khoury , for Odeh , is a disgrace . And the historic unity that Khoury & rsquo ; s father spoke about is , for Odeh and his Joint List , a political liability . This is a party that thrives on creating division and enmity between Jews and Arabs , not on fostering any kind of integration and unity.At a time of galloping terrorism , of citizen being shot and stabbed in city street by fanatic whose terrorist methodology is used not only to kill Jews in Israel , but thousand upon thousand of Muslims around the world , Odeh & rsquo ; s message is that those Arabs who are engaged in a battle against this indiscriminate murder are & ldquo ; humiliating & rdquo ; their people.There are many message Odeh could have delivered on the occasion of Ramadan . He could have gone for the traditional : & ldquo ; May the crescent-shaped moon of Ramadan brighten your path toward enlightenment . & rdquo ; Or for the more spiritual , & ldquo ; Ramadan is the month to seek forgiveness for our sin , may Allah accept our prayer and pardon our wrongdoing . & rdquo ; He could have opted to spend his two-and-a-half-minute video talking about how the deprivation of the body during Ramadan is a time to concentrate on bettering the soul and on becoming a better person.Instead , what wa the message of the leader of the largest Arab party in the Knesset ? That Arabs should not serve in the country & rsquo ; s security force & ndash ; security force that also protect them.Odeh , who like to fashion himself a an Israeli Palestinian Martin Luther King , had a message not of harmony but rather of division , of perpetual conflict & ndash ; anything but conciliation , anything but Arabs and Jews living side by side in this country , sharing the space equitably and shouldering part of the responsibility for keeping that space safe.While Ra & rsquo ; am Party head Mansour Abbas , Odeh & rsquo ; s political rival , is trying to improve the lot of the country & rsquo ; s Arab minority by working with Israel and Israelis , Odeh continues to sow nothing but division and enmity.Religious Zionist Party MK Itamar Ben-Gvir ha been rightly accused since the onset of this most recent wave of violence of & ldquo ; dancing on the blood & rdquo ; of the victim , of going to the site of some of the attack and firing up the crowd , tapping into the rage caused by the terrorism to win new followers.Odeh is doing the same thing.The terrorism , and the IDF & rsquo ; s response to it , are Odeh & rsquo ; s cue to fan the flames.Sadly , that seems to be his only political ticket : what Odeh want to do is make sure the Israeli-Arab conflict endures . He see an opportunity to ensure that the discourse between Arab and Jew in this land is not one of integration , one of working within the system to get more for Arab-Israelis , issue that his rival Mansour Abbas speaks about ; rather , he want the emphasis to be on the Aqsa Mosque and Palestinian nationalism.Odeh can & rsquo ; t compete with Abbas on the integration card , on improving the daily life of Arab-Israelis , so he need to keep in the forefront the violence and the conflict and the & ldquo ; occupation . & rdquo ; The & ldquo ; historic unity & rdquo ; that Jeries Khoury talked about is not the stuff that Odeh can cash in on at the ballot box . Odeh & rsquo ; s political oxygen is only conflict and the & ldquo ; evil of Zionism . & rdquo ; This , he belief , is what resonates with his voter , and this is why he must forever put that at the forefront and look for reason & ndash ; such a the recent wave of terrorism and the IDF & rsquo ; s reaction & ndash ; to keep it there .",ayman odeh is toxic against israeli-arab unity - analysis

2023-07-03 20:14:08.270,jpost,"The outcome of the Jenin operation is unknown because no one know how far the IDF is going to go , or how and when West Bank Palestinians and Israel & rsquo ; s enemy , a well a it ally , will react.Some early data point gathered so far have compared it to Operation Defensive Shield in 2002 , however , and also to Operation Break the Wave , which started last March and hasn & rsquo ; t stopped since.So far , the current operation is a far cry from Defensive Shield , when the IDF occupied large swath of the West Bank for extended period of time , with no particular end in mind , and explicitly kept open the possibility of a longer-term stay & ndash ; if it were needed to reduce terrorism.IDF 's month-long operation in the West BankAll in all , the IDF left after about a month , although it did maintain cordon around specific village and continued to go in and out of them in a volume and frequency far above anything it ha done over the past year.That time wa characterized by significant fighting that occurred simultaneously throughout the West Bank , with the IDF encircling and placing under siege then-Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat.More than 100 Israelis were killed , including dozen in one bombing alone , before the operation kicked into gear . Dozens of soldier were killed during the operation , with more than 20,000 reservist called up . About 200 to 400 Palestinians were killed during the operation , with an additional 200 killed the month before . The number of wounded on both side wa high.So far , nothing on the Israeli or Palestinian side currently come close to these number . Yet this operation is qualitatively different from the routine raid and arrest that the IDF , Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) , and Border Police have been conducting under Operation Break the Wave for more than a year.Although a dozen airstrikes did take place , airpower had not been used by the IDF in the West Bank & ndash ; unlike Gaza & ndash ; since 2006 . As well , a full brigade of soldier ha been mobilized & ndash ; a opposed to a small number of platoon or battalion . In term of number , this is a many a thousand of soldier in one case and a couple hundred in the other.IDF 's operation signal a strategic shift with temporary gainsAnother point of difference is that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi have been personally following and managing the operation , minute to minute , instead of the middle management of lieutenant-colonels.The operation would not go on indefinitely , IDF Spokesman Brig . - Gen . Daniel Hagari said Monday , adding that several day wa an option . For context , most operation over the last year lasted under an hour , or a few hour at most . This operation could extend for week or more if needed , Hagari said.In addition , IDF Home Front Command is now on high alert , both in the North and the South , concerned that the operation could instigate rocket fire . With all this , it is not even close to what ha been happening over the last year , and it is a clear attempt to alter the strategic picture , using a grand show of force.Yet in term of the ultimate result , it will likely yield only very temporary tactical achievement for Israel & ndash ; something akin to mowing the lawn , which then need to be mowed again soon after.This is the situation because neither side is really ready for another Defensive Shield , with it high price in life . They also are not ready for a new diplomatic opening that could provide hope for the Palestinian side and douse the popularity of the terrorist groups.IDF 's operation face tactical limitation and generational resistance & nbsp ; As of press time , there were no Israeli death a a result of the operation . This is not only due to talent and luck , but because the IDF is acting very slowly and very strategically in it gun battle . That can not last if the IDF go head-to-head with all the terrorist group over an extended period of time.The IDF can confiscate hundred of bomb and gun , but new one can be made and bought within month . One group of terrorist can be killed or arrested , but another can easily replace them.Top IDF official have repeatedly told The Jerusalem Post that one of the main reason the IDF failed to clamp down on the terrorist wave this past year is that today & rsquo ; s Palestinian teenager and adolescent do not even remember Defensive Shield . They were born into a post-reality of it , and so they are not deterred from fighting the IDF . They have not met the might of an extended IDF operation.This one , without much more force or diplomacy , will not change that very fundamental fact .",will idf 's war on jenin stop wave of terror against israeli ? - analysis

2021-09-09 21:00:01.087,jpost,"Sheikh Bilal Abu Hassan , a mosque preacher from Jenin , wa surprised last week to receive a letter from the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Waqf and Religious Affairs informing him of the decision to fire him . Abu Hassan lost his job because of a khutbah ( sermon ) he recently delivered during Friday prayer at one of Jenin & rsquo ; s mosque and in which he heaped praise on the Palestinian faction , including Hamas , in the Gaza Strip . Referring to the Israel-Hamas war last May , Abu Hassan applauded the & ldquo ; Joint Operations Room , & rdquo ; which consists of various Palestinian faction that operate a a quasi-army against Israel . & ldquo ; Our Joint Operations Room ha unified the Palestinians , & rdquo ; he said from the minbar , a pulpit in a mosque where the imam ( leader of prayer ) stand to deliver sermon . & ldquo ; This is the true meaning of Palestinian national unity . & rdquo ; The mosque preacher in the West Bank are appointed by the PA Ministry of Waqf and Religious Affairs . Every week , the ministry issue a directive to the imam concerning the Friday sermon . The directive includes instruction about the topic the imam should address during the sermon . Occasionally , the ministry also issue instruction regarding the topic that the imam are prohibited from addressing . Those who defy the instruction of the ministry are often punished by suspension or dismissal , a in the case of Abu Hassan . On Wednesday , a Palestinians were voicing support for the six Palestinian security prisoner who escaped from Gilboa Prison and protesting Israel & rsquo ; s punitive measure against the inmate in various prison , the PA Ministry of Waqf and Religious Affairs announced that the topic of Friday & rsquo ; s sermon ( September 10 ) will be : & ldquo ; High Morals in Islam . & rdquo ; The implicit message to the preacher : Ignore the fugitive who escaped from Israeli prison . The last thing the PA want is for preacher who are on it payroll to stand in a mosque and praise , in front of thousand of worshiper , member of Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) . ( Five of the men who escaped are member of the Iranian-backed terrorist group ) . The jailbreak is seen by many Palestinians a an embarrassment not only for Israel , but for the PA too . The escape came at a time when relation between Israel and the PA appeared to be improving , especially after the recent meeting in Ramallah between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Defense Minister Benny Gantz . Now , the PA and it senior official and spokesman are being forced to publicly endorse the PIJ fugitive a & ldquo ; hero & rdquo ; and issue strong condemnation against Israel because of the ensuing crackdown on hundred of PIJ inmate , who are being transferred to other prison . The PA is being forced to toe the line and join the Palestinian public & rsquo ; s campaign of solidarity with the fugitive and the other prisoner because it doe not want to be seen a sitting on the fence or , worse , being in collusion with Israel . The PA ha long been facing severe criticism for it ongoing security coordination with Israel . Moreover , it regularly come under attack for failing to secure the release of prisoner . This week , at the Jenin refugee camp , home of Zakaria Zubeidi , the only Fatah member among the fugitive , even prominent Fatah activist were critical of Abbas because of his alleged rapprochement with the Israeli government and the Biden administration . The activist accused the PA leadership of & ldquo ; abandoning & rdquo ; it supporter in the Jenin area , especially the armed men who are wanted by Israel . To ensure that the mosque preacher abide by the instruction , the PA security force regularly deploy informant to the mosque to listen to the sermon and report to their handler . As far a the PA is concerned , criticism of senior Palestinian official , especially during Friday prayer , is a crime that can even land the perpetrator in prison . The same applies to any preacher who dare to heap praise on Hamas or other group opposed to the policy of the PA leadership . The PA is not opposed to mass demonstration in the West Bank in solidarity with the Palestinian prisoner . But the PA leader also know that an escalation could deteriorate into another all-out war with Israel , something that is likely to further undermine the PA & rsquo ; s credibility and standing and boost the popularity of Hamas and PIJ , a wa the case after the last Israel-Hamas confrontation in May . There are two issue that are considered the most explosive and sensitive among the Palestinians : Security prisoner and Al-Aqsa Mosque . If the Palestinians decide to launch another intifada , it will be over one or both of these issue . The dismissal of Abu Hassan and the continued crackdown on Hamas and PIJ member is yet another sign of mounting tension between the PA and Hamas . The latest tension began immediately after the last war in the Gaza Strip , when thousand of Palestinians took to the street in the West Bank to celebrate Hamas & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; victory & rdquo ; over Israel . Scores of Palestinians have since been arrested or summoned for interrogation for participating in the pro-Hamas demonstration or voicing support for the Islamist movement on social medium platform . The PA crackdown mark the end of a short-lived honeymoon with Hamas that began more than a year ago . The two party have been at loggerhead since 2006 , when Hamas won the Palestinian parliamentary election . The crisis reached it peak in the summer of 2007 , when Hamas seized control of the entire Gaza Strip after toppling the PA . Since then , attempt by Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Qatar and Turkey to end the PA-Hamas rivalry have hit a snag . The administration of former US president Donald Trump , however , ushered in a period of reconciliation between the rival Palestinian party . A plan by the government of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apply Israeli sovereignty to part of the West Bank also accelerated the reconciliation process . Trump & rsquo ; s plan for Mideast peace , & ldquo ; Peace to Prosperity , & rdquo ; and Netanyahu & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; annexation & rdquo ; scheme , which were rejected by both the PA and Hamas a a conspiracy to liquidate the Palestinian issue and Palestinians & rsquo ; national right , prompted the Palestinian leader in Ramallah and the Gaza Strip to resume attempt to end their dispute . In July 2020 , Jibril Rajoub , secretary-general of the PA & rsquo ; s ruling Fatah faction , and Saleh Arouri , deputy chairman of the Hamas politburo , announced that they had reached an agreement & ldquo ; to speak in one voice and under one flag , the Palestinian flag , to build a strategic vision to face the challenge . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; We are now talking about a joint struggle , a campaign on the ground , & rdquo ; Rajoub said , calling Hamas a full partner . & ldquo ; We call on all Palestinian faction to see cooperation between Hamas and Fatah a a historic opportunity for a joint fight to establish a Palestinian state and oppose the Israeli occupation . & rdquo ; Two month later , Rajoub and Arouri held another meeting in Istanbul , to promote the reconciliation between the two party . The meeting ended with an agreement to hold election for the Palestinian presidency and parliament , a well a the PLO & rsquo ; s legislative body , or parliament-in-exile , the Palestinian National Council . Fatah and Hamas leader who later met in Cairo under the auspex of Egypt & rsquo ; s General Intelligence Service agreed on the electoral voting procedure , paving the way for Abbas to issue a decree setting date for the election . As part of the reconciliation process , Hamas formed it own list of candidate for the parliamentary election , which wa supposed to take place on May 22 . The list included 132 candidate from the West Bank , Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem . In late April , however , Abbas announced the postponement of the election on the pretext that Israel had not approved his request to hold the vote in east Jerusalem . & ldquo ; Facing this difficult situation , we decided to postpone the date of holding legislative election until the participation of Jerusalem is guaranteed , & rdquo ; Abbas declared . In response , Hamas denounced the decision , dubbing it a & ldquo ; coup against the path of national partnership and consensus . & rdquo ; Hamas and other Palestinians are convinced that Abbas decided to call off the vote because of his fear that Fatah , which wa running on three separate slate , wa headed toward another defeat , similar to the one in the 2006 parliamentary election . & ldquo ; For them , it & rsquo ; s evident that Abbas used the controversy surrounding Jerusalem a an excuse to cancel the election , & rdquo ; said Palestinian political analyst Amer Ashhab . & ldquo ; Abbas & rsquo ; s decision wa also seen by Hamas a the end of the reconciliation process with the Palestinian Authority . & rdquo ; But other analyst said the defeat of Trump in the US presidential election wa another reason why Abbas decided to delay the election . & ldquo ; Abbas received positive message from the administration of President Joe Biden , & rdquo ; said political analyst and columnist Mohammed Abu Diab . & ldquo ; Had Trump won , Abbas would have proceeded with his plan to achieve unity with Hamas . & rdquo ; Eager to resume contact with the US , Abbas and other Palestinian official in Ramallah welcomed the departure of the Trump administration and signaled their desire to resume their tie with Washington . The PA leadership had severed tie with the US after Trump & rsquo ; s 2017 decision to recognize Jerusalem a the capital of Israel . The departure of Netanyahu from the political scene and the formation of the new government wa also received with a sigh of relief in Ramallah . The restoration of relation between the PA and the US administration and the improved tie between Ramallah and the government of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett saw Abbas move further away from Hamas . The talk about national reconciliation between the PA and Hamas ha been replaced with statement by Abbas and other Palestinian official concerning the need to resume the Israeli-Palestinian peace process . THESE ARE good & nbsp ; time for the PA and Abbas , provided that this week & rsquo ; s mass demonstration in support of the Palestinian inmate do not lead to another major confrontation with Israel . The Biden administration ha revived the talk about a two-state solution a the only way to resolve the conflict and stated it opposition to any step by either side that risk sparking violence or undermining the prospect for returning to the pursuit of two state . Additionally , the Biden administration ha been saying it belief Palestinians and Israelis & ldquo ; deserve equal measure of security , freedom , opportunity and dignity . & rdquo ; This rhetoric , in addition to the resumption of US financial aid to the Palestinians , obviously contributed to Abbas & rsquo ; s decision to again turn his back on Hamas . The Israeli government & rsquo ; s decision to resume high-level contact with the PA leadership is also seen by some Palestinians a another reason behind Abbas steering clear of Hamas . Abbas know that he stand to gain more by aligning himself with the US and Israel than making peace with Hamas , some of whose leader have never missed an opportunity to denounce him a a & ldquo ; traitor & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; collaborator & rdquo ; with the enemy of the Palestinians . For Abbas , an alliance with the US and Israel is tantamount to an insurance policy for the survival of the PA . He also know that such an alliance doe not come without a price , making him less popular among the Palestinians . On the other hand , Abbas is well aware that making peace with Hamas would only spell trouble . He is not in a rush to return to the Gaza Strip and pay salary to ten of thousand of Palestinians . He know that even if he return to the coastal enclave , he and his security force will never be able to disarm the various terrorist group or prevent them from launching rocket and incendiary balloon into Israel . Abbas also know that any deal he strike with Hamas will jeopardize his relation not only with Israel , but with the US and the European Union too . When Palestinian businessman Munib al-Masri lately asked Abbas about his condition for incorporating Hamas into a Palestinian unity government , the PA leader told him that the group must first accept all international resolution pertaining to the Israeli-Arab conflict . Abbas , in other word , demanded that Hamas recognize Israel & rsquo ; s right to exist . Hamas wa quick to reject the demand , accusing Abbas of acting on behalf of the US and Israel to & ldquo ; blackmail & rdquo ; the group into abandoning it ideology and principle . & ldquo ; Hamas is not serious about ending the conflict with Fatah , & rdquo ; said a senior Palestinian official . & ldquo ; Hamas want to continue ruling the Gaza Strip with the hope of turning it into an Islamic emirate . Hamas is serving the agenda of foreign power , including Iran and Qatar , who want to see the Palestinians divided forever . & rdquo ; In many way , it is safe to assume that Abbas is comfortable with the status quo , which absolves him of responsibility for what happens in the Gaza Strip . The security coordination between the PA security force and the IDF also serf a an insurance policy for the survival of the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah . Abbas know that a long a Israel maintains a security presence in the West Bank , Hamas will never succeed in extending it control beyond the Gaza Strip . The current strategy of the PA is to strengthen it relation with the US administration with the hope that such a move would ensure the continued flow of financial aid to the Palestinians . And despite it public criticism of Israel , the PA leadership seems to be relatively satisfied with the new and less hostile approach of the Israeli government . The closer Abbas move toward the US and Israel , the farther he move away from Hamas . This leaf Hamas with one option : enhancing it tie with Iran , Qatar and Turkey a a way of tightening it grip on the Gaza Strip . The split between the West Bank and Gaza Strip , long regarded by many Palestinians a a fait accompli , is likely to continue even in the post-Abbas era because most of the official surrounding him are not known a fan of reconciliation with Hamas .",no escape from the growing palestinian internecine tension

These people are incited , `` he said . `` This person seems to watch Channel 14 often ; I saw a completely incited person .

This is an attempted murder , nothing else . `` The attorney of the suspect in the alleged hit-and-run , Roy Keren , said : `` The case is sad and tragic . . . This wa not an intentional hit-and-run ; apparently , a mechanical malfunction in the electric vehicle caused it to accelerate without the driver 's ability to stop the vehicle immediately while doing everything possible to avoid hitting the protester . ``",protest ramming witness : ' he tried to run over an elderly woman '
2024-06-24 16:35:34.187,jpost,"Opposition member criticized plan for the use of budget excess from 2023 in the Knesset 's finance committee , Monday morning.National Unity MK Orit Farkash-Hacohen came out against rolling the fund over rather than putting them towards war expense , saying that the country is not economically prepared for war in the North , and that rolling fund over to `` pointless `` ministry who do n't know what to do with them doe not make sense . `` We are headed for a war on the northern front when the northern front is not even included in the budget , `` said Farkash-Hacohen . `` In front of our eye we have another pit in the budget that is n't calculated in our expense . The entire Finance Minister 's war budget wa not completed in this committee because of argument about money for kindergarten teacher in the Ofek Hadash [ education reform ] program . `` `` We are talking about advancing an increase of VAT by 1 % , taxing our saving , a budget in the black next year ; and suddenly we have an opportunity in the form of excess from ministry , some of which are pointless , with coalition fund that were not cut , `` she said.As an example , she pointed to the `` 302 million Shekels of excess fund to [ Settlement and National Missions ] Minister [ Orit ] Strock who doe n't know what to do with [ the budget ] so she roll them from year to year . `` The fund should not be automatically transferred , but should be discussed so that they can be best-used for addressing need caused by the war , Yesh Atid MK Vladimir Beliak said in the meeting . `` In what world do you live , that you are transferring 300 million Shekels to Struk ? `` he asked . & nbsp ; `` Where do you live that you are transferring ten of million to [ Regional Cooperation Minister David ] Amsalem 's Ministry , where regional cooperation is the last thing that they have done ? `` `` Let 's talk about each shekel .

2024-05-12 15:42:25.390,jpost,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intends to present to the cabinet a new plan for ultra-Orthodox ( haredi ) conscription into the IDF , just one day ahead of a May 16 deadline for the state to outline it plan to the High Court of Justice ahead of an important hearing on June 2 , Minister-without-portfolio MK Benny Gantz revealed in a video statement on Saturday evening.According to a report by KAN , the prime minister intends to hold a preliminary vote in the cabinet on Wednesday in order to include the plan in the legal filing to the High Court , so that the court refrain from forcing the government to begin drafting all haredi men of military age.Negotiations have been ongoing in recent week between Government Secretary Yossi Fuchs and representative of Israel 's haredi party in an attempt to reach a compromise , which could then be presented to the government and eventually pas a legislation in the Knesset . However , the side have yet to announce that such a compromise ha been reached.Haredi men have enjoyed a legal exemption from IDF service since Israel 's founding . However , the most recent law enabling the exemption wa ruled unconstitutional in 2017 , and after many delay , officially expired on July 1 , 2023 . The government gave itself an adjustment period to come up with a new plan , but that period ended on March 31 , and the state is required by law to begin drafting some 60,000 haredi men of military age into the IDF.Implications of passing draft exemption & nbsp ; The long-awaited conscription plan could trigger a political crisis . On one hand , Gantz in his Saturday video statement repeated his position that he would not support a bill that will continue to grant sweeping exemption to haredi men , and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced in March that he would not support a plan that did not have Gantz 's backing . On the other hand , the haredi party , who are key partner in Netanyahu 's coalition , have insisted that haredi men continue to receive the option to study in yeshivot full time , and also have argued that the IDF doe not enable haredi who do serve to maintain their lifestyle . The departure of either Gantz 's National Unity party or the two haredi party ( United Torah Judaism and Shas ) would likely lead to political instability and even the government 's collapse.Added to this is the ongoing legal case against the government 's delay in drafting haredi men , and against financial support for military-age student in yeshivot . The High Court on March 28 issued a temporary order to halt the financial support and acknowledging that the state wa required by law to draft haredi . The hearing on June 2 , which will be heard in front of an expanded nine-member bench , will debate whether or not to turn the temporary order into a permanent one.Israel Hayom reported on Saturday evening that the government 's plan includes a gradual rise over ten year of a minimum amount of haredi draftee per year , with the goal being to eventually draft approximately half of eligible draftee every year ( some 6,000 & ndash ; 7,000 per year , out of some 13,000 student per year ) . These detail could not be independently verified.Plan still exempts approximately half of haredi from IDF serviceGantz claimed in Saturday 's video that the prime minister wa `` acting in order to bring a plan that doe not promote fair service in the state , harm the IDF draft and Israeli security and resilience . `` Gantz also criticized the timing of the prime minister 's intention to present the plan just two day after Remembrance Day , and accused Netanyahu of `` taking apart Israeli society during wartime for political gain . `` Fuchs , who is facilitating the negotiation between the involved party , refuted Gantz 's claim . In a post on X , he accused Gantz of acting divisively and of criticizing a plan that ha yet to be presented in full.It appeared that Gantz 's criticism of Netanyahu 's bill addressing the crisis of Haredi exemption/integration into the IDF wa less based on having thoroughly reviewed the prime minister 's latest proposal , a much a the fact that Netanyahu ha consistently avoided dialogue on the issue with Gantz along the life of a major reform.Comments by Netanyahu 's cabinet secretary also indicated that the new bill could draw out any solution over a decade , a time period usually viewed a making a reform irrelevant in political term since there will be additional election before anything serious would change.In contrast to Gantz , Gallant ha fallen silent in recent days.His position is that he tried in the recent past to shoot down Netanyahu 's bill which wa trying to repackage an ongoing exemption in practice a a real reform of integrating Haredim into the IDF , but that at this point he can not single-handedly stop it.Furthermore , if expectation are rising for Gantz to quit the government over the issue of Haredim serving in the IDF , Gallant ha made it clear that even if he opposes Netanyahu 's bill , he will not quit.The defense minister belief that his value a the `` adult in the room `` in the current government in which he view Netanyahu a often being pushed around by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich , who are less experienced in world affair , is more important than any statement he might make by resigning , given that the government would still continue.It is also still always possible that four more Likud member could join Gallant to block passage of the bill , but there are no sign that the defense minister ha succeeded in gathering such number .",politician clash over haredi conscription ahead of thursday deadline

2024-04-03 03:52:12.420,jpost,"Ongoing drama in Israel provide ample fodder for budding novelist and playwright : the Saturday night and other demonstration which bring so many people of varied background together ; the difference in treatment of family of hostage by the American and Israeli government ; the number of family whose loved one were murdered on October 7 , who in interview have said that not a single government minister visited them or contacted them in any way to offer condolence ; and how Education Minister Yoav Kisch ha been forced to backtrack on several erroneous decision , the most recent being the Israel Prize.Last week , the Education Ministry published the full list of this year ’ s Israel Prize laureate , who at the closing of Independence Day event will receive their award not in Jerusalem but in Sderot , much to the annoyance of Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion.The list includes technology entrepreneur and Benjamin Netanyahu nemesis Eyal Waldman , whom Kisch reportedly wanted to exclude by making certain change to this year ’ s Israel Prize ceremony . But when Attorney-General Gali Baharav Miara declined to defend his decision in court , Kisch had no choice other than to retract.But the controversy is not yet behind him . Both he and Netanyahu sit on a panel with President Isaac Herzog and other dignitary a each laureate come to the stage to receive his or her prize , and then walk along the row shaking hand and is congratulated by each of the dignitary . Will Netanyahu and Kisch exchange a few pleasantry with Waldman and shake his hand , and perhaps offer a few word of sympathy over the loss of his daughter on October 7 ? Or will they find convenient excuse to absent themselves from the ceremony ? Incidentally , in addition to Waldman , another controversial figure among the laureate will be Sephardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef , who ha spoken out against the haredi draft . Yosef will receive the prize for Torah literature and Jewish law.Three Hebrew University faculty among Israel Prize honoree ■ APROPOS THE Israel Prize , at the Hebrew University , of Jerusalem they ’ re kvelling , because three of the honoree are among their past and present faculty members.Prof . Gershon Ben-Shakhar ha been recognized for his work in psychology research ; Prof . Ya ’ acov Ritov for his contribution to statistic research , and Prof . Hagai Bergman for life science research.In congratulating them , HU president Prof . Asher Cohen said : “ This is no less than an amazing achievement , showcasing the high academic caliber of the Hebrew University , which boast researcher with exceptional ability across all discipline . ” Czech Republic moving embassy soon ? ■ WHEN THE Czech Republic opened an embassy branch office in Jerusalem in March , 2021 , it wa understood that it wa merely a matter of time before the whole embassy would move to Israel ’ s capital , with or without the approval of the European Union . The Czechs have a long history of being among Israel ’ s best ally in Europe . There ’ s a reason that Herzog chose to give Israel ’ s Presidential Medal of Honor to then-Czech president Milos Zeman in July 2022 . There ’ s also a reason that several place in Israel bear the name Masaryk.Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said after the Hamas attack on Israel that transferring the embassy to Jerusalem would be “ a desirable step . ” From recent medium report , it would seem that he is moving in that direction . If so , the Czech Republic will be the first member of the EU to open an embassy in Jerusalem , and the second NATO member state after the US to do so.Trump stay himself ■ LAST WEEK , former and possibly future US president Donald Trump gave an exclusive interview to Israel Hayom reporter Omer Lachmanovitch and Ariel Kahana , who thought it important that Israel hear what Trump had to say.Trump , being Trump , claimed that he had done more for Israel than any other US president . It can not be denied that he did a tremendous amount , but whether he did more than present incumbent Joe Biden is a matter for debate , although Trump will undoubtedly go down in history a the president who moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem.But there ’ s nothing surprising in the fact that he gave his exclusive interview to Israel Hayom , which advertised it for day on end on electronic medium . The late Sheldon Adelson , who launched Israel Hayom in 2007 , wa one of the most generous of Republican campaign donor . Trump showed his appreciation in November 2018 by conferring the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Adelson ’ s wife , Dr . Miriam Adelson , who is now one of the wealthiest woman in the US and the publisher of Israel Hayom.Golden Age of American Jews ? ■ SUBJECTS OCCUPYING attention of journalist working for Jewish publication , or Jewish journalist working for general medium around the globe , are antisemitism , the Israeli hostage situation , Israel ’ s war against Hamas , and how far point of disagreement between Israel and the US and Israel and the EU will be permitted to go.A worrisome April cover story by Franklin Foer in The Atlantic is headlined “ The Golden Age of American Jews is Ending . ” It ha been picked up in whole or in part by various publication outside America , including Yediot Aharonot , which translated it into Hebrew , published it in it financial supplement , Calcalist , and included in the title page of a very long article 24 portrait of prominent American Jews . There are additional illustration throughout.There are slightly fewer portrait on the cover of The Atlantic and mostly of people different from those featured in Calcalist . The cover of The Atlantic also contains several line in Yiddish which do not appear in the Hebrew translation . Printed in Yiddish on the left ear of the page is the statement : “ What doesn ’ t suit America , likewise doe not suit me . What ’ s not good for Jews is also not good for America . ” Then , in a line across the page , above the row of portrait : “ What happened to our golden land ? ” The article wa sufficiently provocative to prompt an online discussion with Foer sponsored by Harvard Hillel and introduced by Harvard Hillel Rabbi Dani Passow.Nineteenth-century Jews considered America to be “ Die goldene medina , ” and for some it certainly wa – almost from day one . But for many Jews it wa a tough ride through several period of antisemitism.But according to Foer there wa a discernible difference between Jews taking on the European way of life and Jews becoming Americans . “ Jews didn ’ t have to accept the devil ’ s bargain [ where ] the cost of citizenship wa assimilation . In the United States , you could be your Jewish self . ” Even so , with only a few exception , most notably in Hollywood , Jews didn ’ t rise to high position till the 1960s . In 1950 , according to Foer , there wa not a single Jewish professor at Yale . By the end of the 1960s , 17 % of the professor at elite American university were Jewish . That ’ s an incredibly dramatic leap in such a short space of time , and what followed wa a golden age for American Jewry in almost every white-collar profession.Foer began researching antisemitism in America long before October 7 . His brother , a religiously observant Jew who life in Brooklyn , called him to tell him of an antisemitic incident that he had experienced . That call led Foer to research antisemitism in America and to reach the conclusion that , for the foreseeable future , the golden era for Jews in America is nearing it conclusion.Ethiopian aliyah remains delayed ■ THE PEOPLE least surprised by the government ’ s failure in a six-month period to bring home the hostage from Gaza are member of Israel ’ s Ethiopian community , who have been waiting for long year to be reunited with relative who were left behind with empty promise that their turn to set foot in the Holy Land would soon come . As horrific a situation a the hostage are in , let u not forget that Avera Mengistu ha been captive in Gaza since September 2014.The issue of the Ethiopian Jews still waiting to make aliyah came up in the Knesset last month , when the delay wa questioned and criticized by Yisrael Beytenu MK Oded Forer , who chair the Knesset Committee for Immigration , Absorption , and Diaspora Affairs , and Yesh Atid MK and former Knesset speaker Mickey Levy , who chair the State Control Committee.At a joint meeting of the two committee , Forer and Levy queried why thousand of people are still stuck in transit camp in Addis Ababa and Gondar , and why Government Resolution 713 to bring to Israel 3,000 of the 14,000 waiting people had not been implemented . The debate will continue after the summer recess of the Knesset.Meanwhile , UJA-Federation of New York ha weighed in on this injustice . Gabriel Sod , the organization ’ s Israel-based director of government relation and medium , ha called on the government to stop it foot-dragging and to bring to Israel 1,226 Ethiopian Jews who have been found eligible . Hundreds of Ethiopian Jewish family have been separated through Israel ’ s bureaucratic ineptitude.One example is Svinor Tarkein , who came to Israel from Ethiopia in 2007 and spent six year serving in the IDF . His grandmother remained in Ethiopia , and an uncle of his who lived in Israel wa murdered on October 7 . Tarkein can not understand why Ethiopian Jews with proven blood tie to Ethiopians already resident or even born in Israel are prevented from joining them.New brain imaging center at Reichman University ■ RECENTLY LAUNCHED at Reichman University by the Rosental-Belachovsky family wa the Ruth and Meir Rosental Brain Imaging Center , which facilitates interdisciplinary research and integrates the cognitive science with medical science a well a field not typically associated with MRI research , such a law , marketing , human-machine interaction , diplomacy , strategy , and management.The center also provides guidance to researcher who are not experienced in integrating imaging into their research endeavor , assisting them from the conceptualization phase to implementation . The scope of research possibility is endless.The center ’ s MRI device is a Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma 3 Tesla , a state-of-the-art research system designed for human scanning , with the capability to produce exceptionally high-quality image . It enables high-grade anatomical , functional , and metabolic scan of various body organs.Established in 2021 a part of the university ’ s Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology , the center wa converted into an independent university entity in late 2023.Founded with the aim of helping researcher working with MRI/fMRI technology , the center play a pivotal role in providing tailored service and an objective window into the brain before , after , or during an activity , which significantly enhances research reliability . The center also offer scanning for interdisciplinary and neurocognitive study conducted by researcher from Reichman University , other academic institution , and external company and start-ups.At present , researcher at the center are engaged in dealing with post-trauma , resilience , and the impact of innovative treatment method , alongside basic scientific research.RU founding president and chairman of the board Prof . Uriel Reichman stressed the importance of the donation of the MRI in contributing to the advancement of the university . “ We are marching towards a substantial expansion of our scope – from interdisciplinarity in the social science to interdisciplinarity in technology and life science , ” he said . “ This significant milestone will already be reflected next year , with the opening of additional laboratory , endeavor in the life science , and the establishment of the medical school . I have no doubt that the interdisciplinary nature of our institution and the investment made in psychology and neuroscience will yield groundbreaking research . ” Expanding on this theme , Dikla Ender-Fox , director of the center , emphasized that “ this contribution by the Rosental-Belachovsky family will pave the way for significant and pioneering research and advancement , particularly at a university that also prioritizes applied research . ” Moral compass ■ SEVERAL HEBREW medium outlet last week carried a headline stating that Netanyahu had lost the north . The headline follows the statement by US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that Netanyahu ha lost his way , and the suggestion that Israel should go to election . This did not sit well with Israelis – including those who agree with Schumer – because it wa interpreted a American interference in Israeli politics.But for student of linguistics , there is interesting food for thought . To find one ’ s way ( at least in the traditional manner ) , one need a compass . In Hebrew , the word for “ compass ” is “ matzpen . ” The word for “ north ” is “ tzafon , ” and the word for “ conscience ” is “ matzpun . ” The p and the f sound are interchangeable , and because Hebrew is generally written without vowel , when one look only at the consonant of the three word , there is an undeniable similarity . This is obvious not only in the spelling but in the meaning . North is the highest point on the compass , and a person ’ s conscience guide his or her decision on issue of morality.Women 's accomplishment ■ REGULAR READERS of The Jerusalem Post will have noticed the extent to which the paper ’ s management took Women ’ s History Month to heart and ha boosted woman leader in numerous field , last month bringing them together at a Women Leaders Summit.Women have reached top rank in more industry than is generally realized.At the summit a woman ’ s entrepreneurship competition hosted by Post and the Luzzatto Group wa won by Alisa Givertz , founder and CEO of Liquid360 , who received the 2024 Next-Gen Women ’ s Entrepreneurship Award.Liquid360 offer technological solution to make company ’ site more secure and ready for any situation.The competition for young start-up entrepreneur took place during the summit at the Google for Start-ups Campus in Tel Aviv .

But after the Government Press Office moved out and went to it current location in the Malha technological park , thing began to disintegrate . Several international television company rented office in what wa then Jerusalem Capital Studios , and used the various service provided by JCS . Some are still there , but JCS is not .

It ’ s amazing how Jews can get their act together during a time of crisis – but the money did not come from Jews alone.For instance , since the October 7 massacre by Hamas and the ensuing war , the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews , headed by Yael Eckstein , ha presented the Association for Israel ’ s Soldiers with $ 4 million to be used for soldier ’ need . The association and the IFCJ have partnered in various initiative since 2005.The association recently arranged for senior member of the board of the IFCJ to visit a battalion of IDF reservist on a day of R & R , which wa made possible through a gift of the IFCJ.The visitor , who included Eckstein ; former congresswoman Michele Bachmann , chairman of the US board Bishop Paul Lanier , IFCJ Canada chairman of the board of director Mark Climie-Elliott , and HaKeren L ’ Yedidut director-general Ayelet Shiloh Tamir , were able to speak with the reservist training on the base and hear about their service throughout the war , while the soldier enjoyed a catered meal , recreational game and musical entertainment.Vegans and Vegetarians flock to Balfour Street ■ VEGANS AND vegetarian will be flocking to 8 Balfour Street , Jerusalem , on Tuesday evening , April 9 , to celebrate the 90th birthday of leading vegetarian advocate Prof .

2021-01-14 21:13:18.087,jpost,"United Nations envoy Nickolay Mladenov , a diplomatic pillar on which the uneasy calm that ha characterized the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the last six year ha rested , quietly left for his home country of Bulgaria at the end of last month . The impact of his departure on the conflict ha not garnered a much attention a that of the tumultuous regime change in Washington and the electoral chaos in Israel . His absence , however , leaf a chasm in day-to-day , back-channel regional statesmanship precisely at a time of diplomatic upheaval . A former Bulgarian foreign minister , he arrived in Jerusalem from a UN posting in Iraq in 2015 at an inauspicious moment in the conflict . He took over what , during the time of his predecessor , Robert Serry , had been the highly contentious post of UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process . For almost six year Mladenov wa a peace envoy without a peace process . From the moment of his arrival and until his departure , there were no direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiation . Until the final month of his posting , a larger Israeli-Arab peace process , which ha now filled Israel with hope , wa absent and largely considered unthinkable . During his first two year , the Obama administration had largely given up on Israeli-Palestinian peace and for the next three , the process remained frozen a both party awaited a plan from US President Donald Trump . In an interview with The Jerusalem Post in 2016 , Mladenov spoke of the limit of his position in light of the current reality , noting that one would have to be & ldquo ; day dreaming & rdquo ; to imagine that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were about to sit down to negotiate . & ldquo ; We don & rsquo ; t believe that , currently , the way thing stand , negotiation are possible , & rdquo ; he said . In the interim , he explained , & ldquo ; our role is to actually figure out how we can create the condition under which such a process can resume in a meaningful manner . & rdquo ; Then he went about showing just how meaningful small , behind-the-scenes step could actually be . He threw out the script of how his office had operated and created a new process that met the reality he saw out his window . The Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University dubbed his form of diplomacy the & ldquo ; Mladenov approach . & rdquo ; Nowhere wa that felt more than in Israel & rsquo ; s conflict with Hamas in Gaza , which had thrice broken out into war & ndash ; in the winter of 2008-2009 , in 2012 and in the summer of 2014 . During his six year in office , Gaza crisis erupted , rocket flew and the IDF struck Hamas target . But each time , just a Israel wa on the brink of war , effective behind-the-scenes diplomacy by his office restored an uneasy calm . This included the eventual neutralization of the Hamas-led Great March of Return , which began in 2018 and sparked weekly and at time daily violent riot on Israel & rsquo ; s border and included the launching of incendiary balloon against southern Israel . Part of his success wa due to the fact that he wa not a stranger to the Middle East and that he came from a small neutral country . He had already visited the region a a foreign minister and had tie with Israelis , Palestinians and Arab country , including the Gulf state . He did not lose those connection , and some of them were enhanced during his time in Iraq . MLADENOV HAD an easy manner about him that made people feel a though he were their friend , even when he wa critical and holding them to task . Former US ambassador Dan Shapiro said , & ldquo ; He did something that others who have held that position have found difficult to do , which is to win the confidence and trust of all the relevant player . & rdquo ; This included , Shapiro said , & ldquo ; the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority , the Arab state , the American and European leader and Hamas . & rdquo ; Shapiro added that & ldquo ; because he had that trust and wa seen a a straight shooter , & rdquo ; he could & ldquo ; call any party out for an action that needed to be addressed or changed . & rdquo ; In addition , Mladenov wa & ldquo ; very creative and quite determined . He wa far more effective than many who have held that position , & rdquo ; said Shapiro . Mladenov not only created a mechanism of communication for defusing crisis situation with Gaza , but he augmented that with linking Gaza calm with increased humanitarian aid , in a way that offered positive incentive that gave Hamas a reason to hold it fire . From the start he breathed new life into the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism , by which construction material wa allowed into the Strip to enable Palestinians to rebuild home destroyed during the 2014 war . He helped move forward project on water and wastewater and electricity , including increased funding . In 2018 , he expanded those effort , bringing in extra aid , including cash for needy family , from Qatar . Mladenov wa vocal about his idea , speaking often to the Israeli public at conference and event , including those organized by civic society group , by way of strengthening on the ground effort toward peace . He wrote tweet and blog post and gave monthly briefing to the UN Security Council . At a time when few were saying anything , he wa always saying something . Mladenov sided with the Palestinians on the idea of a two-state solution at the pre-1967 line , a he warned against a one-state reality to the conflict . He wa a persistent opponent of settlement activity , which he saw a a stumbling block to the conflict . But he also supported Israel in it criticism of Hamas and the PA support of terrorism and incitement , putting that critique in writing in the 2016 Quartet blueprint to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , which he helped author . During his six year , Mladenov wa often the first UN official to condemn terrorist attack or to chastise the Palestinians . He also called repeatedly for Fatah-Hamas unity and urged the PA to maintain it security cooperation with Israel and to accept the tax levy Israel had collected for it . At time he wa accused by Palestinians of what they perceived to be a stance that wa too pro-Israel . Mladenov had not initially believed that Israeli-Arab peace wa possible prior to resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . His opinion were diametrically opposite to those of the Trump administration . Still , he ha been credited with helping the US see how the threat of Israeli West Bank annexation could create a window of opportunity for Israeli-Arab normalization . Under the rubric of the Abraham Accords the Trump administration launched in August , Israel opened tie with the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Morocco and Sudan . & nbsp ; The success of those initiative wa helped , in part , by the calm that existed in Gaza , which Mladenov had helped maintain . Had there been a war in the previous two year , the option for normalization deal might not have existed . Shapiro said that Mladenov & ldquo ; didn & rsquo ; t resolve the conflict , obviously , but helped contain it , ameliorate it [ and ] helped resolve and prevent crisis when they popped up . & rdquo ; German Ambassador Susanne Wasum-Rainer said , & ldquo ; He wa tireless in his effort to make small step that could eventually lead to bigger progress . He never allowed himself to get frustrated at any obstacle , and remained always convinced that the painful reality of the conflict for the people living here gave the UN and the international community an obligation to stay engaged . & rdquo ; She added , & ldquo ; Even during all these year without negotiation between the two side , he succeeded to uphold the international consensus on the need for a two-states solution . & rdquo ; IN SUMMING UP his own time in Israel in a blog post he wrote before he left , Mladenov said , & ldquo ; I have worked on upholding the international consensus that the goal is of a two-state solution , I have warned of the danger of the eroding status quo , supported intra-Palestinian reconciliation effort , and , most of all , focused on preventive diplomacy . & ldquo ; Together with Egypt , and with critical support from Qatar and others in the international community , the United Nations ha played a pivotal role in preventing another devastating war in Gaza . I have spoken out against injustice . I have condemned terror , & rdquo ; he wrote . He added that it wa a mistake to view the conflict from the narrow lens of territory . & ldquo ; This conflict is not just a conflict over land , for both people have the right to call Israel and Palestine their home . It is not only a conflict over history & ndash ; personal and collective . It is a conflict over the very right of two nation to coexist , & rdquo ; he wrote . & ldquo ; Perhaps today is not the time for big international initiative , but the time for step & ndash ; maybe small , sometimes maybe bold & ndash ; that protect that goal of two-states , & rdquo ; Mladenov wrote . He urged Israelis and Palestinians to seize common threat such a the COVID-19 pandemic and opportunity such a those provided by the Abraham Accords to find a way to return to the negotiating table . Seen a a rising star at the UN and a a possible UN secretary-general , he had planned to leave for a UN post in Libya . But at the last moment he bowed out for family and personal reason , and will be replaced by veteran diplomat from Noway Tor Wennesland . He wa so vocal and so omnipresent , speaking at small NGO event and shaking hand with head of state throughout the region , that it almost seemed a though he had become a permanent fixture to the conflict . The small achievement on the Israeli-Palestinian track over the last six year have depended on a large cadre of diplomat , but Mladenov is credited a the behind-the-scenes official who maximized those effort to keep the wheel of a two-state solution slowly churning . He wa a vocal envoy of peace on behalf of both Palestinians and Israelis , who ha left the stage at a time when his calming influence would have been essential to maintaining horizon of possibility for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace .","nickolay mladenov : israeli , palestinian lose envoy of peace"

Hamas member Katan and Mitzri were the killer , and Hura wa a key accomplice.While the death of the terrorist mean they can not be interrogated , The Jerusalem Post received indication that the evidence against them for the Dee murder wa multifaceted , with Hamas itself claiming that the terrorist were important operational members.A statement by the IDF and Shin Bet described an extensive gunfight between the security force and the terrorist , and the Post received indication that drone were used a well.IDF official : Nablus operation completed at ' unusually fast speed ' A senior IDF Central Command officer said the operation wa completed with unusual speed within an hour and not the usual several hour . & ldquo ; With less talent and exactness [ in intelligence and operation ] , more IDF personnel or Palestinian civilian could have been hurt , & rdquo ; or the terrorist might have escaped , he said.Eight Palestinians were injured , he said , adding that they were not innocent bystander . According to Palestinian report , a fourth Palestinian civilian bystander , Ziad Shuviri , wa killed during the operation . The Post wa unable to confirm the accuracy of either report.The senior officer said the speed with which Israel brings terrorist to justice , whether it take day or week , versus month and year , can serve either to deter terrorism or help terrorist recruit more people when the response take too long . & ldquo ; There are no safe-haven city in the West Bank [ for terrorist ] & ndash ; not Jenin , not Nablus , nowhere , & rdquo ; he said.Overall , & ldquo ; we are still in a very challenging period , & rdquo ; he added . & ldquo ; The level of shooting attack is still very high . & rdquo ; The senior officer also implied that Hamas a an organization wa investing more in the current wave of terrorism than it wa before , when most of the attack were being carried out by unaffiliated & ldquo ; lone wolf & rdquo ; attackers.The final round of intelligence collection started early Thursday when Israeli intelligence received confirmation of the location of the terrorist , including a tip by certain Palestinian force about the terrorist & rsquo ; vehicle , according to some reports.The senior officer did not deny the use of drone in the operation , but he downplayed their role and emphasized the role of the ground forces.IDF to use armed drone for targeted killing in West Bank ?

It kept the drone tactic under the public & rsquo ; s radar.The military usually sends in foot soldier to detain suspect or engage in combat in such case without using drone beyond collecting intelligence . The use of drone in the West Bank could mark a new tactical shift if it were used , possibly to avoid larger friction with Palestinian civilian present in the residential area , while maintaining the ability to carry out a more targeted attack.Until now , drone have only been used only to collect intelligence and sometimes to fire missile to kill terrorist in Gaza , while kamikaze explosive drone have reportedly been used against Iranian target , but not in the West Bank . & ldquo ; After the terrorist attack , there wa a significant intelligence effort [ that ] led to locating the hideout in the Nablus Kasbah , & rdquo ; the joint statement by security force said . More intelligence wa received early on Thursday that led to the terrorist & rsquo ; location , including the seizure of two M-16 rifle and a Kalashnikov gun , it said.The security force said they would & ldquo ; continue to act with determination to thwart all terrorist threat & rdquo ; directed at Israelis.Some soldier reportedly were lightly wounded , but a senior IDF officer denied those report .

Rashid Ali indoctrinated the country with Nazi propaganda ; child in Iraqi school were taught to praise Hitler and that Jews were a treacherous enemy , and Radio Berlin had regular broadcast in Arabic . & nbsp ; Supported by the Nazis , he aimed to rid Iraq of Britain and to gain access to the huge oil reserve in Kirkuk . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; An order wa issued to Iraq & rsquo ; s air force to destroy the British RAF base in Habbaniyeh , west of Baghdad . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Although the RAF wa only equipped with plane left over from World War I , the bombing campaign failed drastically , with Iraq & rsquo ; s inept air force shooting down several of it own plane . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; On May 30 , Rashid Ali wa forced to flee . With British ground troop advancing on Baghdad and with no leader , the Jewish community wa left in a perilous position . & nbsp ; Two day later , on June 1 , the observant Jewish community wa preparing for Shavuot , oblivious to a huge mob of rampaging Muslims shouting , & ldquo ; Cutal al yehud ! & rdquo ; ( slaughter the Jews ) . & nbsp ; With no organized resistance , many of the Jews who survived unscathed bribed Iraqi policeman to stand guard . & nbsp ; But the violence worsened during the night , and the mob soon numbered in the ten of thousand , targeting every Jewish home in the city . The mufti had made this task simple by advising the chief rabbi to ask the still-trusting Jewish community to paint a red hamsa ( palm-shaped amulet used a a sign of protection ) on the outside of their home . & nbsp ; While the violence continued unabated , British troop were waiting on the outskirt of the city , forbidden to enter . & nbsp ; By the second day of fighting , the mob & rsquo ; s violence had spread to such a degree that Muslim shop were also being looted , and a curfew wa eventually called at 5 p.m . Remaining violator on the street were shot , and a relative calm wa soon restored . & nbsp ; WHEN THE State of Israel wa created , life in Iraq became unbearable , with public hanging of prominent Jews that shocked the community to new depth . When the Iraqi government finally allowed Jews to leave in 1950 on condition that they forfeit their nationality and all their money and property , the entire community registered en masse , leaving only 2,000 Jews by 1952 . & nbsp ; Sarah Ehrlich contributed to this report .",farhud pogrom commemorated with virtual candle-lighting ceremony

But Hamas and PIJ know that they can & rsquo ; t reach any deal with Israel without the blessing of their patron in Iran . In the past few day , Hamas and PIJ leader spoke to Iranian official about the latest flare-up of violence . It is unclear , however , whether Tehran is interested at this stage in a ceasefire . Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , who is based in Qatar , told Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif during a phone call on Monday that effort were being made & ldquo ; on the diplomatic and field level to halt Israeli assault on our people in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip . & rdquo ; Haniyeh wa referring to Egyptian and Qatari mediation effort to reach a ceasefire with Israel . Haniyeh wa obviously seeking Iran & rsquo ; s approval of a possible truce that could be reached under the auspex of Egypt and Qatar . Hamas and PIJ official have told Egyptian , Qatari and other mediator that they would be ready to stop their attack on Israel once Israel stop it military offensive in the Gaza Strip . Musa Abu Marzouk , deputy head of the Hamas politburo , said on Wednesday that Egyptian and Qatari mediation effort have thus far been unsuccessful . Abu Marzouk & rsquo ; s statement came amid unconfirmed report that Egypt wa planning to send an Egyptian security delegation to the Gaza Strip to hold talk with leader of Hamas and PIJ about way of reaching a new ceasefire with Israel . Abu Marzouk told the Khaleej Online news website that Hamas wa holding contact with several Arab and Islamic country about the situation in the Gaza Strip . & ldquo ; There wa talk about mediation effort that are appreciated by our brother in Egypt and Qatar , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; We appreciate their care for our Palestinian people , but these mediation effort have not culminated in a return to calm until now . & rdquo ; Abu Marzouk accused Israel of & ldquo ; igniting & rdquo ; the fighting . Israel , he said , & ldquo ; must stop and retreat from it step , a it is the only party that bear full responsibility . & rdquo ; The Hamas leadership told the mediator that it message wa clear , which is to & ldquo ; strengthen the position of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem and at al-Aqsa Mosque , and the steadfastness of family threatened with expulsion from their home in Sheikh Jarrah , & rdquo ; Abu Marzouk added . The Hamas official wa later quoted by Palestinian news website a saying that the Europeans have also contacted his group to explore the possibility of reaching a ceasefire with Israel . & ldquo ; The Europeans contacted u and asked u to stop firing short-range missile [ at Israel ] or else they will not participate in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip , & rdquo ; Abu Marzouk said . & ldquo ; I told them we will stop our short-range missile and use long-range missile . & rdquo ; Abu Marzouk did not provide detail about the identity of the Europeans who reportedly contacted Hamas . Meanwhile , Hamas on Wednesday admitted for the first time that a number of it senior military commander were killed in Israeli airstrikes . In a statement , Hamas & rsquo ; s military wing , Izzadin al-Qassam Brigades , named Bassem Issa a one the commander killed by Israel . It said that Issa and & ldquo ; a group of his brother , the leader and mujahedin ( warrior ) were martyred during the occupation & rsquo ; s aggression . & rdquo ; Abu Hamza , a spokesperson for PIJ & rsquo ; s military wing , al-Quds Brigades , said on Wednesday that the Gaza-based terror group will & ldquo ; continue the jihad and will not retreat , regardless of the price and sacrifice . & rdquo ; He said that his group fired 100 missile toward Tel Aviv at 5:00 a.m . & ldquo ; We were able to respond to the continuation of the aggression and the targeting of civilian and mujahedin , & rdquo ; Abu Hamza said in a statement .

He said in World War II the US did n't choose it enemy , it went after Japan , Italy and Germany all together . & nbsp ; `` We just ca n't pick and say Iran is bad , Russia is okay and China is bad .

2024-03-27 21:59:50.563,jpost,"On Wednesday , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leader of the haredi party failed to come up with a new compromise on the controversial issue of the haredi exemption from IDF service that would enjoy legal backing from Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara.The attempt at a new compromise were aimed at convincing the Supreme Court & ndash ; ahead of a midnight deadline & ndash ; to give the government a few more month to have the plan pas into law . The attorney-general is the government & rsquo ; s legal representative in the Supreme Court , and she requested that the court give her until 2:00 p.m . on Thursday to file the government 's official response.According to Israeli medium outlet , a leaked draft of the response revealed that Baharav-Miara intends to claim that the state is no longer authorized to avoid recruiting yeshiva student , and should begin the process of drafting them from April 1 onwards . Regarding state funding to yeshivot , the A-G is expected to request that the funding cease but not immediately , so a to give the yeshivot time to adapt to the change.The government & rsquo ; s proposal ha been viewed a too weak because the haredi have refused to commit to specific quota number of draftee per year or to any financial or criminal sanction for those who do not comply . Baharav-Miara said that without some minimal number and sanction , it would be hopeless for her to try to defend the bill before the High Court of Justice.It wa expected that the government would ask for an additional postponement , given the inability to reach a deal to keep the government intact , with some report suggesting a request for an additional 10 day . It wa unlikely that the High Court would give the government much of a postponement , if any , and in the past , the High Court ha often only granted a shorter extension than whatever the government had requested to keep up the pressure.The court could also just let the issue play out at the hearing scheduled for Thursday and demand answer from the government throughout that hearing . In the most extreme case , the court could order an immediate universal draft until the government put in place an alternative.Fuchs blame attorney-general 's officeCabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs wrote a letter to government minister on Wednesday in which he blamed the Attorney-General & rsquo ; s Office for the government & rsquo ; s inability to pas a decision on time . Fuchs argued that the A-G & rsquo ; s office initially refused to support the decision for what it described a a & ldquo ; procedural & rdquo ; reason , namely that the decision did not include an opinion by the defense ministry . On March 24 , however , the A-G & rsquo ; s office again refused on the same ground , saying that the lack of a defense ministry opinion served a a & ldquo ; legal impediment . & rdquo ; Fuchs argued in the letter that the A-G & rsquo ; s office contradicted itself and had not made it clear in advance that the defense ministry opinion wa legally obligatory . He added that the reason the defense ministry opinion wa unattainable wa because Defense Minister Yoav Gallant wa not participating in the procedure . & ldquo ; The door to the vault of government approval ha been locked by the Attorney General & rsquo ; s Office and there is no key since , from a technical standpoint , it is impossible to receive the professional underpinnings from the defense ministry , & rdquo ; Fuchs wrote . & ldquo ; Until this moment , the Attorney General & rsquo ; s Office ha not pointed out any core problem or problem whatsoever in the government & rsquo ; s decision and ha not raised a & lsquo ; black flag & rsquo ; over it , & rdquo ; Fuchs accused.Gallant refuted the claim that his ministry had not cooperated , saying in a written statement soon after Fuchs & rsquo ; s letter wa published that the allegation were & ldquo ; biased and false . & rdquo ; According to Gallant , & ldquo ; every request that wa received regarding cooperation with the professional echelon in the defense ministry or a piece of data regarding the conscription law wa approved and will continue to be approved . & rdquo ; However , the defense minister repeated a prior pledge that he would only support a bill that wa supported by & ldquo ; the entire & rdquo ; emergency government , which includes Minister-without-Portolio Benny Gantz , head of the National Unity Party.Opposition leader MK Yair Lapid said in response to Fuchs & rsquo ; s letter , & ldquo ; The government & rsquo ; s wonderful ability to evade any responsibility is impressive , and tonight , who is to blame that there is no conscription law ? The attorney general ? You got it wrong : The blame is on those who are attempting to whitewash draft-dodging and discriminate between group based on blood . & rdquo ; A source from United Torah Judaism expressed the party & rsquo ; s frustration with the prime minister . & ldquo ; He [ Netanyahu ] signed an agreement . We wanted to pas [ a new conscription bill ] before the government & rsquo ; s formation ; he delayed . We agreed [ to pas the bill ] before the budget [ passed on May 23 ] ; he delayed . If he want a government , he must ensure that yeshiva student can study Torah , & rdquo ; the source told The Jerusalem Post in a text message.Gantz also threatened earlier this week to leave the government if an unsatisfactory conscription bill pass into law.In term of viable alternative and compromise that the government could adopt , there is a spectrum of idea that other party have presented , and there could also be variation on those proposals.The closest way to a compromise would be some variation on Gantz & rsquo ; s proposal of all haredi having to do national service , with a more symbolic number serving in the IDF.This would not truly address all of the IDF service inequality that have angered the public for decade , but it would at least show the majority of the population that the haredi were ready to contribute to the national destiny in a physical and quantifiable way . ( Haredim claim they care for the spiritual sustenance of the nation ) . Also , if more Israelis from other sector were being pulled out of necessary job , the haredi stepping in with national service would cover some of that gap.Advocates of the Gantz compromise say it would temper some economic impact and start a social transformation within the haredi community by connecting and contributing more to the nation.In practice , IDF source have said they can not integrate all of the draft-eligible haredi and that it would probably take year to do so , if at all doable . They explained that there are too many social and educational issue to work through to take in haredi in anything other than gradual number . & nbsp ; Above a certain volume , it is not even clear that the IDF want to spend the amount of resource necessary to integrate so many Haredim at once.The lack of an agreement about how to solve the crisis is part of what ha continued to allow the consistent rejectionist haredi position to prevail over the last several month , not to mention for decade before October 7 . & nbsp ;","israeli gov't in crisis a netanyahu , haredi party fail to reach idf draft deal"

2021-06-12 23:13:16.720,jpost,"Incoming prime minister Naftali Bennett will be sworn in on Sunday in the shadow of last month & rsquo ; s Gaza war , domestic Jewish-Arab unrest and amid the threat of renewed IDF-Hamas hostility , particularly over Jerusalem . & nbsp ; The sequence of event that are likely to unfold in the coming week , let alone the coming month , would be a test under fire for any prime minister , but will present a unique challenge for this particular government because of it unorthodox composition . & nbsp ; The new coalition headed by Bennett of the right-wing Yamina Party and incoming foreign minister Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid Party also includes left-wing party and the Arab Islamist Ra & rsquo ; am Party . & nbsp ; It & rsquo ; s a coalition that ha an unprecedented ideological range and many of the decision that it make are likely to involve principled compromise by one or more of it member . & nbsp ; The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the most contentious and divisive arena for this coalition and issue relating to it are expected to be one of it weakest link . & nbsp ; It & rsquo ; s precisely here , on the Israeli-Palestinian front , the new coalition will be tested , both within it first week and it first month in these four way . & nbsp ; 1 . Evyatar outpost evacuation & nbsp ; Defense Minister Benny Gantz , who will retain his role in the new coalition , is poised to evacuate the West Bank outpost on Monday , less than 24 hour after the government is sworn in . The outpost wa built last month in the aftermath of a Palestinian terror attack at the West Bank Tapuah junction , in which Yehuda Guetta , 19 , wa killed . It wa erected on a spot that settler had first attempted to settle in 2013 in the aftermath of a Tapuah junction terror attack in which Evyatar Borovsky , 31 , wa killed . & nbsp ; The reconstruction of the outpost named in Evyatar & rsquo ; s memory wa largely ignored by the IDF . Within a month & rsquo ; s time , close to 50 family had moved onto the site . & nbsp ; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s plea to Gantz to allow the community to remain wa ignored , so only direct intervention by Bennett can prevent it evacuation . & nbsp ; Should Bennett intervene , he would likely anger the left-wing flank of his coalition , a well a some of it centrist member , such a Gantz , who head the Blue and White Party . & nbsp ; Such an evacuation , however , risk inflaming the West Bank and setting off a chain of violent event . Past outpost evacuation were often followed by violent retaliatory attack by right-wing Jewish extremist against Palestinians . This would come at a time when Hamas is already attempting to inflame the West Bank . & nbsp ; 2 . The Flag March & nbsp ; Police on Friday approved a parade route for a right-wing Flag March set for Tuesday , just one day after the anticipated West Bank outpost evacuation . & nbsp ; The annual event is typically associated with Jerusalem Day event that mark the celebration of the city & rsquo ; s unification in the aftermath of the Six Day War , in which Israel captured the eastern part of the city from Jordan and subsequently annexed it . & nbsp ; During Jerusalem Day last month , however , marcher were prohibited from following their traditional route through the Old City & rsquo ; s Damascus Gate and the Muslim Quarter , and were instead expected to head through the Jaffa Gate . Hamas fired seven rocket at Jerusalem during the march , thereby officially bringing it to a halt . This month , march organizer had sought to hold the march along it original route and in the end brokered a compromise with the police by which they would dance with flag by the Damascus Gate that open into the Muslim Quarter . & nbsp ; The area in front of the gate ha been one of the city flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence . Police closure of the area briefly a a place of Palestinian gathering in April during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan wa one of the initial spark that led to May & rsquo ; s violent outbreak . & nbsp ; An Israeli flag dance by the Damascus Gate , which for the Right is an important symbol of sovereignty over the city , is similarly expected to ignite renewed Palestinian violence . & nbsp ; 3 . Palestinian eviction in Jerusalem & nbsp ; There are four existing land issue in Jerusalem that could lead to the eviction of thousand of Palestinians from their home in three east Jerusalem neighborhood . & nbsp ; The one that captured both medium attention and that of Hamas last month wa the fate of some 28 family in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood . The High Court of Justice ha yet to decide whether to weigh in on the matter or to allow for the eviction to move forward . No date ha been set for it decision . & nbsp ; But date do exist for additional case . The attorney-general is expected by the end of June to issue an opinion on a land case in Silwan & rsquo ; s Batan al-Hawa that could impact at least 700 Palestinians . & nbsp ; Another land case regarding al-Bustan in Silwan that could impact more than 1,000 Palestinians ha been delayed until August . Some 13 family , however , could be in danger of losing their home , irrespective of that ruling , because they fall under the dictate of the Kaminitz Law , which block them from seeking any additional legal recourse . & nbsp ; One such Palestinian family wa already given a notice last week that he ha 21 day to destroy half his home , otherwise the municipality would move to knock down that portion of his abode . It & rsquo ; s a demotion that could equally spark violence and the pending eviction that neighborhood have been under intentional scrutiny . & nbsp ; Lastly , the issue of pending eviction in the Walaja neighborhood of east Jerusalem is also due back in court on June 21 . & nbsp ; The Right ha viewed each of the case a land issue . The one in al-Bustan and Walaja involve municipal plan for park . The case in Sheikh Jarrah and Batan al-Hawa involving property dispute between Palestinians and Jews . & nbsp ; But they are seen within the larger context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and placed within the prism of the battle for sovereignty in Jerusalem , with the Left and the Palestinians believing that the eviction are an attempt by the city to seize control of Palestinian neighborhood for Jewish project and resident . & nbsp ; The neighborhood battle have sparked tension and violence , with the European Union and the US weighing in on behalf of the Palestinians . Hamas ha also threatened violence a a result , and the issue of Sheikh Jarrah , in particular , wa one of the spark that led to May & rsquo ; s violence . & nbsp ; 4 . Gaza & nbsp ; The IDF-Hamas 11-day war ended on May 21 , but it & rsquo ; s unclear if the calm is a lull in the war or the end of this round of violence . Hamas ha already renewed it threat of more rocket fire with regard to the Flag March and there exists a real chance it could make good on it threat . & nbsp ; Bennett and Lapid & rsquo ; s coalition could be in the position in it first week of deciding whether and how to retaliate should that happen . It would mark the first time that Israel would have a coalition with divergent view on how to handle Hamas rocket . & nbsp ; When Netanyahu became prime minister in 2009 , Hamas had been in charge of Gaza for less than two year , having ousted Fatah in a bloody coup in 2007 . The initial Gaza policy and the first Gaza war occurred under former prime minister Ehud Olmert & rsquo ; s watch . & nbsp ; The bulk of the Gaza policy , however & ndash ; including the 2012 and 2014 war , a well a the border restriction on good & ndash ; ha been set by Netanyahu . It wa one of the area of consensus within his government . The disagreement that existed centered around the question of whether Israel had been hash enough , rather than too lenient . & nbsp ; Bennett , who often criticized Netanyahu for not doing enough on Gaza , particularly with respect to the tunnel threat , will now have to decide how harsh a response he would authorize . & nbsp ; Even without violence , other question must immediately be answered , particularly with regard to what type of good can enter Gaza and what mechanism can be put in place to ensure that Hamas can not divert material for military use . & nbsp ; The term of the calm between the IDF and Hamas that is now in place have yet to be set . Egypt is mediating indirect talk . It is still attempting to finalize those detail while at the same time attempting to create a permanent ceasefire that could include the return of the remains of two IDF soldier and the release of two Israeli citizen held by Hamas . & nbsp ; All these issue must now be dealt with by the Bennett government , with the possibility that the failure to find a satisfactory response could lead to renewed violence . & nbsp ; Egypt ha also chosen this time to become more involved in Gaza , a move that could potentially lower the possibility of renewed Hamas rocket fire , but which may lead to tension point with Israel .",bennett @ @ @ s first four under-fire test on the israeli-palestinian conflict

2022-06-10 19:59:24.543,jpost,"Fifty-five year after the 1967 war , the status of the West Bank ( aka Judea and Samaria ) and of it Palestinian Arabs resident remains unclear , temporary and officially disputed.Because the war & rsquo ; s outcome wa unexpected , Israel & rsquo ; s government at the time did not have a ready framework for the future . In the best of Jewish tradition , minister and pundit spent week , month and then year debating the issue , waiting in vain for the Palestinians to respond substantively . & nbsp ; For more story released for the 55th anniversary of the Six Day War , click here.In this vacuum , some Israeli group created fact on the ground that evolved into settlement and city on ancient Jewish biblical site , while the army established position that , in some instance , became town . The result wa chaotic , with no strategic or political coherence . Unlike almost every other country , Israel doe not have clear border and operates two parallel legal system & ndash ; one for pre-1967 Israel , and another for the resident of the post - & rsquo ; 67 territory.Another unplanned result is the gradual morphing of the land from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River into a single political entity , in which the Palestinian and Jewish population of approximately the same size are locked into wave of terrorism and response.For the Palestinians , the 55-year status quo keep alive the illusion of moving the clock back to 1947 , abetted by massive international support for a unique and mythical & ldquo ; refugee & rdquo ; status . The image of a single state in which half or more of the population is Palestinian , and where Jews ( Zionists ) eventually disappear like the Crusaders , is far more appealing than a & ldquo ; two-state solution , & rdquo ; which would acknowledge the legitimacy of Jewish sovereignty , regardless of borders.While many Israelis have become accustomed to the stalemate , for outsider & ndash ; including many Jews & ndash ; Israel is presented by the NGO industry in cartoon-like portrait of colonial settler , apartheidists and serial killer of journalist , accompanied by the slogan and myth of international law . When Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh wa killed in Jenin , Israel wa automatically accused of & ldquo ; cold-blooded murder , & rdquo ; ignoring the absence of evidence . In part , this demonization reflects hostility to Jewish empowerment & ndash ; in other word , antisemitism & ndash ; regardless of border , and reinforced by NGO propaganda campaign . The post-1967 image , however inaccurate and unfair , make this easier.In parallel , after more than five decade , ten of thousand of family living outside the 1949 & ldquo ; Green Line & rdquo ; face outbreak of chaos and uncertainty . Disputes over land ownership lead to year of legal proceeding and unpredictable court decision . This absurd situation is unimaginable for people living a few kilometer away , on the other side , in & ldquo ; sovereign & rdquo ; Israel.None of these observation are new & ndash ; indeed , they should be obvious . Not obvious at all is what can be done in 2022 to replace the status quo with a better and realistic framework , if one can be found . The search for alternative that avoid the drift and end the chaos is critical for the future of Israel and Zionism.The goal here is not to propose another imaginary peace plan & ndash ; there are plenty of these gathering dust on physical and virtual diplomatic and academic shelf . Rather , my objective is to contribute to a renewed Israeli debate on option and alternative to the status quo , based on where we are now , in June 2022 . The hope is that through a substantive discussion anchored in political realism , Israel can move beyond the trap of continuing chaos leading to a single non-Zionist state.Diplomatic Dead Ends : 1967-2022Before considering alternative , a brief summary of previous effort is worthwhile , at least to avoid some of the illusion and mistakes.Immediately after the 1967 war , euphoric Israelis , who feared the worst just a few day before , were suddenly able to enter Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Old City and visit the ancient biblical site that had been previously closed to Jews . A return to the narrow armistice line ( drawn in green on map ) that had prevailed since 1949 wa , and remains , unthinkable.Unlike Egypt and Syria , there wa no international border in the West Bank to serve a a basis for negotiation & ndash ; Jordan & rsquo ; s Arab Legion had occupied this territory for almost 20 year , including eastern Jerusalem , and allowed fedayeen to launch murderous raid into Israel . Going back to the previous situation wa a non-starter & ndash ; the question wa , and remains , what should replace it ? In addition to holding Jerusalem , official agreed that the Jordan River would remain a Israel & rsquo ; s eastern border , with a buffer and access zone in the Jordan Valley . But from here , the view diverged . Foreign Minister Yigal Allon presented a plan in which small area such a Gush Etzion ( from which Jews were expelled in 1948 ) would be incorporated . But most of the West Bank would revert to Jordan , noting that : & ldquo ; From a demographic standpoint , a Jewish majority will be kept/maintained , which would allow Israel to exist a a democratic Jewish state , based on the principle of the Zionist vision . & rdquo ; In contrast , minister-without-portfolio Menachem Begin adamantly rejected foreign sovereignty over any part of the Land of Israel , including Judea and Samaria & ndash ; the biblical term that were also used during the British Mandate . However , while agreeing with Allon on demography and Zionism , he rejected annexation , even a prime minister a decade later . Begin & rsquo ; s alternative wa autonomy for the & ldquo ; Arab population in the Land of Israel , & rdquo ; including control of education , finance , service and other sector & ndash ; everything except security and foreign policy.Neither Allon & rsquo ; s nor Begin & rsquo ; s proposal went beyond the debating stage , primarily because the Palestinians were only interested in turning the clock back to 1947 & ndash ; in other word , the elimination of Israel . Nothing caused them to abandon the & ldquo ; all-or-nothing & rdquo ; approach and consider pragmatic compromise , such a a & ldquo ; two-state solution & rdquo ; or a federation with Jordan.IN THE POLICY vacuum , the Israeli presence in these area gradually and chaotically increased . Periodically , another attempt at change would start & ndash ; for example , in 1987 , then-foreign minister Shimon Peres negotiated secretly with Jordan & rsquo ; s King Hussein in London & ndash ; but this wa another dead end.The Oslo Accords , signed in 1993 and accompanied by a White House extravaganza , marked the most sustained effort , including the creation of the Palestinian Authority , which governs more than 90 % of the Palestinian population . To Israelis , Oslo wa presented a embodying the & ldquo ; land for peace & rdquo ; formula , leading to a permanent status agreement and presumably two state within five year . The term & ldquo ; end of conflict & rdquo ; wa used frequently , and the demographic threat to Zionism seemed to be averted.But to Palestinians , PLO leader Yasser Arafat marketed Oslo a a short-term tactical measure , to be renounced once the benefit had been realized . The massive UNRWA & ldquo ; refugee & rdquo ; support system remained intact , and the incitement and terrorist attack continued and even increased in the form of mass terror directed , or at least approved of , by Arafat . Israelis recognized that on the other side , nothing had changed . And Israel & rsquo ; s improved relation with the so-called & ldquo ; international community & rdquo ; evaporated quickly when the IDF moved to counter Arafat & rsquo ; s war.The next effort to end the stalemate took place in 2005 , when prime minister Ariel Sharon unilaterally & ldquo ; disengaged & rdquo ; from Gaza and from two small civilian location ( & ldquo ; settlement & rdquo ; ) in Samaria . Two year later , the Hamas terrorist organization took control of Gaza , followed by the acquisition of thousand of rocket and missile , and the construction of massive terror tunnel . Sharon became incapacitated in 2006 , Israel failed to destroy the nascent Hamas war machine and discussion of further unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank came to a halt , particularly with the election of Benjamin Netanyahu in 2009.But Netanyahu also understood the difficulty inherent in an infinite stalemate , leading him to support the initiative for unilateral annexation ( & ldquo ; extension of sovereignty & rdquo ; ) . Details were not revealed and no official map were made public , but the discourse focused on incorporating the major settlement and the strategic area of Area C ( including the Jordan Valley ) . However , the effort became mired in Israeli electoral politics a well a strong international opposition , and in 2020 , it wa officially halted in the context of the Abraham Accords.As this brief history demonstrates , after 55 year , the temporary status quo , with all of it weakness , continues . At the same time , the default option of a single political entity between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River , with roughly equal population and the implication for Zionism , also remains & ndash ; and a noted , is the Palestinian & rsquo ; s favorite . These problem will not disappear , and a Israelis , we have the obligation of continuing to look for better options.A Strategy of Political RealismWith this dismal history , it is not surprising that many Israelis have given up . The long drift and it implication are not included in the election platform of any of the main party , and that is precisely the problem . It play into those who are not exactly supporter of Zionism and see the evolution of a one-state framework a the best path to their objectives.To move forward by learning from the failure , a new strategy is long overdue , anchored in political realism and concrete Israeli interest , a distinct from hope , faith or ideology . Realism requires the careful analysis of the relative potential cost and benefit of different option , including continuing the status quo , based on security ( military capability , defensible border ) ; Zionism and demography ( a viable Jewish majority ) ; and the perception of Israel from the outside ( public diplomacy and image ) . On this basis , and unlike Oslo and the other experiment , I suggest starting from the end point & ndash ; Israel & rsquo ; s urgent need to determine our border . Once we examine , debate and then decide on the area we need to hold and where Israel & rsquo ; s and Zionism & rsquo ; s interest are best served by exiting , the path necessary to reach this outcome can be considered.Beyond maintaining the integrity of Jerusalem , particularly the Old City and it sacred site , the core pragmatic requirement is to maximize security and minimize control over and responsibility for the Palestinian population . In Israel today , about 80 % identify a Jewish a compared to 20 % Arabs . Among the world & rsquo ; s other nation-states based on a dominant ethnic , religious or linguistic group ( a distinct from inherently multi-cultural country ) , a minority of 20 % is already considered quite high , particularly when that minority ha recidivist claim . Borders that would reduce the Jewish majority to 60 % , for example , would add significant strain to the Zionist Jewish Hebrew-speaking core.In examining other basic element , there is already wide agreement on the need for full control of the strategic Jordan Valley and the main access corridor to defend it . Similarly , the settlement bloc adjacent to the pre-1967 Green Line and within the separation barrier are readily incorporated into Israel , without including a large Palestinian population . There are also a few exception & ndash ; sizable settlement located in non-contiguous area , such a Ariel and Beit El . But with population of 20,000 and 7,000 , respectively , abandoning them is politically unrealistic.THE REMAINING issue concern the future of Area C & ndash ; which , under the Oslo accord , remains , at least in theory , under full Israeli control . Extending from Jerusalem east to the Jordan River , and north along the Jordan Valley , this land is important strategically , and ha a small Palestinian population . & nbsp ; However , in the absence of a coherent policy , the Palestinians and their European support team are busy creating their own settlement & ndash ; precisely in order to disrupt Israeli requirement . The Palestinian & ldquo ; village & rdquo ; that have been created in key location like Khan al-Ahmar and Masafer Yatta , including fictitious backstories to persuade outsider of their authenticity , are attempt to foreclose the option of retaining this territory . The more time that pass before deciding which part of Area C should become part of Israel , the more difficult this process will become.The final dimension concern perception . For some Israelis and Diaspora Jews , the most painful aspect of the post-1967 status quo is the image of the Jewish state a an occupier , portrayed a brutally denying the Palestinians their own state . This is the basis for campus Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions resolution and other denunciation of Zionism.The question is whether demonization would decrease significantly if the status quo wa replaced with declared border , particularly if these were recognized by the United States and at least some European country . Would the Jews who have become hostile to and alienated from Israel because of the 55-year & ldquo ; occupation & rdquo ; move to a more positive relationship with Israel ? On these question , the evidence is unclear . The image of Palestinian weakness and victimization , in contrast to Israeli power , will not change regardless of any move in the West Bank , and Israel will still be blamed . However , there is reason to expect that among those not committed to the Palestinian cause and anti-Zionism , the demarcation of border would reduce the hostility . Nevertheless , based on a realistic assessment , the potential change in perception of Israel based on the setting of clear border and an end to the temporary post-1967 & ldquo ; occupation & rdquo ; should not be considered a deciding factor.In summary , while the result are far from certain & ndash ; and changing the status quo after 55 year will be difficult to accomplish , particularly in the face of intense ideological opposition & ndash ; the greater danger to Israel and Zionism come from continued drift and chaos . & nbsp ; The longer we allow the illusion of temporary arrangement to fester , the more difficult it will be to deal with the result . ■ The writer is emeritus professor of political science at Bar-Ilan University and president of NGO Monitor .

2024-04-30 18:08:35.823,jpost,"Ministers to the right and left of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued dueling threat on Tuesday to leave the government over the possibly impending decision of whether or not to move forward with a deal with Hamas to release some of the hostage being held in Gaza.The statement came after US official said on Monday that new progress had been made in negotiation for a & lsquo ; humanitarian & rsquo ; deal to release between 20 to 40 hostage , in which Israel reportedly would suspend it plan to enter Rafah , the last major Hamas stronghold that the IDF ha yet to attack , a well a enable Gazans to return to Gaza City and release hundred of Palestinian prisoners.The far-right flank of Israel & rsquo ; s government , Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir pressed Netanyahu to shun the deal and move forward with an invasion of Rafah and threatened to leave the government if the prime minister decided otherwise.In a video statement following a closed-door meeting with Netanyahu on Tuesday afternoon , Ben-Gvir said that the prime minister had promised that Israel would invade Rafah , that the war would not end , and that there will not be a & ldquo ; reckless & rdquo ; deal.He added that he believed that Netanyahu & ldquo ; understands what the consequence are if these thing do not happen , & rdquo ; hinting that he would leave the government if such a deal wa made.Smotrich , in a press conference , demanded that Netanyahu not wave a & ldquo ; white flag & rdquo ; of surrender by agreeing to the Egyptian-brokered deal . He said that Israel wa facing a fork in the road with & ldquo ; no middle & rdquo ; , in which it needed to choose between & ldquo ; decisive victory & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; defeat in the war and humiliation , & rdquo ; and said that he wa willing to pay a & ldquo ; political price & rdquo ; if Netanyahu decided to move forward with the deal .

2024-03-14 22:43:30.633,jpost,"The last week ha been an anatomy of a spiraling brawl between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden.First , there wa the & ldquo ; hot mic & rdquo ; moment last week in which Biden , in an incident that many thought wa scripted , wa heard telling politician that he wanted to have a & ldquo ; come to Jesus meeting & rdquo ; with Netanyahu.That wa followed by Biden & rsquo ; s attack on Netanyahu on Sunday , when during an interview with MSNBC he said the Israeli Prime Minister & ldquo ; is hurting Israel more than helping Israel . . . it is contrary to what Israel stand for , and I think it & rsquo ; s a big mistake . & rdquo ; On Monday a US Intelligence Assessment report speculated that Netanyahu could be overthrown . In speaking about that report before a Senate committee CIA Director William Burns said , & ldquo ; I worry that Netanyahu & rsquo ; s conduct in the war threatens to undermine support for Israel in the long term including in the US . & rdquo ; A senior Israeli official responded by accusing the Biden admiration of attempting to overthrow Netanyahu & rsquo ; s government.On Thursday , in a prolonged speech before the Senate , it Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-NY ) called for new election to replace Netanyahu charging that he wa an obstacle to peace and arguing that he and his & ldquo ; extremist government & rdquo ; can not remain in place once the war wind down.He even appeared to hint at conditioning military aid , a sentiment once expressed only by politician on the left-wing flank of the Democratic Party , such a Senator Bernie Sanders ( D-VT ) . It wa a speech that vastly expanded the narrative to one that extended beyond Netanyahu and Biden , to include the entire Democratic Party.That Schumer is the highest-ranking Jewish politician , a centrist within the party , and an avid Israel supporter , made the blow even harsher.Israeli outcry fall flatIsraeli politician were quick to decry US interference in the democracy of one of it closest ally , a tried and true refrain used for such moments.It fell someone flat , however , in light of the impact Israel & rsquo ; s policy are having both on antisemitism in the US and the upcoming US Presidential elections.One could see Schumer & rsquo ; s speech within the context of US domestic politics , a a sign of how nervous the Democratic Party is about retaining the White House in November and the impact the Gaza war could have on Biden & rsquo ; s reelection chance versus his adversary , former US president Donald Trump.One could even see it a the start of the Democratic messaging , now that Trump and Biden this week have clinched enough support to become their party & rsquo ; s presumptive nominees.Opponents of the Gaza war in America often refer to it a & ldquo ; Netanyahu & rsquo ; s war , & rdquo ; scapegoating him a the cause of the conflict rather than Hamas.Netanyahu , who wa already at odds with Biden and the Democratic Party over his judicial policy before the war , had already been viewed a a person-non-grata in Washington.Now it appears that instead of turning Israel into a pariah , they are turning him into one.Once Netanyahu & rsquo ; s biggest problem wa that he didn & rsquo ; t have a Washington invite , now it is that the Democrats are being blunt about wanting to overthrow him.Democrats will explain to their voter that they support Israel , not it government and that if needed , they will not hesitate to show Israel some tough love.It & rsquo ; s a message that of course play well for Republicans who have historically embraced Netanyahu , known for his strong relationship with Trump.Senator Tom Cotton ( R-AR ) called Schumer & rsquo ; s comment & ldquo ; inappropriate & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; offensive . & rdquo ; Republicans who were expected to campaign on strong support for Israel , now have extra fodder for their arguments.Those who worried about the interplay between the Gaza war and the US election , now have seen the opening act of what will likely be an increasingly contentious Democratic-Republican rift over Israel.The Gaza war and the ensuing Israeli-US diplomatic battle over it will likely make or break the political career of politician on both side of the ocean and both side of the aisle in Washington.But when the dust ha settled and the election season is over , the overall Israeli-American relationship will have taken a hit . Those tie are strongest when Israel remains a bipartisan issue.This week & rsquo ; s drama is a warning shot across the bow , of how a raucous and fateful election could create a Jerusalem-Washington crisis .",netanyahu a pariah in washington ? that ’ s a crisis for israel - analysis

Then , like so many old building , it stood in a state of neglect for several year . It is now being partially restored a an integral feature in a development plan for luxury residence that will be built by Yossi Avrahami.The starting sale price per unit is NIS 3,200,999 .

Usually , the period prior to the actual event is spent chatting and networking beneath the pergola leading to the main hall . Assorted refreshment are served in plentiful supply.But when President Isaac Herzog last week hosted an iftar [ Ramadan fast-breaking ] dinner for Arab mayor , ambassador of mostly Muslim-majority country , and family whose loved one were still being held hostage in Gaza , there were no pre-dinner refreshment because Muslims fast during the month of Ramadan , and the iftar feast of breaking the fast is held after sundown . According to tradition , the fast is broken by eating a date that is sweet and slightly juicy.Some of the guest had never been at the President & rsquo ; s Residence , and a special tour wa provided for them.Just a they do for the Independence Day reception for diplomat , the Herzogs came out approximately half an hour before dinner to be photographed individually or in group scene with their guest .

2023-12-15 01:51:48.687,jpost,"The war in the Gaza Strip is continuing for it third month and Israeli military casualty are mounting . In an interview with The Media Line 's Felice Friedson , the Israel Defense Forces international spokesman , Lt . - Col . Jonathan Conricus , discusses the short - and long-term goal of the war and say Israel is paying a heavy price , but it goal remain unshaken : Hamas must be toppled , he say , and the hostage being held in Gaza , who still include 17 woman and child , must be returned . Israel ha no other choice.Conricus say the Israeli army ha exposed hundred of meter of tunnel , some of which are very sophisticated . Many of the tunnel lead to home , and house after house is filled with weapon , explosive , and rocket launcher . One possible scenario for destroying the massive underground city is flooding it with seawater , an option Conricus didn & rsquo ; t dismiss . & ldquo ; At the end of the day , & rdquo ; he tell The Media Line , & ldquo ; these tunnel will hopefully be the undoing of Hamas . & rdquo ; The Media Line : Lt . - Col . Jonathan Conricus is the international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces . Thank you so much for taking the time to be with me here at The Media Line.Lt . - Col . Conricus : Thank you for having me , Felice.TML : On the day that Israel declared war on Hamas , those speaking on her behalf stressed that the path to victory would be a slow one , deliberate and costly . Now , some 68 day into the conflict , observer are amazed that rocket continue to fly into Israel , and that the Hamas fighting remains pretty lethal . What `` unexpecteds `` have you encountered in the last two month ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : So , we & rsquo ; ve been fighting for 68 day , since the 7th of October , and a we said from the beginning , even before we started ground operation in Gaza in order to dismantle Hamas , we said that we understand and know that it is going to be a long and difficult fight , that unfortunately we are going to have to pay a price in blood in order to achieve our goal , and that it will not be easy , but that our resolve is very clear.And all of u , soldier in the IDF , and officer , commander , the High Command , all understand that we have to dismantle Hamas in order for Israeli civilian to be able to go home.Now , we have seen Hamas continue to operate throughout the war , and we see that they still retain certain rocket firing and combat capability . Unfortunately , yesterday we had a mass casualty event in Shejaiya [ in the northern Gaza Strip ] where 10 Israeli soldier were killed from the Golani Brigade and our elite aerial rescue unit , our tactical Air Force unit [ 669 ] . So there are still pocket of resistance in northern Gaza , and the fight isn & rsquo ; t over there . There are still rocket launch and there are still tunnel , and there are still terrorist there . Of course , greatly degraded , but still there . And in southern Gaza , specifically in Khan Yunis , the fighting is ongoing and it will take a lot of time and a lot of effort in order to dismantle Hamas , but we shouldn & rsquo ; t confuse time and patience with a lack of resolve.The resolve is very clear , and we are going to defeat Hamas . There is no other option.TML : Lt . - Col . Conricus , looking at the bloodshed , the loss of life of your soldier , did you underestimate , did the IDF underestimate , the power of Hamas ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : I think what we can say safely is that Hamas ha prioritized their military capability over everything else , and we can see a our force advance and a we clear area , house , neighborhood , and part of city from Hamas terrorist after we defeat them and dismantle the enemy activity there , what we expose is hundred of mile of tunnel , hundred , almost a thousand , tunnel shaft . Some of them are very high-tech and high-level and a high finish of infrastructure . And we find house after house full of weapon , IEDs , explosive , rocket launcher , and anything that Hamas could get their hand on.So what I think I can see is that I think it & rsquo ; s clear where Hamas priority have been . They definitely have not been developing Gaza , caring for civilian , building civilian infrastructure , school and hospital and mosque and road and clinic . No . It ha been in furnishing themselves with tunnel and buying and smuggling weapon so that they can go on their continued jihad against Israel . That will now be brought to an end.Hamas will be dismantled , and a our force on the ground advance , we uncover what Hamas is leaving behind . We & rsquo ; re documenting everything , and we & rsquo ; re also sharing it with the world so that everyone can see where international aid ha gone , where it wa supposed to have gone above ground , and where it evidently ended up underground in the hand of Hamas.TML : This ha been going on for year , the smuggling of weapon , but do you believe the international community actually belief that today ? You might be saying that here , and on many other international program , yet public opinion doesn & rsquo ; t necessarily say that they agree with the reality on the ground.Lt . - Col . Conricus : I think that the polling indicates not quite what you say because I see very solid support among [ the ] US population , lot of sympathy towards Israel , the Israeli government even , and definitely Israelis . And there & rsquo ; s a distinction between those three.And I think , according to the poll that I & rsquo ; ve seen , an overwhelming US majority , and I & rsquo ; ve seen poll of Western country a well , an overwhelming US majority support Israel & rsquo ; s quest to dismantle Hamas based on what they & rsquo ; ve seen , what Hamas did on October 7th . The atrocity , the murder , rape , the brutal execution , and the burning of corps and all of those atrocity Hamas did that seem distant now.It & rsquo ; s been more than two month , but it & rsquo ; s still very fresh in Israeli collective memory . People saw that , and people understand what monster Israel is dealing with , and therefore people all around the world support Israel in our quest to defend ourselves . And I understand that there are certain elite , and there are editor and there are politician and people for whom it doesn & rsquo ; t fit with their worldview and agenda that Israel should be allowed to defend itself and to care for itself and for Israelis to live safely within their internationally recognized border without fear of being under persecution , rape and murder.But that & rsquo ; s fine . They & rsquo ; ll continue to harbor their negative view , and we & rsquo ; ll continue to build our country , defend ourselves , and defeat our enemy a we have been doing since 1948.TML : The United States wa very strong in supporting the Israel Defense Forces & rsquo ; action in Gaza . There is a bit of a shift . You see President Biden putting on some very strong pushback at this point and he & rsquo ; s saying that [ Israel ] ha to pull back . He & rsquo ; s telling everyone [ to ] wrap it up in some form . How is this going to impact what the IDF is going to do in the coming week ? What & rsquo ; s the pressure point here ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : I don & rsquo ; t see one , and on the ground in the IDF that is not the perception that we have . What I see in news event and what I see the president saying is , I stand with Israel , and I support Israel , and Israel need to get rid of Hamas . Those are clear word that I understand.I see a lot of journalist trying to corner the president and get other statement out of him , but I see a president steadfast in his support for Israel , unflinching and unmoving , and I think that is tremendous . That is the leadership that is so extremely important in time of war . And I see various other important American official , including senior spokespeople like [ John ] Kirby taking a very clear moral position on what need to be done , defeat Hamas , bring the hostage home , and do it in such a way that it minimizes collateral damage and damage to civilian , which is what we are doing.We do listen to what our ally and friend around the world are saying . We do take into account the criticism that is voiced , and we do try to adapt , where applicable , our tactic on the ground in order to accommodate that , and of course , we communicate what we are doing on the battlefield to the world , so that the world can see how we are fighting , and also , very importantly , what type of enemy we are fighting . How the enemy us cynically the civilian at their so-to-say disposal that they have in Gaza because it & rsquo ; s really how Hamas look at civilian Palestinians.They think of them a something disposable that they can use , in order to get public opinion swayed against Israel and for Hamas , and in some case , it work and some people are calling for cease-fire , and some people are adopting Hamas & rsquo ; talking point . I think that & rsquo ; s very unfortunate , but at the end of the day , our resolve is very clear.We understand what need to be done , and we also understand that really , frankly , we don & rsquo ; t have a choice . If we do not defeat Hamas , our people , Israelis , can not go back to live safely in their home , and that is a result that is unacceptable . And therefore we will continue to fight until Hamas is defeated and our hostage returned.TML : There are still a lot of hostage left in Gaza . Are you closer to getting any of them out ? There were those in the IDF that attempted to bring two back ; they brought two hostage body back , and unfortunately others were killed . [ Former Chief of General Staff ] Gadi Eisenkot , his son wa killed in that action . So what is it going to take ? Is it going to be a constant race to see how you are going to get the hostage out , and yet you might lose more men in doing so ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : It is a tremendous challenge . A tactical challenge . It & rsquo ; s a very difficult mission to deal with , because of how cynically Hamas is using the hostage a bargaining chip and a human shield . We have said very clearly from the beginning and continuously that we are going to spare no effort in getting our hostage back , even if it mean to conduct tactical operation which will put soldier at risk . It is our commitment and our duty to bring our hostage back.If it can be done through diplomatic mean , great . If it can not be done through diplomatic mean , then we will do it in any other way that is possible . At the end of the day , our moral and professional obligation is to bring our people back.TML : What are the number currently ? How many woman are being held today in Gaza ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : As far a I know , there are 135 Israelis still held in Gaza , out of which 17 are woman and children.TML : Does that include the hostage body that just came back ? Is it down to 134 ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : I know 135 . That is the latest number I have based on the latest information.TML : Was it 16 in term of woman at this moment ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : As far a I know , we are talking about 17 woman and child . I could be mistaken by one . These are moving figure after all , but in any case , the very important thing is that Hamas , they themselves violated the agreement that they pushed so hard in order to achieve in return for a temporary cease-fire or a pause in operations.They were supposed to return 10 live Israeli civilian , woman or child , every day . They failed to do so . They violated the term of the agreement , and then they also started firing . And there is a lot of speculation a to why they did that . I & rsquo ; m not going to speculate about it , but a lot ha been said about it.But at the end of the day , contrary to Hamas claim , there are at least 17 woman and child still held in Hamas captivity , 68 day after the war started.TML : The Wall Street Journal just came out with a story that you are flooding the tunnel . It & rsquo ; s definitely something that ha been discussed . Is there anything that you can share about this with the concern that it can hurt the fresh water that the Gazans will need ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : Yeah , you know Hamas ha been digging tunnel for many year , and we have been developing different countermeasure and technique in order to deal with tunnel , both those tunnel that were dug into Israel what we call terror tunnel in order to infiltrate into Israel , and also underground infrastructure that they have inside Gaza which is really the backbone of their combat network.I can & rsquo ; t go into detail . I can say that we are looking at different capability and different component . We want to turn the tunnel from an asset that Hamas ha really to a liability and eventually to their graf , and that is our intention.We are taking everything into consideration . The location of Israelis who may be held captive in certain area , and other consideration ; one of them you mentioned . But at the end of the day , these tunnel will hopefully be the undoing of Hamas.TML : Looking ahead , is it too early to look ahead for an end game ? Where will the Palestinian people be left ? How will the Israeli border be secure ? There ha to be a strategy that is being discussed at the moment.Lt . - Col . Conricus : I & rsquo ; m sure there is . Yes , and it & rsquo ; s an important part . The IDF is part of the discussion at the cabinet and government level . We voiced our input when asked , when solicited . And at the end of the day , the IDF will implement the directive given by the government.I hope , a an Israeli , that a good and long-term solution can be found , one that first and foremost ensures the security and the sense of security for Israeli civilian that hopefully soon will be able to go back to their home , rebuild their community . Despite the heavy loss that they & rsquo ; ve sustained , despite the damage to their beautiful community , they & rsquo ; ll have the power , they & rsquo ; ll find the power.And with the help of the state and other people who will be helping , also the resource in order to rebuild those community , and hopefully make them grow beyond what they were before . That is really reliant first and foremost on security being available and stable for those civilian to feel safe in order to return there.And then I hope that the international community will see it fit to join in and help , for once fundamentally change the situation in Gaza . We will free Gaza of the terrorist organization that ruled with an iron fist , a heavy hand , over Gaza for the last 17 year , and that will be an opportunity for positive , more advanced force in the region , for nation in the region to invest in what & rsquo ; s happening and hopefully bring about a positive and sustainable future for Gaza.I care mostly about Israeli civilian and our security , but I also understand that if there & rsquo ; s prosperity and stability and education for human value and perhaps even democracy on the other side of the border , that & rsquo ; s probably a good thing for u a well . So I am hopeful that that will happen , and I & rsquo ; m hopeful that there will be international partner who will see it fit to rise to the challenge and do something good for a change when it come to Gaza.TML : What are the biggest obstacle that the IDF is facing now a they & rsquo ; re trying to wrap up this war , particularly in the north ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : Yeah , I don & rsquo ; t think we & rsquo ; re quite there yet . Mentally , we are definitely not thinking about wrapping up . We are knee-deep in fighting , and there still is a lot of heavy lifting to be done . Hamas still ha combat capability in southern Gaza and still need to be eliminated.We still need to take out the leadership , their command and control , and to dismantle and take away their military and administrative and financial capability . So that & rsquo ; s still ahead of us.In the north , if you & rsquo ; re referring to Hizbullah , then there is also a very significant challenge . As I said before regarding Gaza , I think it & rsquo ; s very clear that we can not ask our civilian to return to their home and to be at risk of reliving the atrocity of October the 7th that happened along the Gaza border . And that the security situation need to change.The Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said so very clearly when he spoke with local leader . Before we ask you to go back , before we tell you that it & rsquo ; s safe to go back , we will make sure that it & rsquo ; s safe and that the situation on the ground will not go back to what it wa on October the 7th.Obviously , the first choice that Israel [ can take ] , or the first option that we will entertain , is not the kinetic military violence one . But if we are left with no other choice , if diplomacy fails , and other option will fail , then of course Israel will have to deal with the situation and will have to deal with the presence of this Iranian proxy at our doorstep hundred of yard away from Israeli community . That is unacceptable , and it will not be the reality after the war.Let & rsquo ; s hope that people , nation , and institution that have an interest in the safety of Israelis and the integrity of the state of Lebanon will intervene soon enough , so a to avoid unnecessary bloodshed and destruction and the horror that a war between Israel and Hizbullah may entail.TML : Videos are circulating showing Hamas taking over humanitarian aid that & rsquo ; s designated for their own people . What can you add to that in term of what you & rsquo ; re going through in trying to get people to the right place , suggesting where it might be a safe zone , and also the obstacle there in term of getting humanitarian aid to the population ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : Hamas color are shining through , and it & rsquo ; s another example of how they have absolutely no regard for Palestinian civilian . They are just using them a cannon fodder , a human shield , and a pawn in their political effort against Israel . That & rsquo ; s very cynical , but it & rsquo ; s very obvious for anybody who is honest enough and can see.Yeah , so the true color of Hamas are showing . It & rsquo ; s evident that they absolutely have no regard for civilian , or Palestinian civilian . They continue to use them a their human shield and a expendable asset in their political game against Israel.We see them looting UNRWA warehouse . We see them taking over humanitarian truck and convoy . We see them stealing fuel . We see them stealing food and medicine that is intended through the generous aid of the US and the help of Egypt and many other part of the international community they are intended for good humanitarian purpose . And many around the world hope that it will get to their civilian addresses.But at the end of the day , Hamas ha one goal . Their goal is jihad , holy war against Israel . They want to annihilate Israel . They want to do the October 7th massacre again and again and again , and for that aim they have no problem taking humanitarian aid , with stealing fuel , or with taking food that is intended for Palestinian child in hospital in Gaza and bringing underground into their tunnel for their fighter to have instead of civilian . So it & rsquo ; s abundantly clear.We & rsquo ; ve been saying all along that Hamas abuse the civilian population . Our hope is that more and more people around the world will see reality and acknowledge the fact that Hamas is violating everything that is supposed to be holy , and any of the basic tenet of humanity . They are committing crime against humanity on a daily basis.And I hope , really hope , that [ the ] UN and other humanitarian organization will finally come around and speak the truth about what & rsquo ; s happening in Gaza and call Hamas out for what it is : a terrorist organization that brutally abuse the civilian population . And it is about high time that UNRWA and other organization call [ out ] Hamas for what it is and start helping u save Palestinians from the horror of warfare and get them out of the battle zone , provide them with international humanitarian aid , and make sure that it doesn & rsquo ; t go into the wrong hand of Hamas.TML : The clock is ticking , and the family of the hostage are deeply concerned that they may not see their loved one . It & rsquo ; s a big difficulty for the Israel Defense Forces , especially now when you are pushing forward with possibly flooding tunnel . What do you do ? How do you secure those hostage at this moment ? Lt . - Col . Conricus : As I said , it & rsquo ; s a very very sensitive topic , and an extremely complex and very challenging mission . Because of the sensitivity , I can & rsquo ; t go into the exact detail of the tactic of it . What I can say is that it is a top priority of the IDF to get all of the hostage back . We spare no effort [ in ] intelligence , manpower , [ and ] resource in locating the hostage and trying to bring them home.Unfortunately , one effort that we conducted a few day ago ended with u only being able to return the body of hostage , but we will continue to collect intelligence , devise plan , and where feasible , execute plan in order to get the people back.We are aware of the situation , and I think that one thing that should be said is that for 68 day these Israelis have been held in inhumane condition and the Red Cross ha not yet found the ability or the political will to actually go implement their mandate and visit these hostage . Many of them [ are ] woman , child and civilian , but soldier have right a well under the Geneva Conventions . All of them are entitled to a visit by the Red Cross to make sure that they are receiving medical help , that they are safe , and that their basic need are taken care of.That is what & rsquo ; s supposed to happen . Sadly , it ha not yet happened , and it wouldn & rsquo ; t be a minute too soon once the Red Cross actually get access and implement it mandate.TML : Lt . - Col . Jonathan Conricus , international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces , thank you for your time . And I wish you strength.Lt . - Col . Conricus : Thank you . Thank you , Felice .","gaza war must dismantle hamas , tunnel flooding on table - idf spokesperson"

2024-04-21 00:19:33.920,jpost,"On March 22 , Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that Israel would be taking control of 10 km . of land previously not under it authority in the West Bank & ndash ; the disputed territory the world call the & ldquo ; West Bank . & rdquo ; Smotrich announced , & ldquo ; While there are those in Israel and the world who seek to undermine our right over the the West Bank area and the country in general , we are promoting settlement through hard work and in a strategic manner all over the country . & rdquo ; This announcement largely escaped mainstream and even Israeli medium but wa highlighted by Arab medium outlet around the world.As The Washington Post reported , & ldquo ; If Israel confiscates land around Jerusalem , all the way to the Dead Sea , there will be no future for a Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem , & rdquo ; said Hamza Zubiedat , a land right activist for the Ramallah-based Ma & rsquo ; an Development Center . & ldquo ; This is where a Palestinian capital wa supposed to be located , according to the American and European talk . & rdquo ; While Zubiedat & rsquo ; s reaction wasn & rsquo ; t factually accurate , it speaks to the Palestinian objection to Israeli expansion in the West Bank.The American government strongly object to Israeli building in the West Bank.American long-held policy wa not to state an opinion on the legality of Israeli settlement in the West Bank.Former president Donald Trump changed American policy , maintaining that settlement weren & rsquo ; t inconsistent with international law . Current US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reversed American policy and declared that Israeli settlement are inconsistent with international law . Secretary Blinken recently said , & ldquo ; Our administration maintains a firm opposition to settlement expansion , and in our judgment , this only weakens & ndash ; and doesn & rsquo ; t strengthen & ndash ; Israel & rsquo ; s security . & rdquo ; Settlement legitimacyThe Israeli government maintains that settlement building is legal and encouraged . Israeli prime minister from the Left , including David Ben-Gurion and Yitzhak Rabin , to the Right , including Menachem Begin and Benjamin Netanyahu , considered the West Bank historic Jewish land . It is a much part of the land of Israel a Tel Aviv and Netanya & ndash ; if not even more.the West Bank are considered the heartland of historic Israel . Israel & rsquo ; s long history on the land , it intrinsic connection to the region , and the absurdity of claiming that Jews are prohibited to live somewhere simply because they & rsquo ; re Jews , lends legitimacy to Israeli expansion of settlement . No excuse nor justification need to be given for Israeli settlement , just a none is given in response to Arabs who claim Jews can & rsquo ; t live in Jaffa or Tel Aviv.The US government and the European Union ( EU ) see a larger issue in rebuilding settlement than international law . The Americans believe the only solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the two-state solution . This plan envisions an Israeli and a Palestinian state living side by side , in peace . Settlements are built on the land the global community envision being a Palestinian state . In their estimation , Jewish settlement forestall , and could eventually end the possibility of implementing the two state solution . Many accuse Israel of building settlement specifically to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.In 1937 , the British Peel Commission offered a two-state solution , and the Arabs rejected the idea . The Arabs did so again in 1947 with the United Nations Partition Plan . In subsequent year , the Palestinians rejected countless offer of autonomy or statehood if they would end the conflict by signing a peace deal with Israel.Never one to miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity , the Palestinians have rejected every peace deal offered by Israel.They have had plenty of chance to establish an independent Palestinian state , but their intransigence ha prevented it . It seems the Palestinians aren & rsquo ; t interested in their own state alongside a Jewish state , they prefer a Palestinian state that take the place of the Jewish state.Palestinian inflexibility isn & rsquo ; t the only problem plaguing the two-state solution . Not only do Palestinians refuse to negotiate peace with Israel , but they also utilize terrorism a a method of obtaining their political objectives.Contrary to a narrative popularly pushed by Western leader and medium , Palestinian terrorism isn & rsquo ; t just conducted by the extremist in Palestinian society . Terrorism ha the support of Palestinian leadership and the people . Leaders incentivize terrorism through program like & ldquo ; pay for slay & rdquo ; ; teacher encourage violence by using example of terrorism in their classroom ; and society a a whole sends a clear message by naming street , school , and municipal building after terrorists.Palestinians expect the world to cater to their demand , reverse 75 year of history , and create a Palestinian state along the border the United Nations set in 1947 . They imagine they can refuse to negotiate for peace and move to terrorism and there won & rsquo ; t be any consequence to their position . Their assumption are irrational and unrealistic . The Palestinians have had multiple opportunity to create an independent state for themselves and have passed up on each and every opportunity for peace . Their rejectionism ha consequences.It is time the world addressed Palestinians honestly . Instead of talking about a two-state solution and a & ldquo ; revamped & rdquo ; Palestinian Authority , it & rsquo ; s time the world told Palestinians they have given up the chance of a state.Their adoration of death , violence , and terrorism ha defeated their aspiration for an independent state . They must give up their insistence on a state & ldquo ; From the river to the sea , & rdquo ; and even in part of it , and work towards a peaceful negotiated settlement with Israel . Further terrorism and intransigence will only make life worse for them , going forward.Until the world is ready to have this honest conversation with the Palestinians , they will continue to hold onto their unrealistic demand and increase their terrorism.The writer is a certified interfaith hospice chaplain in Jerusalem and the mayor of Mitzpe Yeriho , Israel .

2021-05-20 02:57:57.157,jpost,"The term & ldquo ; pogrom & rdquo ; is unfortunately back in our lexicon . & nbsp ; Last week , Israeli President Reuven Rivlin described attack by & ldquo ; a bloodthirsty Arab mob & rdquo ; in the mixed Jewish-Arab city of Lod a a & ldquo ; pogrom . & rdquo ; A Jewish vigilante in Lod told The Washington Post that he wa defending it Jewish resident & ldquo ; from a pogrom . & rdquo ; On the other side , when a video captured Jewish rioter beating what they took to be an Arab man in Bat Yam , a Pakistani writer tweeted , & ldquo ; This is what a pogrom look like . & rdquo ; So what exactly is a pogrom ? And are Jews the inevitable , exclusive victim ? It & rsquo ; s been over a century since the Russian word & ldquo ; pogrom & rdquo ; entered the English language , but the civil unrest in Israel is unfortunately bringing the term back into current usage . The New York Times , using the Yiddish plural & ldquo ; pogromen , & rdquo ; & nbsp ; first cited the term in 1882 to describe the wave of anti-Jewish violence that followed the assassination of Czar Alexander II , and provided a helpful inline definition : & ldquo ; riot against the Jews . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Slavic root of the term , derived from the evocative word & ldquo ; to thunder , & rdquo ; add tone but otherwise give little indication of it meaning . Pogrom wa one of many word , including & ldquo ; riot , & rdquo ; & ldquo ; upheaval & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; disorderly conduct , & rdquo ; used to describe the horrific attack that plagued Jewish village in the Russian Empire from 1881 to 1884 a transient Russian worker rode the rail from shtetl to shtetl , stopping at every station to beat , rape and occasionally murder . & nbsp ; In the wake of the violence , some 1.75 million Eastern European Jews migrated to the United States , the number tapering off only in the 1920s when restrictive immigration quota were imposed . The term pogrom migrated with them , from Russian to Yiddish to English . In the late 19th century , many Jewish activist believed that Alexander III , the new czar , had given his blessing to the pogrom by directing police to turn a blind eye to the violence . This view wa famously captured in Sholom Aleichem & rsquo ; s writing and in the musical & ldquo ; Fiddler on the Roof , & rdquo ; based on his story , when the local police chief let Tevye in on the secret plan for an upcoming pogrom . & nbsp ; Toward the end of the 20th century , archival research led historian to dismiss that interpretation of the pogrom . & nbsp ; The 1881-1884 pogrom were not organized by the bureaucratically inept Russian government , which viewed the uncontrollable violence a a threat to the stability of the regime a a whole . & nbsp ; By contrast , the far more brutal pogrom of the 20th century , including the notorious Kishinev pogrom of 1903 and the bloody pogrom that engulfed Ukraine during the chaos that followed World War I , showed much clearer sign of coordination by authority at various level . The last czar , Nicholas II , tacitly encouraged the violence by openly supporting the violent Black Hundreds organization and even underwriting the publication of the antisemitic work & ldquo ; The Protocols of the Elders of Zion . & rdquo ; The definition of the word pogrom thus ha come to include three essential element : a violent mob , Jewish victimhood and at least the appearance of some level of central planning or incitement , although the attack themselves seem more spontaneous . & nbsp ; Although the word pogrom first emerged in the late 19th century , it wa later applied anachronistically to incident in the distant past . Social upheaval directed against Jews are virtually a old a Jewish history itself , with the street violence of Alexandria , Egypt , in the year 38 C.E . considered the earliest example . & nbsp ; Throughout the medieval period , a combination of religious fervor and bloodlust motivated ordinary citizen to rise up and attack Jews in hundred of crusade , blood libel and false charge of host desecration , often with the tacit or explicit approval of ruling authority . & nbsp ; The term pogrom is rarely used to describe the event of the Holocaust , on quantitative and qualitative ground : The Nazis murdered million in a hierarchical , organized and bureaucratic manner unlike the erratic and spontaneous attack by pogromists . Nevertheless , certain specific incident from World War II might qualify , such a the notorious Petliura Days of Lviv or the massacre of the Jews of Jedwabne . Kristallnacht , the & ldquo ; night of broken glass & rdquo ; that presaged the genocide , is often described a a pogrom . The word may be borrowed for other purpose & mdash ; the authoritative Oxford English Dictionary relates a few citation & mdash ; but they often sound wrong , like dark example of cultural appropriation . Non-Jewish population often suffered very similar attack & mdash ; Mennonites were horribly brutalized by anarchist band in Ukraine , for example , and their woe compounded by deeply held pacifist belief that prevented self-defense & mdash ; but pogrom is deeply rooted in Jewish history and narrative , no less than & ldquo ; intifada & rdquo ; is rooted in the Palestinian narrative . Two of the classic element of the historical pogrom are sadly present in the street of some Israeli city , namely mob violence and Jewish victim . The appearance of central planning , however , is hard to identify , and the term doesn & rsquo ; t account for the fact that the government and law enforcement are predisposed to defend Israel & rsquo ; s Jewish citizen . Historically , pogrom are synonymous with Jewish powerlessness . Is it possible to speak of a pogrom when the state authority responsible for maintaining public order are Jewish ? & nbsp ; As for the use of the term pogrom by the pro-Palestinian side : Is that a fair label , with it ironic connotation that the former victim of pogrom have become it perpetrator ? Or a foul appropriation meant to erase Jewish history and & ldquo ; flip the script & rdquo ; ? & nbsp ; The debate is similar to the one over how to describe urban unrest in this country : Are they & ldquo ; race riot & rdquo ; ? & ldquo ; Rebellions & rdquo ; ? & ldquo ; Police riot & rdquo ; ? & ldquo ; Uprisings & rdquo ; ? & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Perhaps none of this discussion is helpful from a practical standpoint . When neighbor rise up and physically assault each other , especially after decade of peaceful coexistence , perhaps it doesn & rsquo ; t really matter what term we use to describe the violence . But the language we use shape our response to a crisis & mdash ; word matter . From the standpoint of history , naming the violence a pogrom , a riot or an intifada will have implication for how the State of Israel chooses to contain the threat .

We need to increase the military pressure on Hamas , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar said.He also argued that the destruction of Hamas & rsquo ; s ruling capability wa not proceeding a planned . & ldquo ; Hamas & rsquo ; s takeover of humanitarian aid meant for civilian strengthens it , and undermines the goal , & rdquo ; Sa & rsquo ; ar said.Threats to quit governmentSa & rsquo ; ar also repeated a statement from earlier this week , that if he is not given a seat in the war cabinet , his party will quit the government . Even if it doe , it will not call for an election , according to a clarification by Sa & rsquo ; ar & rsquo ; s spokesperson.A number of other party leader held their own press conference on Monday ahead of their party & rsquo ; weekly meetings.Opposition leader and Yesh Atid chairman MK Yair Lapid criticized what he claimed wa the coalition & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; disgraceful & rdquo ; attempt to wiggle it way out of a decision to draft haredi ( ultra-Orthodox ) men into the IDF to fill rank of casualty and meet Israel & rsquo ; s heightened security need . & ldquo ; The fact that they again are making up trick and finagles and delay is not just an affront to our soldier , it endangers the State of Israel , & rdquo ; Lapid said . The Supreme Court on Sunday gave the government a small extension to March 27 to deliver it response a to why it wa not drafting haredi men after the law that enabled the exemption expired last June . & ldquo ; If they care about security , they need to tell the haredi party : & lsquo ; Friends , there are no more game . You need to internalize that you are done getting without giving . Whoever doe not enlist will not receive even one worn-out agora [ a 100th of a shekel ] , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; Lapid added.Yisrael Beytenu head Avigdor Liberman said it wa no longer possible to talk about quota for haredi men to enlist in the IDF every year , and that it wa time for a law that every 18-year-old will serve for three year , after which & ldquo ; they will do whatever they want , & rdquo ; Liberman said.Talks between haredi party , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Defense Minister Yoav Gallant , and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have been ongoing over the past few week to find a way to solve the current haredi draft crisis.The crisis began after the government last month announced it plan to extend mandatory and reserve duty for current soldier , but without recruiting soldier from a broader pool of candidate , such a haredi , to lessen the burden on those who already are serving.The crisis also coincided with a court case against the haredi exemption that is currently underway in the Supreme Court . The previous law that enabled haredi exemption officially expired at the end of June 2023 , and the government decided that it would pas a new law by the end of March 2024.However , with that date nearing , the government doe not seem close to solving the issue , and it is likely to request other extension until the end of June . Government funding for yeshiva student also stem from the law that expired , and thus if no solution is found on time , haredi men may no longer be legally entitled to an exemption , and yeshivot may lose their funding.Israel Hayom reported on Monday evening that one of the possible solution wa to raise the age of exemption for haredi men from it current 26 to somewhere between 35 and 40 . This mean that haredi men who leave their yeshiva before that age would need to serve in the IDF.The idea is that this will allow whoever want to study full time to continue doing so , but on the other hand , it will disincentivize haredi who are not interested in studying from using their yeshiva student status a a cover to avoid IDF service . Haredi men who are yeshiva student can not legally work.Some minister , such a Smotrich , thought prior to October 7 that the age of exemption should be lowered to a low a 21 to enable haredi men to join the workforce earlier without having to do IDF service first . The new idea to do the opposite and actually increase the age of exemption would be a significant conceptual shift .",sa'ar hold first party meeting after break off from gantz

Bottom line , the authority wa taken from u , the court invalidated this law and arrangement multiple time , `` Halevi said at the beginning of his remarks.He then clarified his position on the matter , `` This doe not mean that I accept that people do not serve in the army . We must honestly say to the public , that not only should the ultra-Orthodox serve in the army , but but so should the Arabs , who for almost four generation have become accustomed to the obscene habit of not participating in the moral , civil , and Torah duty of serving in the IDF . That is why we need to change this a quickly a possible to bring actual result . `` According to Halevi , `` The proposal in the past were proposal that said ' let 's understand the ultra-Orthodox , and we will make process , but in the end , they will lead to a deeper integration into society .

This is our social , public matter and the Knesset should decide on this . The attorney-general overstepped here .

2023-11-17 17:55:58.697,jpost,"The recent announcement about the discovery of an explosive laboratory in the Shuafat refugee camp did not surprise resident of Pisgat Ze ’ ev . They are used to the sound of explosion and automatic weapon for year and have even become accustomed to collecting the bullet casing from the child ’ s trampolines.This is what neighborhood resident and journalist Uri Rodriguez Garcia wrote this week , with more than a hint of bitterness . However , starting on October 7 , what wa almost background noise that many have become used to ha turned into a real state of war.Crisis in Pisgat Ze'ev : Fears of Palestinian attack post-October 7Yael Entebi , a long-time resident and candidate for city council ( although municipal election have been temporarily postponed due to the war ) , said that the craziest thing about this situation is that it is not an area in the territory and not in Gaza – but here , in Jerusalem , the capital of Israel.Recently , parent of child who participate in sport class in a facility located next to the security fence asked authority to provide solution to the dangerous situation before a disaster occurs . Parents who attend evening class at the Teddy Kollek School , near the security fence , are demanding that armed guard be stationed there . So far , the municipality ha authorized increased patrol in the area , but that solution hasn ’ t calmed the parents.In fact , tension rose after dozen of Palestinians tried to cross the security fence and were stopped only after police were called . As a result , parent of the child who participate in the afternoon and evening class at the Teddy Kollek School say that their child ’ s safety is being neglected and are refusing to continue “ business a usual . ” “ There is no security and no lighting . It ’ s 200 meter from the seam line . It ’ s really scary , ” said one parent , adding that the school , about 200 m . from the Hizmeh checkpoint , is only a five-minute walk . “ The road from the parking lot to the sport hall is very dark , there is no lighting , and small child [ who go there ] are afraid to attend . ” As of this week , a security squad ha started to operate in Pisgat Ze ’ ev , a well a in 10 other neighborhood . “ That is very good , ” affirmed Antebi , “ but it is far from being enough . Our house are a few meter away from these Arab neighborhood built after the security fence wa erected . These are area rife with crime , the weapon there are in everyone ’ s hand , and they shoot indiscriminately . “ The Palestinians who moved there because of the affordable and new construction [ are now fleeing ] from there for their life and returning to live in the east of the city a much a possible . ” Antebi observed that the lack of security in the neighborhood ha been increasing , and did not start with October 7.In response to the community ’ s concern , the Jerusalem Municipality stated : “ Pisgat Ze ’ ev ’ s community administration hold class subject to the instruction of the Home Front Command , according to which holding an activity doe not require the posting of a guard or security . “ At the same time , the community administration team asked the Home Front Command soldier to conduct patrol in the afternoon and evening , with an emphasis on the sport hall and place where class are held . As for the lighting in the area , the issue will be examined and addressed . ” In the wake of riot and serious disturbance that have taken place recently a few hundred meter away from house on the perimeter of the community , near the security fence , the Jerusalem District Police announced last week that several security measure will be implemented in the neighborhood to ensure the security of the resident . These will include increased patrol around the security fence . Security force will also employ all existing mean to disperse disturbance , and will act against those who try to breach the security fence.PISGAT ZE ’ EV is a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem , adjacent to Neveh Ya ’ acov . It ha a mixed population of haredi , National Religious , and secular Jews . It is divided into five area : central , north , south , east , and west , and is one of the ring neighborhood around Jerusalem . As of May 2022 , approximately 45,100 resident live there ; it is one of the largest neighborhood in Jerusalem . Named after Zionist-Revisionist leader Ze ’ ev Jabotinsky , Pizgat Ze ’ ev wa established on territory beyond the Green Line that have been effectively annexed to Israel after the 1967 Six Day War.The main idea behind the establishment of the neighborhood wa to create a Jewish urban continuum between French Hill and the Neveh Ya ’ acov neighborhood , which until then had been cut off from Jerusalem in term of urban continuity . Land designated for the establishment of the neighborhood wa expropriated in early 1980 , after a long delay by the Finance Ministry , which feared the high cost compensating some Jews who owned land there in the 1930s . In fact , part of the neighborhood wa owned by Jews who perished in the Holocaust , and the heir of three of them were aware of the purchase and received compensation for it at the time . The remaining Jewish owner died without leaving heir , or their heir are unaware of their right to the land . The Ministerial Committee for Jerusalem Affairs made the official decision to establish the neighborhood on December 3 , 1980 , with the urban planning assigned to landscape architect Zvi Dekel . The construction of the neighborhood began in 1982 , and the first house were inhabited in 1985 . In 2007 , Arab family began moving into Pisgat Ze ’ ev , with estimate of 1,500 Arabs living there now . In 2009 , a group of rabbi called for a boycott of Jewish resident who were selling or renting apartment to Arabs ; however , the boycott did not occur . Since 2010 , ultra-Orthodox family began to settle there a a bridge to nearby Neveh Ya ’ acov . Many moved to Pisgat Ze ’ ev north and central Pisgat Ze ’ ev , which had a mix of National Religious and secular Jews from the outset . Pisgat Ze ’ ev east , Pisgat Ze ’ ev west , and Pisgat Ze ’ ev south are still mostly populated by National Religious and secular Jews , primarily young family . ❖",jerusalem resident decry lax security over fear of palestinian terror
2024-04-04 17:38:02.933,jpost,"National Unity chairman Benny Gantz & rsquo ; s call for a national election in September wa the first time he specified a time for it since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7 . He attributed his decision to the uptick in the intensity and volume of protest against the government over the past week . What Israel needed wa & ldquo ; quiet in the ballot box instead of flame in the street , & rdquo ; he said.This argument is diametrically opposed to that of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who warned in a press conference on Sunday night that an election would create divisiveness and play into the hand of Hamas . An election wa a bad idea when we are a & ldquo ; step away from victory , & rdquo ; he said.This wa somewhat contradictory to a comment made earlier in his speech , however , when he said a humanitarian and then military operation in Rafah would & ldquo ; take time & rdquo ; and that there wa & ldquo ; no victory without entering Rafah , & rdquo ; implying that victory wa not immediately at hand.Either way , ironically , an election could actually ease the way forward to ending the war in Gaza with a hostage deal and a governing alternative to Hamas.Formally , Israel head to an election either when the prime minister resigns or when the Knesset pass a bill to disperse itself . Once this happens , the government becomes a caretaker government and remains in power until the next government take over.Caretaker government are not supposed to make far-reaching decision . Still , they are not defined in law , and a number of significant move were indeed made under them , including former prime minister Yair Lapid & rsquo ; s maritime border agreement with Lebanon in 2022.As long a Netanyahu & rsquo ; s government relies on it far-right party , the Religious Zionist Party and Otzma Yehudit , he will be limited in the concession he is willing to make on a hostage deal and the future of Gaza . With the Knesset officially disbanded , however , the far-right party lose their leverage ; they can not threaten to bring down the government since it ha already fallen.This could pave the way for an ad-hoc coalition of at least some of the remaining Jewish party , including those currently in the opposition , to move forward . According to a National Unity Party spokesperson , Gantz & rsquo ; s call for an election & mdash ; along with several policy argument regarding a hostage deal , the security situation in the North , and the possibility of normalizing tie with Saudi Arabia & mdash ; wa intended to point to & ldquo ; where we are headed . & rdquo ; Netanyahu ha hesitated to state a clear policy on what the end of the war will look like . Still , he ha insisted time again that it three goal & ndash ; defeating Hamas , freeing the hostage , and ensuring that Gaza will never again be a security threat to Israel & ndash ; will be attained . If he concludes that these can not be achieved within a reasonable time due to the far-right party , disbanding the government may actually enable him to do so.Of course , this would be a political gamble , which Netanyahu is famous for avoiding . He would be ferociously attacked by the party to his right and would likely lose vote to those party . It also is not optimal from a democratic standpoint because government should not take advantage of their caretaker status to implement policy.But if the prime minister come to the realization that an election in the coming year is unavoidable , he may benefit from being the one to initiate it , portraying himself a the responsible adult who is attentive to public sentiment.The Likud , a it usually doe , attacked Gantz in response and accused him of engaging in & ldquo ; petty politics . & rdquo ; With Gantz making the first move , there may come a time in the coming month when Netanyahu realizes that Gantz ha a point and make a move himself .",why did benny gantz call for an election - and how will netanyahu respond ? - analysis

The investigator alleged that this proved that the soldier knowingly shot at a civilian to kill . & nbsp ; `` The evidence is overwhelming .

But when an individual state fails to protect it own citizen , it 's the responsibility of the international community to protect them instead.On July 4 , the bullet & mdash ; that killed Abu Akleh during a May 11 Israeli-Palestinian Jenin firefight & mdash ; wa tested by a third party and overseen by the US Security Coordinator . While the test wa inconclusive due to the damage to the projectile , the US State Department spokesman Ned Price released a statement saying that Israeli fire had likely killed the journalist.White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre assured on September 6 that there would be accountability for the death , but did n't specify what this entailed . The following day , brief controversy ensued in Israel when deputy State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said that the US would press Israel to review it policy , practice , and rule of engagement . & nbsp ; This wa dismissed by Israeli leader a detached from the reality of combat on the ground . At The Jerusalem Post Annual Conference in New York in mid-September , US Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides said that Israel can decide for itself regarding it rule of engagement . `` It 's obvious that Israeli war criminal can not investigate their own crime , `` said the Abu Akleh family on Tuesday . `` There must be consequence when a military kill civilian & mdash ; if not , it affords Israel 's military , and any other military , the impunity to do this once again . `` `` It 's obvious that Israeli war criminal can not investigate their own crime .

However , the military also dismissed the need for a criminal problem , since it would not have been a deliberate action . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; There is a high possibility that Shireen wa accidentally hit by IDF gunfire that wa fired toward suspect identified a armed Palestinian gunman , during an exchange of fire in which life-risking , widespread and indiscriminate shot were fired toward IDF soldier , & rdquo ; the IDF Spokesperson & rsquo ; s Unit said . `` Another possibility remains that Abu Akleh wa hit by bullet fired by Palestinian militant . `` The Abu Akleh family ha been highly critical of the US and Israel throughout the investigation process , and the claim that the IDF deliberately killed the journalist far predates Tuesday 's statement and the new Al Haq-Forensic Architecture investigation.Al-Haq is one of the six Palestinian NGOs designated by Israel a a front for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization . `` No other Palestinian , American or Journalist 's family should have to endure what ours ha , `` the family concluded in Tuesday 's statement . `` We 're pursuing accountability to make sure that is the case . ``",shireen abu akleh 's family submits complaint against israel to icc
2022-02-15 19:26:08.037,jpost,"A range of move by the government have led to the seizure of NIS 103 million of Hamas terrorism fund , National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel official Sagi Volkovitz said at a government conference on Tuesday . His agency is part of the Defense Ministry . Volkovitz gave complex example of group that would sell or deliver good to Hamas in Gaza to get around banking regulation , while a seemingly disconnected Hamas office in a foreign country would pay for something in return that regulator would be hard-pressed to make a connection with . The conference primarily highlighted the 20th anniversary and work of the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority ( IMPA ) headed by Shlomit Wagman , but it also featured official from other agency , including the police , the prosecution and the court . Wagman said the IMPA work with the police , the prosecution , tax agency , but also & ldquo ; with the Mossad , the Shin Bet [ Israel Security Agency ] and other agency in way that I can not specify , & rdquo ; to combat terrorist financing and money-laundering . She said the IMPA help intelligence agency and law enforcement to be able to arrive at declaring certain group a terrorist organization by helping them connect Israel & rsquo ; s adversary & rsquo ; complex scheme and financial dot . & ldquo ; Our joining the FATF [ Financial Action Task Force ] wa noted a a difficulty for Iran , & rsquo ; & rsquo ; a the Islamic Republic ha tried , and failed to date , to get it name off the FATF global agency economic blacklist , she said . The FATF is a global money-laundering and terrorism-financing watchdog . She praised the country & rsquo ; s new economic crime-focused court for their special expertise in money-laundering and terrorism-financing case so that the government can seize illegal fund faster , where sometimes & ldquo ; there are billion at stake . & rdquo ; Tel Aviv District Court Judge and head of the special Economic Crimes Courts Khaled Kabuv said the move to establish these specially focused court started around three year ago after he and other judge were exposed at various conference to the level of complexity in the field . After he repeatedly heard and wa shown that the special legal and factual expertise needed to handle terrorism-financing , money-laundering and legal dispute over new kind of digital currency wa far beyond the judge & rsquo ; current capacity , he helped push to establish court rooted in that expertise . He said that with specially trained judge , case that once could take more than a decade due to their complexity and the judge & rsquo ; s lack of familiarity with the intricate issue involved , now could be resolved in only two to three year . Kabuv said there were heated debate about establishing court and judge focused in these area , and also about whether there should be separate unit to deal with money-laundering and digital issue versus corporate and security legal dispute . In the end though , Kabuv said he helped convince key decision-makers that one economic-focused court unit wa the right way to go . He added that they had made a lot of progress and that in a few more year , the vision would be fully realized . Speaking by video , FATF president Dr . Marcus Pleyer said , & ldquo ; Money laundering pose a threat not only to our financial system , but also to the rule of law . & rdquo ; He emphasized the FATF & rsquo ; s new focus to combat the , & ldquo ; financing of extreme right-wing terrorism , & rdquo ; something that ha sometimes been overlooked in the past . Globally , he said there is $ 260 billion in illegal financial transaction taking place to facilitate the same violent criminal organization that distribute drug and cause other problems.Pleyer warned that & ldquo ; many country have not implemented law effectively , & rdquo ; even if they have solid law for combating illegal transaction on the book . He said more country will need to start looking underneath trust and other complex financial mechanism used to conceal the real owner of certain illegal fund , including learning more about foreign company . Justice Minister Gideon Sa & rsquo ; ar credited the IMPA with helping turn the tide in the battle to reduce internal violence within the Israeli-Arab sector . Also on Tuesday , the IMPA published a report noting that the volume of cyberattacks against Israel in 2021 had jumped seven time a compared to 2020 . The report highlighted the large number of ransomware attack where Iran wa the true sponsor once the IMPA pierced the veil of third party fronting the attack . Further , the report went into extensive detail to deconstruct pattern and criminal probe that helped identify Iranian involvement a the mastermind pulling the string . In term of the impact , the report said that 42 % of large Israeli business have experienced cyberattacks . Some 91 % of those harmed by cyberattacks never report the harm to the authority and around 80 % of those business that paid the ransomware demanded of them ended up facing repeat attack afterward .",israel seized ni 103 million hamas terror fund - counterterror financial official

2024-03-29 10:55:20.533,jpost,"Contrary to most report , Salim Joubran , who died on March 15 , wa not the first Israeli-Arab Supreme Court justice when he wa appointed in 2003.Technically , that distinction go to Abdel Rahman Zuabi , who received a temporary appointment a a Supreme Court justice in 1999.However , Zuabi served for only nine months.Joubran served from 2003 to 2017 and finished with the rank of deputy chief justice , a well a being the first Israeli-Arab to chair the Central Elections Commission.In that sense , he wa the father of the idea that a minimum of one seat should be an Israeli-Arab.Since then , his seat wa filled by two other Israeli-Arabs . First George Karra , for a short term ; and now by Khaled Kabub.In that regard , Joubran convinced the Jews of Israel that the court & rsquo ; s identity must somewhat reflect the country & rsquo ; s multi-religious nature , and convinced the Arabs of Israel that partnering with Israeli society can be worth it and have real results.Not everything wa perfect . There wa an incident in 2012 when Joubran came under attack by many in the political sphere when he stood for the singing of & ldquo ; Hatikvah & rdquo ; during a state ceremony , but he clearly did not sing the words.Ultimately , Joubran weathered the storm , with many mainstream political and judicial official pointing out that a long a he stood and conveyed respect , that neither he , nor Israeli-Arab soldier , could be expected to sing about Jewish longing to return to their homeland.Orthodox former deputy chief justice Elyakim Rubinstein wa one of those who publicly came to Joubran & rsquo ; s defense at the time , and he eulogized Joubran last week a one of his close friend in the court.Most of the time , though , Joubran managed to stay out of and above politics.He represented Israel around the world and served a one of it brightest light in embodying Israeli multicultural coexistence.Whenever critic tried to tear Israel down a discriminating against Arabs , the example of Joubran could be rolled out a a stark contrast to that narrative.Joubran wa involved in a myriad of historic decisions.He wa on the panel of three justice who rejected the appeal of former president Moshe Katsav , sending him to prison for seven year for rape and sexual abuse.Likewise , he wa on the bench of five justice who rejected part of the appeal of former prime minister Ehud Olmert , sending him to jail for two plus year on various charge of public corruption.Ever the independent thinker , Joubran wa the one dissenting vote on the Olmert panel when four justice tossed out the largest conviction for Olmert having allegedly requested that a middle man give NIS 500,000 to the former prime minister & rsquo ; s brother , Yossi Olmert . Had they listened to Joubran , Olmert would have spent many more year in prison.Regarding equality issue , he wa a consistent and unabashedly liberal voice whether for Jews or for Arabs . He wrote soaring opinion about justice and fairness that even his conservative critic sometimes respected more than they respected quieter closet activist , who often ruled liberally but tried to frame themselves in technical non-activist terms.In his final case & ndash ; a 2017 ruling on same-sex couple & rsquo ; surrogacy right & ndash ; Joubran said that he found it difficult to come to term with a situation in which single people and same-sex couple were blocked from fulfilling their dream to become parent through surrogacy agreements.He said he could not see the justice of giving preference to heterosexual parent over same-sex parent , though the court a a whole deferred the issue for six month to give the Knesset time to resolve legislation on the issue which it wa already considering.In addition , Joubran advocated religious freedom and pluralism for Jews , often banging head with the haredi rabbinic establishment.Regarding Israeli-Arab equality , he dissented in a major 2014 razor-thin 5-4 Supreme Court decision which kept a law in place that allowed & ldquo ; acceptance committee & rdquo ; to vet and reject candidate using vague criterion for around 434 yishuvim ( village ) in the Negev and the Galilee.That law replaced an earlier law previously struck down by the Supreme Court which explicitly permitted discrimination against Israeli-Arabs in those villages.However , Joubran and three other dissenting justice said that the new law would be used to achieve the same outcome and impact a the old law of discriminating against Israeli-Arabs , and possibly sometimes against haredi or other minority group . This wa even if , at face value , the new law did not explicitly discriminate.The new brand of moderate-formalist activist allied with a growing group of conservative to keep the law , but unapologetic liberal like Joubran could not stand a law which would likely cause inequality , even if there were technical reason to avoid or delay striking the law until it played out more in the real world.In 2016 , in the High Court & rsquo ; s 4-1 decision , Joubran got to vote in the majority against justice Noam Sohlberg , invalidating a 10-year price freeze and cap on legal liability rule that wa part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s natural gas policy.Joubran also voted 3-2 in the majority against Sohlberg and then-justice Esther Hayut to suspend the policy for a year while the government would adjust the price and liability issues.But in that same series of ruling , the Supreme Court affirmed virtually all of the many other aspect of the policy by a 4-1 majority , with only Joubran dissenting.This included empowering Netanyahu to override and circumvent objection of the antitrust authority on the ground of national security.This wa huge.The prime minister , acting a his own economy minister , could override the antitrust authority on a question of economics using national security a a reason.Joubran had no problem switching back to being in the minority on that issue to check what he regarded a executive power overreach.Critics would say that Joubran harmed the country & rsquo ; s economic development and imposed his own world view in place of the representative of the voter , Netanyahu.But Joubran viewed the court a the last line of defense of those in society who were weaker ; and if that meant protecting the antitrust authority in a way that slowed down economic development , he wa at peace with that . Unlike other liberal justice , he wa willing to say it out loud.I met Joubran a number of time at conference and Supreme Court ceremony , and I saw him in action countless time on the bench.There were some on the bench who struck me a having been promoted up through the rank but basically remaining the same a they had always been , simply at a higher rung within the judiciary.Joubran seemed to hold himself differently and think in term of his place and the court & rsquo ; s place in history , and trying to find the right side of history to be on without getting dragged down into the technicality of the moment.Once again , conservative would not like many of his ruling but would honor his honesty and the sense that he wa a true believer and not just playing the politics of his sector of society.I also found him to be kind and a gentleman , with a lightness in an old-fashioned way that is hard to capture in the social medium punchy age of 2024.A graduate of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Joubran practiced private law from 1970 until 1982 before leaving to accept an appointment to the Haifa Magistrate & rsquo ; s Court . In 1993 , he wa appointed to the Haifa District Court , and wa then promoted to the Supreme Court in 2003.At his retirement , he preached stronger commitment to coexistence and to integration of Israel & rsquo ; s Arab minority.In an age of unbridled partisanship and personal ambition , Joubran & rsquo ; s voice of being respectful , honest , and genuinely committed to the State of Israel , though his background could have given him every excuse to take an opposite path , will be missed .",meet former deputy chief justice salim joubran : the embodiment of coexistence

2024-04-09 17:36:13.903,jpost,"National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir 's announcement on Monday regarding his choice of Israel & rsquo ; s next police chief , Avshalom Peled , served not just a a general announcement , but also a a warning to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he could act to topple the government if Israel agrees to concession in a hostage deal that Ben-Gvir opposes.Ben-Gvir 's announcement wa not brought for approval to minister Benny Gantz 's National Unity party , which responded on Monday evening that it expected Netanyahu to respect a coalition agreement giving it veto power over major appointments.The fact that Ben-Gvir made the announcement without taking Gantz into account plant the excuse to leave the government if Gantz applies his veto . This connects directly to a threat from Ben-Gvir earlier on Monday , in a post on X , that if Netanyahu end Israel 's war against Hamas without an extensive attack on Hamas in Rafah , he will & ldquo ; cease to have a mandate to serve a prime minister . & rdquo ; In other word , the timing of the police chief appointment wasn & rsquo ; t a coincidence , but a reminder of Ben-Gvir & rsquo ; s leverage over Netanyahu . In order to dissolve the 120-member Knesset and force an election , 61 MKs must support it dissolution . The departure of Ben-Gvir & rsquo ; s six seat in itself is not enough to bring down the 72 seat governing coalition , but it will give Gantz the power to bring down the government in the near future by leaving with his eight seats.Ben-Gvir is hovering around the 10-seat mark in most poll , and he thus stand to gain from an election . But in order not to receive blame for the rise of a possible centrist government , he need to be able to explain to his voter why he decided to leave . Inaction on Rafah coupled with an inability to move forward with his choice of commissioner would serve a an adequate reason.Unilaterally announcing Peled a his choice for police chief may be a relatively empty threat , a it first must receive the approval of Israel & rsquo ; s Advisory Committee on Senior Civil Service Appointments . This committee usually approves the candidate brought before it , but in Peled & rsquo ; s case , it may not.Peled engaged in illegal quid-pro-quoThe Police Investigations Department recommended in 2015 that he not be promoted after a recording revealed that he engaged in a seemingly illegal quid-pro-quo with a local authority leader . Peled wasn & rsquo ; t indicted after the recording wa disqualified a evidence due to privacy-related infraction . Then-police chief Roni Alsheich ignored the recommendation and promoted Peled , but the advisory committee may not.Still , Ben-Gvir & rsquo ; s announcement and National Unity & rsquo ; s subsequent response that it expected Netanyahu to respect it veto power , if it chooses to use it , upped the pressure on the prime minister to appease Ben-Gvir by other mean to keep the national security minister on board.The move wa typical of Ben-Gvir , who , on a number of occasion , ha threatened to leave the government unless he receives certain concession . For example , Ben-Gvir threatened to jump ship when Netanyahu wa about to announce a freeze on the judicial reform just over a year ago , following mass protest and strike . Netanyahu convinced him to stay despite the freeze by agreeing to a government decision to begin the process of forming a National Guard , which wa a major policy goal for Ben-Gvir.This time around , Ben-Gvir may condition remaining in the government after a hostage deal on a commitment from Netanyahu to push through Peled & rsquo ; s appointment regardless of the National Unity veto . If Peled & rsquo ; s candidacy is struck down , Ben-Gvir will likely demand something else.For most of 2023 , Ben-Gvir wa considered a loose cannon and the largest potential threat to Netanyahu & rsquo ; s government . But with haredi party taking over in recent month a the major political threat due to the issue of haredi national service , Ben-Gvir made his presence felt and reminded the prime minister that he must be taken into account a well . & nbsp ;",ben-gvir 's police chief announcement is a veiled political threat - analysis

Thirty-year , ten-year , and five-year bond were sold in the issuing.The bond offering result showed that Israel would pay 135 basis point over comparable 5-year US Treasuries , 145 basis point over 10-year Treasuries , and 175 basis point over US 30-year bond . This mean that Israel will pay higher interest rate than comparable US bond issued over a similar time frame.Smotrich and Rothenberg celebrate change in bond salesRothenberg and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich celebrated the record-breaking debt issuance , pointing to the high demand a an important expression of foreign investor & rsquo ; faith in Israeli market .

Even in his state of mourning , the Bedouin ritual of hospitality is paramount . & nbsp ; Just two week ago , on the first day of the war , he and his brother were sitting in a similar shig with their child , on this little hilltop 4.5 km . north of the Bedouin town of Kuseife , some 65 km . from Gaza , when suddenly they heard a missile fly overhead and land in their animal pen . One of the brother went out to check on the penned animal , while another went to check on the camel . Saed wa just coming into the shig with the coffee finjan in his hand when a second missile landed in front of him , on the tin shig where the child were sitting . The flimsy shig wa flattened a if it were literally a tin-can , burying the five boy underneath the rubble . & nbsp ; It took the brother 15 minute to dig them out with their bare hand & ndash ; they didn & rsquo ; t have any tool to use & ndash ; and another 20 minute to get them to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba . Four of the boy & ndash ; brother Malek al-Qaran , 14 , and Jawad al-Qaran , 15 , and cousin Amin Akal al-Qaran , 16 , and Mohammad D & rsquo ; ib al-Qaran , 12 & ndash ; were already dead by the time they got there . Another cousin , Taleb Mahmoud al-Qaran , 35 , wa seriously wounded but survived and is being treated in a hospital in the center of the country.Ibrahim , the father of two of the boy killed in the missile attack , walk in silently , his head wrapped loosely with a scarf . There is nothing to say , and the two men sit silently a one , and then another cousin come to sit on the rug , and Saed serf them coffee.The corrugated tin panel that used to make up the shig where the boy died lie flat in a pile next to a new shig which ha been quickly built to replace it . & nbsp ; Here , in this isolated place in the desert , their little village is one of some 35 unrecognized Bedouin village dotting the Negev desert . Despite numerous request to the government from the resident , they have no air raid siren , nor are they allowed to build a safe room or communal bomb shelter , so the boy had no chance . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We have everything we need here , & rdquo ; Saed , who served in the IDF , said . & ldquo ; We just need bomb shelter . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; So far , no temporary bomb shelter have been set up for the unrecognized village , although at the entrance of the village the Islamic Movement brought two large cement pipe and placed cement slab on either side & ndash ; a if that would protect anyone . According to Saed , the Dead Sea Works potash plant put together a & ldquo ; shelter & rdquo ; with huge industrialized-size bag of dirt but no roof covering . Neither shelter affords protection worth the effort of trying to reach it during a rocket attack.Some 400,000 Bedouin live in Israel in an area ranging from Beersheba to Arad . This includes 100,000 in the 35 unrecognized village , such a al-Bat , which have no electricity , running water , paved road , or school infrastructure ; and 300,000 in seven established town . Thus the Negev Bedouin represent the most vulnerable socioeconomic group in Israel . & nbsp ; According to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel , at one point there were 46 unrecognized Bedouin village . Following the state & rsquo ; s recognition of 11 of them , 35 village in the Negev still remain unrecognized , with some still in the same location since before the creation of the State of Israel , and others in their current location following Israel & rsquo ; s transfer of the resident there during the period of military rule . & nbsp ; Since the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7 , at least 26 Bedouin citizen of Israel have been killed & ndash ; 19 by Hamas terrorist in the kibbutz where they were working early on that Saturday morning , and seven by Hamas missile . Osama Abu Asa , a Bedouin guard at the Supernova concert , wa killed a he attempted to protect some of the young people hiding in a bomb shelter , believing that Hamas would not kill him because he wa a Muslim . Abed Alrahman Ataf Alzeadna , 26 , from Rahat , wa among those killed by Hamas terrorist on Zikim Beach ; and four of his relative , who were with him , are still missingTaken hostageSix Bedouin who were working in the Holit dairy were kidnapped , including four member of the Ziadna family : father Yosef , 53 ; son Hamza , 22 , and Belal , 19 ; and daughter Aisha , 17 . & nbsp ; In addition , said Jamal Al-Kirnawi , a Bedouin social worker and director of New Dawn & ndash ; a Rahat-based Bedouin-Jewish coexistence NGO that provides programming for at-risk Bedouin youth & ndash ; several Bedouin soldier have been taken hostage , although how many ha not been made official . & nbsp ; If the attack had taken place on Sunday , there would have been many more Bedouin victim , a many are agriculture worker at the kibbutz , he added . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Bedouins are really suffering , & rdquo ; Al-Kirnawi , 44 , said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We were all shocked by what happened on October 7 . No one knew what wa going on . We thought it wa rocket attack like we are used to , and that soon there would be an army response . We were not expecting anything like this . The society ha been in shock & ndash ; especially the Bedouin who worked in the kibbutz . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We feel very sorry for this loss and pain . The rocket and Hamas did not differentiate between Jews and Bedouin . & rdquo ; He lost 20 close Jewish friend from the kibbutz in the terrorist attack and said he is still living in mourning , a he ha spent the week since the attack going from funeral to funeral and shiva to shiva . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; If on a daily basis we a Bedouins live in a complex reality , imagine the reality of uncertain chaos that we are living in now , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The war make it much worse in the complexity of the society & ndash ; how to handle this tragic crisis . No one is able to understand this biggest tragedy that ha happened . We feel the suffering of the family , and we can & rsquo ; t contain all the story of loss . We are not in a normal situation and are processing this loss . & rdquo ; The economy of Bedouin town ha shut down since October 7 , and the many Bedouins who worked in the kibbutz have lost their employment . But for Al-Kirnawi , the most difficult thing is that a a traditional society , many people in his community are suffering from anxiety and trauma ; but , in addition to municipal social welfare service being shut down and the government in general not functioning , the whole concept of counseling is still not widely accepted in Bedouin society , especially in the more traditional sector . & ldquo ; People are suffering , whether they speak about it or not , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; But in general , Bedouin society take what is happening on the outside and keep it inside , without interpreting how that affect them [ on the inside ] . & rdquo ; He added : & ldquo ; The concept of therapy is very hard , and usually people come to therapy when they are overwhelmed . So we need to be proactive before people get so overwhelmed that they need major intervention . & rdquo ; Trauma training for Bedouin mental health workersNew Dawn ha begun special trauma training for educator and mental health worker within the Bedouin community , who pay several visit to the family directly affected by the war reaching out with mental health tool to help them cope with the loss , trauma , and anxiety they are feeling , he said . & nbsp ; Initially , they have trained seven men and woman who have gone to attend to the most vulnerable in five village , and there are plan for further training session . & ldquo ; We can & rsquo ; t wait for [ government office ] . We , a a civil society , are much more powerful [ than the government ] , & rdquo ; he said.Manar Abu Gosh , 25 , a resident of Rahat and social worker and volunteer at New Dawn who ha gone through the training , ha begun visiting resident of the unrecognized village . The child are scared , and many of the parent are in shock and not able to function normally , she said . A missile fell near one of the village while she wa there , she noted . & ldquo ; We heard the sound of the missile , but we didn & rsquo ; t know where to run . The child were terrified , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; They are in a panic . & rdquo ; The men , who worked largely in agriculture , are now unemployed , and the child can & rsquo ; t participate in the remote video class because they have no Internet service nor tablet , Abu Gosh said . & ldquo ; They are , after all , citizen who want to live in peace and quiet , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The men do not want to talk about how they are feeling , but the woman and child come and speak about their worry and fear . Honestly , I came home and cried . It wa the first time I wa ever in an unrecognized village . I wa shocked by what is happening to them . They are in a terrible situation . But I will continue to go to speak with them . It is not easy for any of u . & rdquo ; President Isaac Herzog visited the Bedouin Situation Room in Rahat on October 26 , where Jewish and Arab Israelis are working together to provide care package for the most needy of the area & rsquo ; s resident , and met with community leader and family of the missing and murdered of the community , including representative of the Ziadna family . & ldquo ; We will continue to live together , and it is important for me to tell the entire Arab society in Israel how much I appreciate the responsibility shown across the community in these difficult day , & rdquo ; he told them on October 26 . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We deeply share in their grief . I came to offer my sympathy to the family , and we will meet with them again . We came to offer strength to the local authority and to hear what is important to them . We came to tell everyone : We will continue to live together and continue to live in peace . & ldquo ; What we saw on October 7 doe not represent Islam . Islam is a religion of respect , sensitivity , brotherhood , and love . & rdquo ; Quiet vigil for four family membersA few day before the president & rsquo ; s visit , in the Ziadna neighborhood of Rahat & ndash ; a conglomeration of tin hut and small garden outside of Rahat & ndash ; the uncle , brother , and nephew of Yosef Ziadna , kidnapped along with his three child , sit on white plastic chair in a large circle in a vigil outside a home . The young men all sport beard and are powerfully built , but in their eye are broken spirit , waiting to hear about their loved one . At the time of the visit , all four & ndash ; including daughter Aisha , who wear the traditional Muslim hijab & ndash ; were presumed to be held hostage in Gaza.Yosef & rsquo ; s brother Salem had also been at the Holit dairy on October 7 with his four young child a every Saturday , taking the youngster on a & ldquo ; fun day & rdquo ; to see the cow . He describes how for 12 harrowing hour he evaded the terrorist by hiding and darting through the dairy with his four terrified child , carrying the two the littlest one in his arm . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I heard shooting all the time . My child were so scared , they kept very quiet . Twice they captured u but I wa able to escape , but sadly Yosef and his child were captured , & rdquo ; he said . Though an uncle is hesitant about speaking to the press , Salem said he want the story of his escape to be published in a many medium outlet a possible , in the rare possibility that perhaps Yosef or his child will see it and then know that he and his child are safe . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; He is probably worried about u , too . I want to let him know that we are safe and got out . & rdquo ; Bedouin rescuer save 70 at SupernovaOn that Black Saturday morning , a reveler from the Supernova dance festival were frantically trying to escape from the onslaught of the Hamas attack , Hamed Alkarnawi and his family member Rafi , Ismail , and Dahish & ndash ; all of Rahat & ndash ; rushed to the scene with their truck when their cousin Hisham , who worked in the dining room of Kibbutz Be & rsquo ; eri , called them to tell them he and kibbutz member Aya Meidan & ndash ; who had gone out for a bike ride in the early morning & ndash ; were surrounded by Hamas terrorist . & nbsp ; The rescuer have declined medium interview , but in a powerful video produced by Have You Seen the Horizon Lately ? & ndash ; an initiative promoting Jewish-Arab partnership & ndash ; Meidan and the Alkarnawis recounted the daring rescue they undertook . Under fire , they first rescued some 40 young people from the Supernova party whom they encountered on their way to Be & rsquo ; eri hiding from the Hamas terrorist , and then made their way to rescue Hisham and Aya.Minivan driver Yosef El Zaidneh , 47 , also of the unrecognized neighborhood of Ziadna , who risked his life to save people from the party , ha become an unlikely medium hero after one of the people he rescued praised him and posted his phone number on social medium to bring him more costumer . & nbsp ; El Zaidneh described himself a a & ldquo ; regular person , & rdquo ; who never served in the army , just someone who go out every morning to work and come home in the evening to his wife and children.That Saturday at 1 a.m . , he took a regular customer and eight friend from Omer to the Supernova dance party near Kibbutz Re & rsquo ; im with instruction to return to pick them up later , at 1 p.m . But shortly after 6 a.m . , his phone began to ring incessantly and when his customer , Amit , told him there wa a red alert of missile , he told him he would be there in 20 minute . But a he approached the junction to Kibbutz Sa & rsquo ; ad , he saw car coming toward him and people motioning him to go back . & ldquo ; It is the first time in my life I have been afraid , & rdquo ; he said , but he continued through the gunfire and wa able to rescue 30 young Israelis a he packed twice the number of passenger allowed into his minivan . He knew the terrain near the kibbutz well and made his way through the field to safety , forging a way for other car to follow him . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; There wa not one soldier there ; I saw wounded police . I knew if we went on the road to Re & rsquo ; im , they would kill u . & rdquo ; When they eventually reached a roadblock manned by Israeli police , they were directed to Kibbutz Tze & rsquo ; elim . Sadly , his cousin , Abed al-Rahman Alnasarah , 50 , also a minivan driver , wa killed by the terrorist a he attempted to reach the party to rescue Israelis there.Since that morning El Zaidneh , the father of seven child , ha not been able to sleep , and the horrific scene of death and destruction keep replaying in his head . & nbsp ; He spends the night chain smoking and drinking coffee , sitting outside on the swing in his fenced-in yard in front of his corrugated tin hut , praying for the morning to come . He saw thing people should never have to see , he said . He ha received threatening phone call originating in Gaza from people claiming to be from Hamas who say they will find him because he rescued Israelis . He ha reported the call to the police , and his phone is under surveillance for any more threatening call that come in , he said . He ha been going to daily therapy session to help deal with the trauma . & nbsp ; El Zaidneh ha also received many phone call from people who want to donate money to him or give him present , he said , but he is not interested in any of that and often doe not even answer his phone anymore unless he recognizes the number . He did not do what he did for any sort of recognition , he said . & ldquo ; I had the chance to turn around . But above all , I am a human being , and I am an Israeli and I knew there were Israeli citizen [ in danger ] . If I can help , why not ? That is how our parent raised u . To do good if we can , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; I hope after this , the mayor of Omer & ndash ; who doe not like u & ndash ; and the State of Israel will appreciate the Bedouin and stop destroying our house and see that we are a part of this country . & ldquo ; We are not Hamas . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I hope that the country will now think about u ; help the Bedouin develop in education , in culture . Maybe we won & rsquo ; t be 100 % equal , but at least 70 % equal . & rdquo ;  Video of the Supernova rescue : x.com/Horizon_lately/status/1720905755371405633 ? t=KCzVUClfm7Y2_bsM2V13rA & amp ; s=08","after hamas 's massacre , israel 's bedouin share their silent trauma"
2024-03-29 15:21:57.043,jpost,"Israel will forever be grateful to US President Joe Biden for the support that he showed the battered country in the day immediately following the October 7 massacre.Israel will forever be grateful for the way he stood by the country in it darkest hour , how he warned Iran and it proxy Hezbollah not to take advantage of the situation and fully open other front against Israel , and how he sent US aircraft carrier strike force to the region to back up those warning . And , indeed , Iran and Hezbollah were deterred.Israel will forever be grateful for the way Biden immediately launched an arm airlift to the country , making good on his promise to ensure that Israel ha the wherewithal to defend itself.The country will also long remember the way he came here 11 day after Hamas & rsquo ; s attack , the first US president to visit Israel in time of war , and relieved the country & rsquo ; s stunning feeling of isolation by demonstrating genuine sympathy and empathy.Many , frankly , were surprised by the Democratic president & rsquo ; s unequivocal , unstinting support . In the day and week immediately following October 7 , Biden did the right thing by Israel.Hamas welcomed the resolution that the US allowed to passOn Monday , by instructing the US not to veto Security Council Resolution 2728 calling for an immediate ceasefire for Ramadan that will lead to a & ldquo ; lasting sustainable & rdquo ; ceasefire but not making that contingent on the Security Council & rsquo ; s call in the same resolution for Hamas & ndash ; which it ha yet to condemn for October 7 & ndash ; to release all the hostage , he did the wrong thing by Israel.It did not take long for the consequence of this action to be felt.Just hour after Hamas welcomed the resolution ( imagine the UN Security Council passing a resolution that ISIS or al-Qaeda , Hamas & rsquo ; s twin , would welcome ) , the terrorist organization turned down the term painstakingly hammered out in week of negotiation for a ceasefire and hostage release deal.The refusal of the Security Council to even once & ndash ; either through a resolution or in a statement put out by it president & ndash ; condemn Hamas for it October 7 atrocity is staggering . Especially considering that the council know how to condemn terrorism when Israel is not on the receiving end.For example , on March 22 , one day after a terrorist attack in Moscow killed some 140 people , the council issued a statement condemning & ldquo ; in the strongest term the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack . & rdquo ; The council swiftly issued a similar statement on Wednesday , within 24 hour of when a suicide bomber in Pakistan killed five Chinese worker and their Pakistani driver.Yet it & rsquo ; s now 174 day since terrorist murdered 1,200 people in Israel , kidnapped more than 240 hostage , raped woman , burned baby , mutilated body , set fire to entire community , and no similar statement from the Security Council ha yet been issued.And some still wonder why Israelis are cynical of world opinion and not particularly moved by Security Council actions.It is clear why Hamas rejected the hostage dealJust a it wa clear why Hamas would welcome Monday & rsquo ; s Security Council resolution , it is also equally clear why it rejected the hostage deal on the table.Hamas welcomed the resolution despite it call for an immediate release of all the hostage , because it know that the world will focus on the first part of the first clause in the nonbinding resolution & ndash ; pressing Israel hard to stop the fighting & ndash ; and pay less attention to the second part of that same clause : a call for Hamas to release all the hostages.Why will the world not press the second part of that clause ? Because it know full well that Hamas operates way outside the bound of civil society and that the terrorist organization is not going to heed any such call.It wa also clear following the resolution that Hamas would stiffen it condition on a hostage deal , sensing that if it just hold out longer , international pressure will force Israel to stop the war , enabling the terrorist group to survive to fight & ndash ; meaning to murder , rape , and mutilate & ndash ; another day . Security Council Resolution 2728 undoubtedly strengthened Hamas & rsquo ; s feeling that the international community would & ldquo ; deliver & rdquo ; Israel.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s office put out a statement saying a much on Tuesday . & ldquo ; Hamas & rsquo ; s stance clearly demonstrates it utter disinterest in a negotiated deal and attests to the damage done by the UN Security Council & rsquo ; s resolution . & rdquo ; While there is a tendency among many pundit and most opposition politician to reject anything Netanyahu say and to reflexively place the blame on Netanyahu rather than Biden whenever the two are at odds , in this case , that reflex is misplaced.Put aside whether , a a result of the US failure to veto the resolution , it wa wise for Netanyahu to cancel Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and National Security Council head Tzachi Hanegbi & rsquo ; s trip to Washington this week to consult on how to pursue the war in Rafah ( it wasn & rsquo ; t ) , and whether move such a these have political motivation ( they do ) . Nevertheless , Netanyahu is not always to blame in these confrontation with America , nor is Biden always free of fault.Do n't assume that another PM would have better relation with the USOn Tuesday , one leading columnist wrote in Yediot Aharonot : & ldquo ; Do we need anything more than what is happening in our relation with America to understand the abyss the prime minister is leading u into ? What else need to happen to understand that every additional day he sits in his chair , our international situation deteriorates , and the crisis with our biggest and only friend & ndash ; our arm supplier & ndash ; get worse ? & rdquo ; The columnist assumes that were someone else sitting in the prime minister & rsquo ; s chair right now , with the war in Gaza in it sixth month and picture of Palestinians suffering flooding the traditional and social medium in the West , Israel & rsquo ; s situation in the world would be any better.But that is an erroneous assumption.Had even Yesh Atid & rsquo ; s Yair Lapid been prime minister when October 7 happened , it is hard to believe that the country & rsquo ; s policy toward Hamas and the IDF & rsquo ; s way of prosecuting the war would be that significantly different from what they are now . While perhaps there would be more of an emphasis on the & ldquo ; day after & rdquo ; and a more receptive ear to international plea for more humanitarian aid into Gaza , Israel would have the same war aim it ha now of destroying Hamas & rsquo ; s capabilities.That aim & ndash ; unfortunately , because of the way Hamas ha chosen to fight & ndash ; will lead to a high number of Palestinian civilian casualty and much Palestinian suffering , regardless of who is sitting in the Prime Minister & rsquo ; s Office . And it is those casualty and that suffering that , more than anything , are driving the wedge between Jerusalem and Washington.If you doubt this , look back to the day of the Naftali Bennett and Lapid tag-team government and think whether Israel & rsquo ; s position among the progressive Democrats in the US wa that much better than it is under Netanyahu . It wasn & rsquo ; t , because the anti-Israel progressive and & ldquo ; social justice activist & rdquo ; who are all impacting Biden & rsquo ; s policy right now during an election year are opposed not only to Netanyahu but to Israel itself , regardless of who lead the country.In their mind , Israel is an instrument of white supremacy and imperialism , and regardless of the identity of the prime minister or composition of his government , the Jewish state would still be an illegitimate , racist , colonialist enterprise in their eyes.US official were quoted a saying that Netanyahu & rsquo ; s decision not to send Dermer and Hanegbi to Washington for consultation wa motivated by political consideration . And they are probably right . Being seen a willing to stand up to US pressure play well politically with Netanyahu & rsquo ; s base.But there is something disingenuous in this criticism of Netanyahu for letting political consideration influence his policy . Are not political consideration now also heavily influencing Biden & rsquo ; s policy in this crisis ? Last month , the US vetoed a similar resolution at the Security Council calling for an immediate ceasefire . Why did it not do the same thing now ? What changed in the interim ? Several thing changed . Among them is that the casualty figure in Gaza continue to rise , and another is that Biden is getting pounded by progressive Democrats and Arab Americans for his support of Israel.Biden & rsquo ; s tone and the tone of his administration have changed markedly in the last two month , and that ha to do with Arab Americans voting & ndash ; or not voting & ndash ; in Michigan and with progressive unenthused by the Biden campaign , harshly critical of his Israel policy , and threatening either to vote for a third party candidate or stay at home on Election Day , November 5.Both Biden and Netanyahu are political animal , and both are using their disagreement for their own political purpose . But to say this is all Netanyahu & rsquo ; s fault , and that Israel & rsquo ; s position in the world and in Washington would be sterling even amid a war such a this if someone else were calling the shot in Jerusalem , is unrealistic.This doesn & rsquo ; t mean that Netanyahu & rsquo ; s handling of the relationship with the US during the war ha been flawless . It most definitely ha not.For example , Netanyahu could have played Monday & rsquo ; s Security Council resolution completely differently & ndash ; accept a two-week ceasefire for the duration of Ramadan to win favor with the Biden administration and the world , and then resume fighting at the end of the Muslim holy month if Hamas did not release the hostage . At that point , Israel could say that it fulfilled the resolution , but Hamas did not & ndash ; placing the onus on the terrorist organization.Netanyahu could have done thing differently , but not all the tension in the relationship can be dumped on his doorstep . Netanyahu & ndash ; with all his fault & ndash ; is not always wrong , nor is Biden & ndash ; with all the support he ha given Israel since October 7 & ndash ; always right , a various opposition leader and leading voice in the medium lamenting the current tension in the relationship would have one believe.Monday & rsquo ; s Security Council resolution is a case in point .",us-israel tension are n't all netanyahu 's fault - analysis
2021-05-09 17:32:23.457,jpost,"The tension and clash in Jerusalem , particularly the video from Friday night showing Israeli police in al-Aqsa Mosque , have led to the first condemnation of Israel from the country & rsquo ; s new Gulf partner . & nbsp ; Bahrain condemned Israeli force for the & ldquo ; attack on worshiper at al-Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; The UAE ha called on Israel to de-escalate tension in Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah . & nbsp ; Bahrain also ha been concerned about the eviction of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah . It doesn & rsquo ; t want the peace process or stability in the region undermined , and it want provocation to stop . It want tension reduced a Ramadan concludes after a difficult month of clash . & nbsp ; The statement came a Saudi Arabia said it & ldquo ; reject Israel & rsquo ; s plan and measure to evict dozen of Palestinians from their home in Jerusalem and impose Israeli sovereignty over them . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The triumvirate of Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and the UAE is important because it is largely accepted that Riyadh gave the green light to Manama and Abu Dhabi to make peace last year . The Emirates went first , for various reason , even though Bahrain had long considered a peace deal and wa pushing coexistence for year . & nbsp ; The UAE made the first unprecedented flight with humanitarian aid during COVID-19 in the spring of 2020 . Then it ambassador to Washington , Yousef al-Otaiba , wrote an op-ed in Yediot Aharonot . Peace followed soon after a Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed down from & ldquo ; annexation & rdquo ; of the West Bank . & nbsp ; However , the peace deal , which moved quickly in August and September , hit some hurdle . There were question about F-35 sale , and US president Donald Trump lost the election in the US . This took the wind out of the sail of Saudi Arabia & rsquo ; s consideration and of several other country that might have jumped on the peace wagon . & nbsp ; There were consideration about reconciliation after year in which country had a transactional relationship with the Trump administration . Under Trump , Washington had signaled that human right were not an issue . There wa no pressure on Israel regarding Palestinian issue . On the contrary , there wa a & ldquo ; peace to prosperity & rdquo ; plan . & nbsp ; The plan wa unveiled on January 27 , 2020 , but aspect of it had been pushed in 2019 . The US Embassy had been moved in 2018 . Palestinians lost funding and were sidelined . The Jordanian king even went to Turkey for a meeting , and he had hoped Trump would reconsider the embassy move . & nbsp ; BY 2020 , thing were moving in favor of the peace deal , with key work from Jared Kushner and Avi Berkowitz . But calculation have changed in 2021 . & nbsp ; Human-rights group have made a new push to condemn Israel for & ldquo ; apartheid . & rdquo ; There have been call on the Biden administration to pressure Israel . Former CIA director John Brennan and others have led the push , along with critical voice in Congress . & nbsp ; Meanwhile , Netanyahu sought to fly to the UAE for a quick trip to show off the new relation while in the midst of an election campaign . Having twice canceled the trip during the pandemic , he had to cancel again on March 11 , claiming Jordan had prevented a stopover . Embarrassment followed a voice in the UAE expressed concern that they were being embroiled in Israeli politics . & nbsp ; Then came the Jerusalem tension . Failed attempt at Palestinian election and the beginning of Ramadan coincided with Israel & rsquo ; s election on March 23 . Ramadan began on April 21 , and with it came clash . & nbsp ; Nevertheless , the positive relation with the Gulf have continued . UAE Ambassador to Israel Mohamed Al Khaja penned an op-ed at Yediot about his first month in Israel . & nbsp ; However , the scene at al-Aqsa Mosque last Friday were the kind that cause tension in the region . Iran , Hezbollah and Hamas had slammed Israel in the day leading up to the clash . Turkey and Qatar were preparing statement to slam Israel . The US wa expressing concern and demanding de-escalation . European country were following the tension closely . & nbsp ; Instead of listening and trying to reduce the clash , Israeli security force waded into them . Whether that wa due to political uncertainty in Israel , with Netanyahu & rsquo ; s rival gaining in influence , or other issue wa not clear . & nbsp ; The security cabinet met for the first time in month on April 18 . A new crisis after shooting attack in the West Bank ha led Israel to bolster force . Hamas ha fired rocket and threatens more . Israel is holding a large drill preparing for a multifront conflict . & nbsp ; COULD GULF tie be strained by this convergence of trouble ? So far , the statement are what wa to be expected : concern and some mild condemnation ; a desire for stability and for Israel to listen . The question is whether Israel will listen . & nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s relatively cold official relation with Jordan and Egypt , combined with good security relation that largely go unnoticed , are the opposite of the positive tie and human-to-human connection with the Gulf that saw Israelis flock to the region to take part in conference and discus business deal . & nbsp ; However , voice in the UAE cautioned Israel about expecting too much and moving too fast . They certainly were wary of being used for a two-hour photo op by Netanyahu before an election . & nbsp ; Some Israeli right-wing voice in Israel , accustomed to slamming Arab state and never listening to regional voice , have paid lip service to peace with the Gulf . But they still show little interest in listening or taking to heart the need to reduce tension in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Outside of the statement and Jerusalem clash , Israel and it peace partner in the Gulf have much to work on regarding wider issue , such a regional strategy and tie with Greece . There are new deal and initiative moving forward . & nbsp ; There is coexistence . However , the Jerusalem tension are the kind that require sensitive handling and showing respect for the concern of others , a type of language that Jerusalem ha not often used in recent year . & nbsp ; With a new administration in the White House , electoral uncertainty in Israel , and Iran , Turkey , Hamas and Hezbollah chomping at the bit for a showdown with the Jewish state , many challenge are in the air , of which the Gulf & rsquo ; s concern about Jerusalem are just one .",could jerusalem crisis put strain on israel-gulf tie ? - analysis

2021-10-28 20:51:20.727,jpost,"The decision by the Defense Ministry to designate six Palestinian NGOs a arm of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization quickly developed into an international storm , with the US , the UN and the EU raising objection and questioning the validity of the move . & nbsp ; On Monday , European Union Representative to the Palestinians Sven K & uuml ; hn Von Burgsdorff visited the six Palestinian NGOs Defense Minister Benny Gantz had targeted . On Wednesday , representative of 25 Israeli nongovernmental group paid a solidarity visit to the Al-Haq office in Ramallah to voice their opposition to the designation . Two divergent narrative emerged in the wake of the decision . In one reality resides Gantz , the Defense Ministry and pro-Israel NGOs , subscribed to the reality that long-ignored terrorist activity cynically cloaked in the guise of human right ha finally been unmasked . The other narrative considers the six NGOs to be human right organization and considers the designation to be a draconian attack on Palestinian civil society . & nbsp ; On one side , you have Prof . Gerald M . Steinberg , president and founder of NGO Monitor , who say : & ldquo ; There & rsquo ; s no justification for not considering or ignoring or overlooking the terrorist connection . These are not trivial . People & ndash ; Israelis & ndash ; have been killed . & rdquo ; On the other side , there & rsquo ; s Samer Sinijlawi , chairman of the Jerusalem Development Fund and Fatah activist from Jerusalem , who say : & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s just a blind war against all voice that are criticizing the occupation and the abuse of the human right of the Palestinians . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Which reality is true ? Is Israel trying to suppress Palestinian civil society , or is it a legitimate grievance against terrorist organization ? After reviewing the importance of the NGOs and their terrorism connection , where one fall seems to be a matter of priority . PFLP affiliation The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is a Marxist military group recognized a a terrorist group by most of the Western world . & nbsp ; Israel claim that Addameer , Al-Haq , Bisan Center , Defense for Children International & ndash ; Palestine ( DCI-P ) , Union of Agricultural Work Committees ( UAWC ) and the Union of Palestinian Women & rsquo ; s Committees ( UPWC ) are part of a PFLP terrorist network that recruit , provides legitimacy to operative , and serf a a leadership wing for the PFLP . They & rsquo ; ve been accused of funneling funding to terrorism through forgery , laundering , and the awarding of stipend to the family of terrorist . & nbsp ; The government hasn & rsquo ; t provided much information to prove it allegation . But little ha been done to dispute them other than to note the group & rsquo ; status a human right NGOs . This leaf everyone else to make sense of the diverging reality . The NGOs have rejected the claim , but group like NGO Monitor assert that there is enough open source documentation to prove that the only thing under attack is terrorism . Al-Haq Established in 1979 and based in Ramallah , Al-Haq is an award-winning NGO with connection with dozen of international human right bodes , which describes itself a a human right NGO that & ldquo ; document violation of the individual and collective right of Palestinians . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Al-Haq wa the first NGO that drew Steinberg & rsquo ; s suspicion of PFLP connection , & ldquo ; and in many way is the most significant , of the one that were recently designated a terrorist organization , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; Al-Haq is headed by Shawan Jabarin , who sat in Israeli jail for a while , wa convicted of being an activist member of the PFLP , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo ; The court ruled that he is a human right worker by day and a terrorist official by night . & rdquo ; According to NGO Monitor , in 2018 , Visa , Mastercard , and American Express shut down online donation to Al-Haq due to PFLP tie . Al-Haq asserted in a statement that the & ldquo ; baseless allegation & rdquo ; seek & ldquo ; to delegitimize , oppress , silence & rdquo ; Palestinian NGOs . It argued that the decision is not based on security concern , but come due to & ldquo ; the opening of an International Criminal Court investigation . & rdquo ; Sinijlawi find it suspicious that & ldquo ; these organization are leading the procedure in the ICC , where Gantz himself is the main target because he ha been the chief of staff in 2014 . & rdquo ; DCI-P Founded in 1991 , DCI-P is a Palestinian child right organization that provides legal support to Palestinian minor in the Israeli and military court system . & ldquo ; We reject the recent designation a another unjust action by Israeli authority to criminalize and eliminate our lawful human right and child protection work , & rdquo ; said Khaled Quzmar , general director of Defense for Children International & ndash ; Palestine . & ldquo ; When year of delegitimization and disinformation campaign against u have failed to silence our work , Israeli authority now choose to escalate repressive tactic by labeling civil society organization a terrorist . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; We & rsquo ; ve identified five or six different people at different level of the organization that had been active in the PFLP , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo ; One in particular wa the coordinator of DCI-P & rsquo ; s Community Mobilization Unit , Hashem Abu Maria . & rdquo ; Abu Maria wa killed in a clash with the IDF in 2014 and , according to NGO Monitor , wa called & ldquo ; a leader & rdquo ; by PFLP . The designation is not the first time that DCI-P ha faced charge of terrorism . Citibank and Arab Bank PLC reportedly ceased providing service to DCI-P over PFLP link in 2018 . Addameer The Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association , established in 1991 , work and advocate for Palestinians in Israeli prison , & ldquo ; offer free legal aid to political prisoner , & rdquo ; and run social campaign . & ldquo ; They defend mostly PFLP , the people who are accused in the Israeli legal process , & rdquo ; Steinberg noted . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The designation represent an unprecedented & amp ; ominous attempt by the Israeli occupying authority to silence and criminalize Palestinian CSOs that challenge Israel & rsquo ; s prolonged military occupation , & rdquo ; Addameer tweeted . According to Steinberg , Addameer & ldquo ; have a number of staff member who are connected to PFLP . The founder , ( Abdul-Latif Ghait ) wa a member and activist . The former vice chairman . . . Khalida Jarrar . . . she is defined a the head of the PFLP operation in the West Bank . & rdquo ; NGO Monitor claim to have identified at least five other PFLP member in Addameer & rsquo ; s rank . Bisan Center The Bisan Center for Research and Development specializes in socioeconomic right and community engagement . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It should be noted that Bisan Center for Research and Development is an independent , nonpartisan center that is not affiliated with any political entity , & rdquo ; Bisan said in a statement on it Facebook page . & ldquo ; This announcement [ of the terrorist designation ] come after concerted effort in the Israeli occupation & rsquo ; s attempt in a defamation campaign led by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs , & rdquo ; it continued . & ldquo ; The most recent [ Bisan ] executive director . . . wa sentenced for 12 month for recruiting activist , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & nbsp ; Ataraf Rimawi , identified by NGO Monitor a Bisan & rsquo ; s previous executive director , wa noted in a court ruling a a & ldquo ; PFLP member & rdquo ; who & ldquo ; posed a security threat . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; UPWC The UPWC is & ldquo ; a progressive mass feminist organization that wa established in 1980 , & rdquo ; according to it website . & ldquo ; And they have five individual that we & rsquo ; ve identified on the payroll a PFLP people , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo ; One of the founder of the PFLP . . . wa the president of the UPWC . So again , the connection there is pretty strong between [ the UPWC and ] the PFLP . & rdquo ; Israel is not the first to identify UPWC a a PFLP arm . In 2015 , Fatah identified the UPWC a a PFLP affiliate , a did USAID in 1993 . UAWC Among the largest agricultural institution in Palestinian society , UAWC wa established in 1986 to promote Palestinian agricultural development . & ldquo ; They run agricultural project in Gaza and in the West Bank , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo ; And that & rsquo ; s their excuse . That & rsquo ; s the justification for the large amount of funding . They get million from many different European country . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; UAWC reject and condemns Israel & rsquo ; s unsubstantiated allegation directed at UAWC and the other NGOs , which are politically motivated . It is telling that the Israeli government refuse to release any & lsquo ; evidence & rsquo ; substantiating these allegation , & rdquo ; the NGO told The Jerusalem Post . & ldquo ; We have identified seven [ PFLP-affiliated ] individual that have various position [ in UAWC ] , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo ; A number of them have been sentenced in Israel , and , of course , Samir Arbid is standing trial ; he wa their accountant . & rdquo ; Arbid and Razak Farraj , another UAWC member , were arrested for their role in the 2019 terrorist attack that killed Rina Schnerb . & ldquo ; There are hundred of employee who have worked and continue to work at UAWC and thousand of volunteer , & rdquo ; said a UAWC representative . & ldquo ; UAWC , like any other organization , is not responsible for any individual action of any former and current employee . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; We should not forget that Arbid and Farraj have been exposed to horrifying torture to pressure them to give confession , & rdquo ; said the representative . As with UPWC , Fatah and USAID documented that UAWC is a PFLP affiliate . NGO Monitor ha further noted that due to Arbid & rsquo ; s and Farraj & rsquo ; s affiliation , the Netherlands suspended funding to the organization . & nbsp ; The UAWC representative asserted that the funding wa suspended only because of & ldquo ; NGO Monitor & rsquo ; s large incitement campaign against UAWC . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The representative dismissed the USAID designation , saying that the USAID & ldquo ; report [ in which UAWC wa designated a PFLP affiliate ] wa published before the arrival of the Palestinian Authority , and it is a report that talk about the beginning of UAWC and it work , which wa all voluntary . & rdquo ; A few bad egg ? The main evidence for proponent of the designation doesn & rsquo ; t come from the government , but from NGO investigation showing overlap of PFLP member within civil society . & nbsp ; Sinijlawi argues that there are a few flaw in perceiving NGOs a terrorist organization based on a few individual . The NGO could be unaware it ha terrorist in it rank . & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think that , by law , any NGO need to get a security clearance for any person to get employed . If somebody submits the CV and he & rsquo ; s qualified for a job , he get it . & rdquo ; Even if the NGOs were aware , while some country do not differentiate between military and political wing , these NGOs may have . & ldquo ; There could be a military wing inside the Popular Front , but it doe not mean that every student activist . . . is involved in a certain type of violence or military action . & rdquo ; While some of the NGOs may have had violent actor , & ldquo ; it doe not mean that this organization is totally involved into terrorism , & rdquo ; said Sinijlawi . & ldquo ; To blame the whole people because of someone related directly or indirectly to these NGOs . . . it & rsquo ; s a trick that anybody will buy . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not just that they & rsquo ; re member . . . it & rsquo ; s high-level staff , & rdquo ; said Steinberg , dismissing that it & rsquo ; s a few bad egg & ndash ; & ldquo ; in some case , the head of the organization , the people who control the money . & rdquo ; Besides the pattern of NGO employee being PFLP operative , Steinberg noted , PFLP/NGO activist often hold multiple position in different NGOs , including in umbrella organization . & ldquo ; There & rsquo ; s a broader framework called PNGO , Palestinian NGO umbrella Organization . These organization are all member of the PNGO , and the head of the PNGO generally ha been a PFLP official . & rdquo ; NGO or terrorism ? & ldquo ; What doe anybody mean by Palestinian & lsquo ; civil society , & rsquo ; particularly when these organization are very clearly part of a network which is not just terrorist , but it & rsquo ; s also part of the PLO structure ? & rdquo ; Steinberg asks . & ldquo ; What make these organization civil society ? & rdquo ; The NGOs & ldquo ; are very important for Palestinians , & rdquo ; said Sinijlawi . The designation is tantamount to & ldquo ; shutting down the democratic dynamic inside Palestinian society . & rdquo ; On it part , PFLP ha not disputed it connection to the NGOs . & nbsp ; PFLP political bureau & rsquo ; s Kayed al-Ghoul ha said that Palestinians are & ldquo ; proud of the affiliation of any of their son with any national faction that resists the occupation , including the & rdquo ; PFLP . The negative reaction to the terrorism designation show how important these organization are to Palestinians and their ally . & nbsp ; Years of terrorist activity in the midst of Palestinian NGOs show that when it come to terrorist in their rank , the prevailing sentiment in the response from the international community , Palestinian activist , and international body is that you need to break a few bad egg to make an omelet . The two reality may not be so irreconcilable . The NGOs and the terrorist group are interconnected , and while Palestinian civil society may be under attack & ndash ; that may also be legitimate . & bull ;",palestinian ngo : human right worker or agent of terror ?
2023-07-04 20:39:26.083,jpost,"One recipe for a successful military operation is to clearly define goal beforehand , accomplish them , and then end the operation before expanding those goal and risking getting bogged down.As of Tuesday evening , Operation Home and Garden & ndash ; based on these criterion & ndash ; can be considered successful.The stated goal wa to target the terrorist infrastructure in Jenin and degrade the terrorist & rsquo ; capabilities.The IDF successfully knocked out terrorist command center , uncovered weapon lab and arm stockpile , killed nearly a dozen terrorist , and apprehended 10 time that number . It also signaled that it wa ready to end the operation swiftly.The success of the campaignThe campaign seemed successful at an operational and tactical level : well planned and effectively executed , with no IDF fatality a of Tuesday evening and minimal harm to non-combatants.Prevention need to be the next goalBut what come next ? What happens the day after the troop leave Jenin ? This question can be divided into two part : operational and strategic.Operationally , once the IDF leaf Jenin , it must prevent the terrorist from rebuilding the infrastructure there and posing a threat to the country . It must prevent them from building workshop for producing roadside bomb and lab for manufacturing primitive rocket . & nbsp ; The IDF also need to prevent the Jenin refugee camp from again becoming a sanctuary for terrorist carrying out attack on the road in Judea and Samaria.The relatively small number of terrorist killed or apprehended in this operation & ndash ; the IDF ha identified an additional 350 armed terrorist gunman in the city beyond the 120 arrested & ndash ; indicates that they evaded the IDF soldier . They hid but did not vanish , and once the IDF leaf they are likely to be even more motivated to carry out attacks.To prevent the terrorist from launching attack or rebuilding the terrorist infrastructure , the IDF will need to go back into Jenin again and again . This can not be a one-time operation because it effectiveness would rapidly diminish.In a perfect world , or at least in a world run according to agreement reached under the Oslo Accords , the Palestinian Authority security apparatus would be doing this job . But because the PA security apparatus is not fulfilling it responsibility , & nbsp ; the IDF ha to operate in it place . This mean the IDF will need to go into Jenin more frequently to keep the terrorist from having freedom of movement and action.After the IDF withdraws from Jenin , the security force must brace for retaliatory attack of the kind carried out by a lone terrorist in Tel Aviv on Tuesday afternoon.Additionally , they must be prepared for Jewish revenge attack in response to these terror attack . Such action , like the rampage by Jewish extremist in Palestinian town following the murder outside of Eli two week ago and in Huwara earlier this year , are not only morally reprehensible and wrong but also sap international legitimacy for the type of military action taken by Israel in Jenin , and which may become more frequent.As Israel take action to prevent the buildup of terrorist network in the West Bank , encouraged and supported by Iran , Hamas , and Hezbollah , it must also be ready to strike at target in Gaza and Lebanon if terrorist organization there launch rocket toward Israel in a show of solidarity with Jenin . That the recent fighting did not spread to other front this time doe not guarantee the same outcome if similar action are taken in the future.Israel need to define strategic goalsAll that is on the tactical and operational level.On a strategic level , Israel need to define it goal . While the IDF spokesman clarified Operation Home and Garden & rsquo ; s goal over the last few day , emphasizing that the aim wa to target the terrorist infrastructure without occupying and remaining in Jenin , a similar diplomatic goal wa not articulated.The IDF want to degrade the terrorist organization & rsquo ; s capability in Jenin , but what happens afterward ? What is Israel & rsquo ; s vision for Jenin ? Does it want the Palestinian Authority to regain control of the city ? If so , what political , diplomatic , or financial incentive is it willing to give the Palestinian Authority to motivate it to reassert it control ? In addition , Israel must determine how far it is willing to go and what action it is prepared to take to weaken Hamas , which is the Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s main rival.During a Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting last month , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that while Israel want to eliminate the Palestinian aspiration for statehood , it & ldquo ; need & rdquo ; the Palestinian Authority and can not & ldquo ; allow it to collapse . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; We are prepared to help it financially . We have an interest in the Palestinian Authority continuing to work , & rdquo ; he said.Following the Jenin operation , Netanyahu must define what exactly that mean and outline the step he is willing to take to strengthen the PA so it will have incentive to regain security control in area like Jenin.When Naftali Bennett wa prime minister in 2021 , he spoke of & ldquo ; shrinking the conflict & rdquo ; with the Palestinians . This meant increasing Palestinian sovereignty through building a network of roadblock-free road controlled by the Palestinians , expanding Palestinian housing and infrastructure , implementing measure to boost the Palestinian economy , and decreasing Israel & rsquo ; s footprint in Palestinian-controlled areas.Although this fell far short of the Palestinian aspiration for statehood , it wa something.So far , the Netanyahu government ha not held out any diplomatic horizon for the Palestinians , and instead ha approved thousand of new housing unit in the settlement and green-lighted an expedited planning process for more.This reflects internal division within the government . While Netanyahu speaks of not wanting to bring about the collapse of the Palestinian Authority or annexing the West Bank , other voice & ndash ; such a those of Bezalel Smotrich & ndash ; advocate the opposite.Following the event in Jenin , Netanyahu need to decide what the government want . If the aim is to collaborate with the Palestinian Authority , action should be taken to strengthen it and weaken it enemy . But if the goal is to undermine the Palestinian Authority , Israel should begin preparing to fill the void created when the PA collapse . This week & rsquo ; s action in Jenin offer a glimpse of what may await throughout Judea and Samaria if this is the chosen course . & nbsp ;",jenin operation : what is meant to happen next ? - analysis

Settlers overnight attacked the nearby Palestinian town of Turmus Ayya setting home and car ablaze . One Palestinian man wa killed during the violence . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We strongly condemn yesterday & rsquo ; s terror attack & rdquo ; outside Eli , Patel said , adding that there is & ldquo ; no justification for terrorism . & rdquo ; Overall , he said , & ldquo ; We are deeply concerned by the rising level of violence in the West Bank in recent month . & rdquo ; `` We are deeply concerned by the rising level of violence in the West Bank in recent month `` & nbsp ; State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant PatelBut his harshest word were for the settler attack .

All citizen of Israel are obligated to obey the law . & rdquo ; He specifically mentioned that the statement applied to the West Bank.Netanyahu approves 1,000 new settler home in response to terrorThe Eli attack had already prompted a response from Netanyahu & rsquo ; s office which announced Israel & rsquo ; s intention to advance plan for 1,000 new home Eli . `` Our answer to terrorism is to strike it hard and build our country , & rdquo ; Netanyahu & rsquo ; s office stated.Netanyahu approved the move together with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , who hold a ministerial position in the Defense Ministry.Patel spoke out against the move . & ldquo ; Unilateral action such a settlement advancement will only incite tension and undermine the prospect of a two-state solution , & rdquo ; he stated.Those unit would be in addition to the 4,560 new home the Civil Administration & rsquo ; s Higher Planning Council plan to advance when it convenes later this month . It is expected to approve the deposit of a plan for 500 new home in Eli.The construction of 1,500 unit would more than double the size of the community , which according to the Central Bureau of Statistics had a population of 4,613 in 2021 . & nbsp ; Eli is located close to 24 kilometer over the pre-1967 line , off of Route 60 in the Binyamin region . Like all of the West Bank settlement , former US President Donald Trump & rsquo ; s peace plan drew it into the section of Area C over which Israel would eventually be allowed to apply sovereignty.It is , however , outside the boundary of the security barrier . The international community and the Israeli Left hold that it is an isolated settlement outside the bloc and located so deep into the West Bank that it presence make it more difficult to create a viable Palestinian state in Area C.The international community had already condemned Israel this week over the intention to advance 4,560 home and the amendment to a 1996 government decision that would fast-track the approval process for settler building projects.Separately settler family returned to the Evyatar outpost in the Samaria region of the West Bank , a fledgling hilltop community they voluntarily abandoned two year ago after striking an agreement with the government that the hilltop would be legalized a a new settlement starting with the approval for the construction of a yeshiva at the site.To date , neither the previous government or the existing one ha kept their pledge in that regard.Yesha Council head Shlomo Ne & rsquo ; eman said of the new building announcement , & ldquo ; To those who wish u harm , know that we are here to stay . Terrorism will not defeat u . We will continue to live and flourish in the land of our ancestor . & rdquo ; While the international attention which had at first focused on condemning the Eli terror attack turned to statement against settlement building and violence , Israel & rsquo ; s Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan called for the Security Council to condemn the Eli attack and hold the Palestinian Authority accountable for inciting terror . & ldquo ; Heinous attack & rdquo ; such a what happened in Eli & ldquo ; are a direct result of deliberate incitement by Palestinian terror organization , a well a the Palestinian Authority , which continues to finance the salary of murderer and their family through the Palestinian Authority & rsquo ; s despicable & lsquo ; pay-for-slay & rsquo ; policy & rdquo ; by which stipend are giving to terrorist and their families.This & ldquo ; stand in clear contravention of international law concerning the financing of terrorism .

2022-05-13 13:03:44.533,jpost,"The tragic death of veteran Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin on Wednesday morning came a Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh wa visiting Brussels , where he attended a meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee , a body whose primary function is to coordinate the delivery of international aid to the Palestinians.Established in 1993 , the AHLC ha been meeting at least twice a year under the chairmanship of Norway.This year & rsquo ; s meeting came amid report that some of the Western donor country were refusing to provide additional financial aid to the PA unless it implement major reform , especially in the field of education . The proposed reform basically call for change in the Palestinian school textbook , which are written by PA professional whose salary are directly funded by the European Union.Shtayyeh went to the meeting with the hope of convincing the donor that the PA wa serious about implementing large-scale reform not only in the education sector , but in other field , too.And a in previous meeting , Shtayyeh used the platform to launch a scathing attack on Israel , accusing it of engaging in a & ldquo ; systematic destruction of the two-state solution by allowing settler to invade the Aqsa Mosque , preventing Palestinians from entering Jerusalem , in addition to field execution and arrest . & rdquo ; Referring to the severe financial crisis in the PA , the PA premier said that the Palestinians have started recovering from the coronavirus pandemic crisis , and that the Gross Domestic Product rose about 7 % in 2021 . & ldquo ; The Palestinian economy suffers from a defect in it structure , & rdquo ; Shtayyeh told the donor . & ldquo ; It is a besieged economy that doe not control it resource or capability , and it exists in an exceptional situation imposed by the reality of the occupation and it procedure . & rdquo ; He revealed that the rate of unemployment decreased in the last quarter of 2021 to 13 % , after having reached 18 % in 2019 . This , Shtayyeh said , wa due to new job opportunity in the West Bank and work in Israel.A report submitted to the AHLC by the Quartet , which consists of the US , EU , United Nations and Russia , noted that the PA continues to face a dire financial situation resulting from diminished economic growth , a marked decline in donor funding and Israeli deduction from clearance revenue ( in response to payment made by the PA to family of Palestinians involved in terrorist attack against Israelis ) . In 2021 , the PA & rsquo ; s deficit reached $ 757 million & ndash ; approximately 4.4 % of GDP & ndash ; despite GDP growth of 6 % , an increase in gross local revenue of $ 1.5 billion and a decrease in government expenditure . During the same year , deduction by Israel from clearance revenue reached $ 282m . , representing 37 % of the budgetary deficit . & ldquo ; Projections for 2022 by the PA portray a similarly grim fiscal situation , & rdquo ; according to the Quartet report . & ldquo ; Despite projecting 3 % growth in GDP and 8 % in gross revenue , the PA & rsquo ; s fiscal deficit is expected to reach $ 558m . Addressing that gap will require structural change , internal fiscal reform , improved economic growth , and the resolution of a number of long-discussed but still outstanding Israeli-Palestinian fiscal file . & rdquo ; Shtayyeh presented to the donor a plan that includes 21 step for reform related to administrative , financial , security , social and economic issue . & ldquo ; Whatever reform we make , they alone are not sufficient to address the imbalance in the Palestinian economic structure , because it is under occupation , & rdquo ; he argued . & ldquo ; Therefore , Israel must take measure on it part , and the support of donor country must continue to enable u to continue fulfilling our obligation . & rdquo ; Shtayyeh did not refer to the issue of anti-Israel incitement . But the plan he presented to the donor country argued that , a part of the reform process , the PA will work toward promoting and protecting the Palestinian national narrative and culture . & ldquo ; Information about Palestine is being deliberately distorted by the Israeli occupying authority , and , a part of this process , Palestinian folklore , heritage and archaeological artifact are being stolen , & rdquo ; the plan stated . & ldquo ; A battle is being waged over the narrative dominating the conflict . It is important that our national culture , grounded on the Palestinian identity , should be consolidated and protected . & rdquo ; THE NEWS OF Abu Akleh & rsquo ; s death came a Shtayyeh wa meeting with Roberta Metsola , president of the European Parliament , and other EU official on the sideline of the AHLC meeting.The widespread condemnation of the incident have since been used by Shtayyeh and other Palestinian official to garner additional support for the Palestinians & rsquo ; case , promote the Palestinian narrative , and shift the blame onto Israel . The ultimate goal : to ramp up the narrative according to which the Palestinians are the & ldquo ; victim of the Israeli occupation . & rdquo ; In a statement from Brussels , Shtayyeh wrote that & ldquo ; Shireen wa killed by the Israeli occupation while documenting their horrific crime against our people . & rdquo ; He later urged the senior EU official to pressure Israel & ldquo ; to stop all it unilateral measure and violation against our people and to allow the holding of election in occupied Jerusalem . & rdquo ; It & rsquo ; s not clear at this stage whether Shtayyeh wa successful in persuading the donor country to resume or increase their financial aid to the Palestinians . The killing of Abu Akleh may significantly contribute to the Palestinians & rsquo ; diplomatic and medium warfare against Israel , but it will not necessarily bring more money into the coffer of the PA.The Europeans and other Western donor have , at least in the past few year , been exerting heavy pressure on the PA to end the incitement and tone down it rhetoric against Israel.For now , it & rsquo ; s evident that the pressure ha proven to be ineffective.In fact , it seems that matter have been going in the opposite direction . The voice and message emanating from Ramallah and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip have become even more toxic , a evidenced before and during Ramadan.Allegations that Jewish settler are & ldquo ; storming & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; desecrating & rdquo ; the Aqsa Mosque during their tour of the Temple Mount are sounded almost every day in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . Senior PA and Hamas official don & rsquo ; t miss an opportunity to accuse Israel of planning to & ldquo ; commit crime & rdquo ; against one of Islam & rsquo ; s holiest site , Jerusalem , and the Palestinian people.Against this backdrop , terrorist attack were carried out in Beersheba , Bnei Brak , Tel Aviv , Elad and Jerusalem . The attack , which resulted in the death of 19 people , are said to be connected , directly and indirectly , to the tension at the Temple Mount and Jerusalem.Yet , just a the tension and violence appeared to be fading away , the incident involving the popular Al Jazeera journalist took Israel and the Palestinians back to square one . The PA , Hamas and other Palestinian faction and party are now using the tragedy to further whip up anti-Israel sentiment among the Palestinians.The protest against the killing of Abu Akleh are likely to continue in the coming day and week . The protest , which coincide with the first anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war , could escalate during the Palestinians & rsquo ; annual commemoration of Nakba Day on May 15 in protest against the establishment of Israel.The PA is now hoping to turn the tragedy of the reporter into a new version of the incident involving Mohammed al-Durrah , the 12-year-old boy who wa killed in the Gaza Strip in 2000 after being caught in a crossfire between the IDF and Palestinian security forces.The main goal is to increase the international pressure on Israel to halt all it practice in Jerusalem and the West Bank , including construction in the settlement and security measure at the Temple Mount.The PA & rsquo ; s effort are directed mainly toward the US and the EU.PA President Mahmoud Abbas want the Biden administration to & ldquo ; end it silence & rdquo ; and increase it involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.He want the Biden administration to exert crushing pressure on the Israeli government to stop all IDF & ldquo ; incursion & rdquo ; into Palestinian city and village . He also want the Biden administration to fulfill all it promise to the Palestinians , especially the commitment to the reopening of the US Consulate in Jerusalem.On the other hand , Abbas and his official want the EU and other Western donor to unconditionally resume their financial aid to the PA.Meanwhile , there & rsquo ; s growing concern in Ramallah over the rising influence and popularity of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the West Bank . While it & rsquo ; s true that the IDF crackdown on Hamas and PIJ member serf the interest of Abbas , it nevertheless underscore the weakness and alleged collaboration of the PA with Israel . Each IDF operation and each killing of a Palestinian further erodes the Palestinian public & rsquo ; s confidence in Abbas and the PA.For now , all eye in Ramallah are set on the upcoming visit of Biden to the region.The PA is hoping that Biden will carry with him a number of gift for the Palestinians . The talk about the possibility that the US president may visit a hospital in east Jerusalem without the presence of Israeli security officer ha already sent a positive message to the PA & ndash ; namely , that the US considers east Jerusalem a the capital of a future Palestinian state.But the PA know that a visit to a hospital carry more symbolism than substance , which is why Abbas ha made it clear that he expects the Biden administration to & ldquo ; translate it word into deed & rdquo ; and fulfill all it promise to the Palestinians without delay.Abbas & rsquo ; s main message to the Americans and Europeans is : Submit to my demand , or the Palestinian Authority will collapse , and you will have a Hamas takeover of the West Bank .",pa is ramping up the ' victim of the israeli occupation ' narrative

For Chikli , a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s right-wing Likud party , it & rsquo ; s the latest stop in a tour of engagement with European politician who advocate pro-Israel position from party with antisemitic and neo-Nazi roots.Both Chikli and Javier Milei , Argentina & rsquo ; s new right-wing , pro-Israeli president , were invited to address the conference . In his speech , Chikli lambasted Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez , who ha sharply criticized Israel & rsquo ; s war against Hamas , which Chikli called & ldquo ; an existential battle for the future of humanity . & rdquo ; In Spain , Vox is controversial both for it platform & mdash ; which includes restricting abortion access , repealing domestic violence law , and shuttering the ministry of equality & mdash ; and for a history of neo-Nazis in it rank . Five year ago , the party nominated Holocaust revisionist Fernando Paz a a congressional candidate . Paz ha said the fact of the Holocaust are & ldquo ; far from being established with accuracy & rdquo ; and called the Nuremberg trial a & ldquo ; farce . & rdquo ; Vox is also home to Jordi de la Fuente , a member of the Barcelona government who previously led the neo-fascist Republican Social Movement , which dissolved in 2018 . Other Vox member have included Jos & eacute ; Mar & iacute ; a Ruiz Puerta , who led the neo-Nazi group CEDADE , and Jos & eacute ; Ignacio Vega Peinado , who wa part of the neo-Nazi group Radical Action in the 1990s and received prison time for attacking and permanently disabling a professor at the University of Valencia.Pedro Valera , a leader of Spanish neo-Nazism who ha served jail time for disseminating hate speech , also recently appeared at Vox & rsquo ; s closing campaign ceremony in Barcelona.Until recently , official in the Likud party were discouraged from promoting alliance with Vox . In 2019 , Netanyahu & rsquo ; s then-foreign affair director Eli Hazan tweeted his support for the party and faced enough backlash to delete and apologize for the post.Growing tie between Israel 's Likud and Spain 's Vox party & nbsp ; But those boundary have disappeared under Israel & rsquo ; s current right-wing government . In December , Chikli met with Vox president Santiago Abascal , whom he called & ldquo ; a man of truth who , in the twilight of Western civilization , where moral relativism threatens to collapse it , stand a a beacon of moral clarity . & rdquo ; Last month , Chikli attended CPAC Hungary and praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban a a & ldquo ; supporter of Israel . & rdquo ; ( The authoritarian leader ha been condemned by US antisemitism envoy Deborah Lipstadt for & ldquo ; rhetoric that clearly evokes Nazi racial ideology , & rdquo ; a well a by Hungarian rabbi . ) Chikli spoke alongside Tom Van Grieken , president of Belgium & rsquo ; s Vlaams Belang party , which promotes the & ldquo ; Great Replacement & rdquo ; conspiracy theory and us the Nazi term & ldquo ; omvolking & rdquo ; ( & ldquo ; repopulation & rdquo ; ) , mainly referring to European immigration from Muslim countries.Chikli also met earlier this year with Sweden & rsquo ; s far-right party , the Swedish Democrats . The second-largest party in the Swedish parliament , it ha a history of Nazi founder and it member have been criticized for connection with neo-Nazi movement even in recent year . Israel ha so far avoided establishing official tie with the party , but the Swedish Democrats & nbsp ; have declared it & ldquo ; the most pro-Israel party in Sweden . & rdquo ; Chikli & rsquo ; s ministry is charged with engaging and supporting the half of Jews who do not live in Israel ; he added fighting antisemitism to it mandate when he assumed the position last year . But while Chikli is strengthening his bond with far-right European party , he ha said that he is not interested in building a relationship with some Jews around the world.In January , at a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association in Krakow , Chikli said his official capacity would not induce him to build alliance with Diaspora Jews who participate in international protest against Israel & rsquo ; s military assault in Gaza . & ldquo ; A Jew who feel at home surrounded by a mob that is shouting , & lsquo ; From the river to the sea , Palestine will be free , & rsquo ; I don & rsquo ; t consider him a Jew , & rdquo ; Chikli told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency . & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t want to build a bridge with him . & rdquo ;",israeli minister address convention hosted by spanish far-right party with neo-nazi tie

2024-04-13 13:43:13.567,jpost,"The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the petition filed by human right organization on behalf of the parent of Iyad al-Halak , who wa killed by an Israeli police officer four year ago in Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Old CityThe petition wa against the decision of the Police Investigation Department and the State Attorney & rsquo ; s Office not to appeal the Jerusalem District Court & rsquo ; s ruling that acquitted the Border Police officer who killed Halak in May 2020.According to the investigation , Halak , 32 , wa walking to the special need school where he both worked and studied . He noticed two police officer shouting and running toward him and immediately ran off.Police gave chase and fired two shot in Halak & rsquo ; s direction . He kept running and eventually went into a nearby shed , where another officer opened fire and wounded him . A third officer reportedly shot Halak while he wa lying on the ground , killing him instantly.Following a police investigation in October 2020 , the officer who shot Halak dead wa charged with manslaughter , which Adalah , an Arab minority right group , say almost never occurs . However , the officer wa acquitted on all charge in July 2023.The officer & rsquo ; s claim of & ldquo ; perceived self-defense & rdquo ; wa accepted by the court a legitimate . Following the ruling , Adalah and the Meezan Organization for Human Rights ( Nazareth ) filed a petition on behalf of Halak & rsquo ; s parent , claiming that the decision wa extremely unreasonable and warranted Supreme Court review . & nbsp ; Setting a new precedentThe petition argued that the court & rsquo ; s ruling set new legal norm , and failing to challenge them would have significant legal consequences.According to the petition , the decision effectively lower the threshold for the justifiable use of lethal force by police officer , which could virtually eliminate all criminal accountability in case where Palestinians are killed by law enforcement.In addition , the petition argued that the judgment unreasonably expands the parameter of self-defense in criminal law , relying solely on the officer & rsquo ; s subjective perception of danger.The Supreme Court reviewed the argument and rejected the need for an appeal . Justices David Mintz , Khaled Kabub , and Ruth Ronnen handed down the judgment unanimously.Most case in the Supreme Court are overseen by three of the 15 sitting justice , with only major case receiving the full attention of the court.The Supreme Court said that there wa no basis for judicial interference and that it would only do so in highly exceptional and exceedingly rare cases.The court rejected argument that the Police or the State Attorney & rsquo ; s Office had been influenced by outside factor . The court also dismissed the petition & rsquo ; s assertion that it would set a legal precedent .",supreme court upholds decision not to appeal acquittal of officer who killed iyad al-hallak

And ordinary citizen have risen to the occasion , searching for any way they could contribute to the war effort.The Kovacs familyAmong them is Chava Kovacs , a mother of seven child ranging in age from six to 14 . Residents of the ultra-Orthodox settlement of Tel Zion in Judea and Samaria , she and her husband have been hosting a family of eight from the southern city of Ashdod since the beginning of the current war ; the eldest child is eight and a half year old ; the youngest is two months.The Kovacs family made aliyah from Calgary in 2006 and speak English among themselves . Chava wa born in Poland and raised in the western Canadian city ; her husband , Hillel , grew up in Florida . & ldquo ; When we signed up to host a family , there wa an option to specify haredi/religious / secular , etc . We checked the & lsquo ; It doesn & rsquo ; t matter , send anyone & rsquo ; button , & rdquo ; Chava told the Magazine . & ldquo ; Our guest are a Sephardi haredi family . They don & rsquo ; t speak any English . We can manage in Hebrew but prefer English , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We & rsquo ; re different in some way . They & rsquo ; re a kollel family ( meaning the husband study Torah during the day ) ; my husband work . We & rsquo ; re a little more relaxed about what we allow our kid to see on medium . We allow wholesome content , even if it & rsquo ; s secular . & rdquo ; Nevertheless , & ldquo ; they are very nice , sweet people , and very appreciative , & rdquo ; Chava continued . & ldquo ; They are thankful for the opportunity to get away from all the siren and for being able to go outside freely rather than being trapped in the house . They don & rsquo ; t seem traumatized or shocked . But yes , being constantly awakened by siren when you have young child is unbearable . & rdquo ; THE ADJUSTMENT , she said , ha not been too difficult . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Their kid are younger than mine , so there & rsquo ; s more cry than before ; but otherwise , it & rsquo ; s great to help someone . And my kid have new friend to play with , which is so important , since school ha been canceled . My kid really enjoy showing the Ashdod kid around all our park . My eldest took them to the petting zoo on our yishuv the other day . It gave him something fun to do . & rdquo ; Even though Chava and Hillel are immigrant , their child are & ldquo ; typical Israeli kid who grew up here . They understand English but are most comfortable speaking Hebrew & rdquo ; & ndash ; which help in this case . & ldquo ; Eliyahu , the father of the Ashdod child , now ha the opportunity to learn with his hevruta ( study partner ) by phone . He & rsquo ; s around some of the time . Baruch Hashem ( thank God ) , we have a big apartment with five bedroom , so everyone ha a little space , & rdquo ; she explained.How doe she manage to feed so many people ? & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m just making more food and serving simple meal like pita and falafel or meatball with mashed potato and veggie . Their child are young , but still I definitely feel some pressure making sure we have enough food . Basically , I just put out a bunch of container on the table , and everyone take what they want . & ldquo ; We have a small Crockpot , so I borrowed a big one from a friend , & rdquo ; she added.Several charitable organization have publicized their willingness to help family in various central location that are hosting others from more volatile area . Chava said she ha been getting some help from a hessed ( kindness ) kitchen in their community that help new mother , people in hospital , and others during challenging times.The Magazine asked if the Ashdod mother ha been helping with the preparation . & ldquo ; She helped cut potato today , but really , she ha a new baby and a few small child , so I & rsquo ; m happy to let her relax a bit . She said she & rsquo ; s helping me tomorrow with the Shabbat cooking , & rdquo ; Chava replied during the interview last Thursday . & ldquo ; She & rsquo ; s really sweet and want to help . & rdquo ; AS FOR keeping the child busy , the family received permission from the community center to use the local Gymboree at no cost & ldquo ; any time they feel like it . & rdquo ; If closed , they can take the key . & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m usually not a person who ha house guest , aside from nephew or my friend & rsquo ; s son who are here studying for the year , & rdquo ; Chava said . & ldquo ; My house look & lsquo ; lived in , & rsquo ; and our Shabbat meal aren & rsquo ; t so fancy . My kid chatter a lot at the table . But this family that we & rsquo ; re hosting , because they & rsquo ; re used to it , are just so happy to be here . I & rsquo ; m not bothered that they see that my sink is always full of dish . & ldquo ; I wish I could be a Henny Machlis , & rdquo ; she said of the late rebbetzen who wa famous for her remarkable charitable work and hospitality and would host 200 people every week on Shabbat . & ldquo ; But this is finally my chance to get a little closer to her example . & rdquo ; Chava hope that this experience will serve a an example to her child a well . & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m hoping that my kid will look back on the war with some happy memory of having guest with cute little child rather than being miserable about the situation , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s a good distraction to have other people to think about and something tangible to do to help . & rdquo ; As for residing in the West Bank , & ldquo ; We & rsquo ; re fortunate to live here , a much a we & rsquo ; re so close to Ramallah . We very rarely have siren and missile , & rdquo ; she said , adding that & ldquo ; with their bad aim , & rdquo ; the Hamas terrorist would be more likely to hit a surrounding Palestinian village than the Jewish settlement . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I think our Ashdod family is happy , & rdquo ; she concluded . & ldquo ; Tel Zion is a nice community . They don & rsquo ; t care that our apartment isn & rsquo ; t 100 % clean or that it & rsquo ; s a little run down .

2021-05-25 11:51:01.727,jpost,"A month before the Gaza war , thing were going well for Israel . The Abraham Accords were going strong and a vaccination campaign had made Israel an envy during the pandemic . The peace agreement appeared to herald a new era in the Middle East and all that wa required wa to keep Iran and it proxy from trying to destabilize the region . A new US administration wa keen to increase the US role around the world and support human right . That might mean no more chaotic policy , like the flip-flop of the Syria withdrawal in 2018-2019 . & nbsp ; On May 22 , after the recent Gaza war , the Palestinian Authority mufti wa expelled from al-Aqsa for not supporting Hamas . Hamas wa riding a wave of popular support , claiming it had defeated Israel . Protests in many country had targeted Jews and article slamming Israel were being printed in newspaper worldwide . China had led effort at the UN critiquing Israel and in the US , several far-left member of the Democratic Party were calling Israel & ldquo ; apartheid & rdquo ; and pushing to stop arm sale . Israel support wa declining among key supporter , such a American Evangelicals . Hamas wa more popular than ever suddenly and it wasn & rsquo ; t even being condemned for firing 4,000 rocket at Israeli civilian , of which some 60 fell in Israeli city and town . There & rsquo ; s talk now of a shift in how country will approach Hamas and it ha received more legitimacy in the week since the war than in the decade prior . Hezbollah and Iran were empowered and not deterred . Pakistan & rsquo ; s top diplomat wa spouting antisemitism on CNN , and Turkey , along with Iran , wa leading the charge to sanction and isolate Israel . In the West Bank , Palestinians were celebrating the Hamas victory . Groups like Human Rights Watch and other anti-Israel group were talking Israel & ldquo ; apartheid & rdquo ; and arguing for a one-state solution . Anti-Israel activist sensed the tide had turned : Israel could be eliminated a a & ldquo ; settler-colonial state . & rdquo ; Iran agreed . & nbsp ; How did it come to this ? ISRAEL HAD largely kept Hamas isolated and ossified in Gaza since the 2014 war . Cut off from many supply by Egypt , it had few friend . It had tried to expand that dwindling support abroad in 2019 and 2020 through visit to Turkey , Malaysia , Qatar and Iran . However , Israel & rsquo ; s new relationship in the Gulf appeared to show that Israel wa now accepted in the region and a new alliance with Greece and Cyprus could promise new energy deal . Turkey , concerned about the incoming presidency of Joe Biden , wa talking reconciliation across the region after being empowered by the Trump administration . The US wa & ldquo ; back , & rdquo ; Biden said . & nbsp ; When the Biden administration came into office it wa after an unprecedented era of uncertainty in the US , with COVID and the former US President refusing to concede . The Middle East wa not a priority . Israel had close cooperation with US Central Command and good relation with the US regarding it desire to protect it interest . It wa able to act against Iranian entrenchment in Syria . There wa no big push for peace . There wasn & rsquo ; t even a new US ambassador in Jerusalem . But a slow drumbeat wa beginning . In preparation for the incoming Biden administration , the human right group B & rsquo ; Tselem released a report on Israel apartheid . By April 27 , Human Rights Watch would follow suit . On April 29 , the Palestinian Authority postponed it election , fearing a Hamas victory . Israel had held election on March 31 and continued to be divided . It wa the fourth election in two year . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did little to form a coalition . A ray of hope wa the rise of Ra & rsquo ; am and it head Mansour Abbas . He looked willing to join an opposition coalition after breaking from the Joint List . By May 5 , President Reuven Rivlin had tasked Yair Lapid with forming a government after Netanyahu failed once again to create a coalition . MEANWHILE , tension were growing in Jerusalem . Ramadan had begun and with , it there were clash with Israeli police at Damascus Gate . After attack on Orthodox Jews there wa a right-wing rally on April 22 and several were wounded . A dispute in east Jerusalem @ @ @ s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood began to get some international and Palestinian attention . Hamas vowed to defend Al-Aqsa . On Quds ( Jerusalem ) Day , May 7 , Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said Israel wa a terrorist state . Iran & rsquo ; s IRGC head Hossein Salami also slammed the Jewish state and predicted that it could suffer a tactical defeat or be blockaded at sea . Hamas and Hezbollah made similar statement . Hamas warned Israel that it would respond to Jerusalem clash and on May 10 , to coincide with Israel & rsquo ; s Jerusalem Day march , fired rocket at Jerusalem . Israel , with Lapid and Naftali Bennett seeking to form a coalition to replace Netanyahu , began airstrikes on Gaza . By May 12 , Bennett had ended discussion on a new government . Riots across Israel in Arab and mixed town created a crisis . Border Police were rushed to Lod . Attacks and lynching began on both side from Bat Yam to Umm al-Fahm , Rahat , Jaffa and other place . There had been clash in Jaffa since April 20 . Now thing took a turn for the worse . Israel called up almost 10,000 reservist , and sent Golani and 7th Armored soldier to the border of Gaza . It rushed support to the West Bank where shooting attack and clash grew . The attack had begun with Palestinian terror cell targeting the Tapuah junction in early May . Another shooting attack took place on May 7 , near a post at Salem in the West Bank . Israel said the shooter were planning a worse attack . & nbsp ; WHEN ISRAEL retaliated on May 10 , Hamas put into action a plan to use thousand of rocket to pound Ashkelon , Ashdod and Tel Aviv , a well a Israeli airport and population center . It used drone and planned to use unmanned submarine . It sent anti-tank guided missile ( ATGM ) team to the border to strike at Israeli vehicle . This wa a sophisticated , planned operation , in which up to 140 Hamas rocket would be fired at once in massive barrage . Hamas had perfected this over the year with various rocket attack at sea , practicing for this scenario . It also showed off new long-range rocket with a range of up to 250 km . , targeting Eilat and perhaps Dimona a well . It knew that a Syrian S-200 had been fired that triggered alert near Dimona on April 22 . & nbsp ; With Iranian support , there were attack in the North a well . On May 13 , rocket were fired into the sea from Lebanon and protester laid siege to Israel @ @ @ s border with it northern neighbor on May 18 . It may have come from Iraq . Rockets fired on May 19 even flew near Kiryat Yam , near Haifa . This wa a serious incident . It followed the April 27 downing of a Hezbollah drone . & nbsp ; Now Hamas and Fatah activist are battling over Al-Aqsa , a clash showed on May 23 , and Hamas is saying that it war ha harmed the Abraham Accords . & nbsp ; It & rsquo ; s not clear whether Hamas knew it plan would work or the degree to which Iran advised Hamas on this strategy . It is also not clear if the benefit to Hamas and Iran wa merely a lucky turn of event for them and that timing dictated the need to go to war but the result were far from certain . Clearly , Hamas didn & rsquo ; t have much to lose . Israel , on the other hand , ha much to lose and it had diminishing return from it year of sunk cost in Gaza . Iran and Hezbollah wanted to test Israel & rsquo ; s defense . It increasingly appears Israel walked into a trap in Gaza . It wa a trap partially of Israel & rsquo ; s own making due to not having a new government and having strategic planning concentrated in Netanyahu & rsquo ; s office without check and balance and broader security cabinet discussion . & nbsp ;",did israel walk into a hamas trap in gaza ?

This year , the first since October 7 changed Israel forever , it wa unfathomable.No firework , no raucous party in the park with the country & rsquo ; s top talent belting out the hit , and no kid attacking each other with string spray.According to most report , the street were generally extremely quiet for Independence Day , a many of the populace preferred to stay close to home and hunker down with their family and friend for more intimate commemorations.Dueling ceremony touted the country & rsquo ; s irrefutable achievement and it citizen & rsquo ; bravery ( the official state-sponsored event ) on the one hand , and on the other hand , spotlighted the hostage held in Gaza by Hamas and the inability to celebrate amid a bloody war that ha seen thousand of soldier killed or wounded ( the alternative grassroots event ) . The different reality Israel encountersLooking on a split screen , one could ask which wa the real Israel at 76 ? They both reflect a reality of where the country is at this most precarious moment in it short life . The only conclusion that can be drawn is that they & rsquo ; re both accurate and reflect the pain , uncertainty , and sadness that exemplified this year & rsquo ; s Remembrance and Independence Days , a well a the pride in the accomplishment of the world & rsquo ; s only Jewish state.We & rsquo ; re a broken , damaged country , filled with question about it government and institution that enabled October 7 to take place or why it did not succeed in the last seven month of the war to defeat Hamas or bring the more than 130 hostage or their remains back home.Yet , taking a step back , it & rsquo ; s undeniable that Israel 's last 76 year are a huge success story & ndash ; a triumph of human spirit unmatched in recent history.That doesn & rsquo ; t help fill the agonizing void and anguish the country felt this week , however . The 24 hour of Remembrance Day , filled with heart-wrenching story of the oh-so-fresh death of so many people who were so full of life and had so much to offer , wa too much to bear.But , bear it we do - because there & rsquo ; s no alternative . This year & rsquo ; s Independence Day , rather than a celebration , wa more like a reminder that yes , no matter how bleak thing may seem right now , we & rsquo ; re still here and what we & rsquo ; ve built and cherish is still worth fighting for.Every day in Israel is Remembrance and Independence Day . We can never forget the sacrifice made by so many to establish the country and bring it to the great height it achieved in it first 76 year . At the same time , we can never take it independence for granted.Rather than the usual over-the-top merriment , the last 24 hour offered a bear hug to people desperately in need of it . We & rsquo ; re a long way from starting a healing process & ndash ; one that will take year to complete , if ever.That will only begin once the hostage are freed , Hamas is rendered not to be a formidable threat to Israel & rsquo ; s security any longer , our soldier stop dying in the Gaza battlefield , and the resident of the North feel safe enough to return to their home . And , of course , all of that is bracketed by the prime minister and the head of the country & rsquo ; s security apparatus resigning for their role in not preventing October 7.Until that time , Israelis need to ask themselves : Is what unifies u more powerful than what separate u ? If the answer is yes , then there & rsquo ; s hope that Israel & rsquo ; s 77th Independence Day will be more joyous than the one that just sunk under the exhaustion of war and sorrow . & nbsp ;",looking at a split screen on independence day - comment

And I can assure you , the vast majority of Israelis and all responsible leader in the world understand that this should be resisted , & rdquo ; he said.The ICC pre-trial chamber ha yet to approve Khan & rsquo ; s request . If it doe , the warrant would be the first issued against leader of a democratic country.Israel and the United States are not among the 124 country that are party to the Rome Statute which governs the ICC .

I think that the prosecutor should be concerned about his status because he 's really turning the ICC into a pariah institution . & ldquo ; People are just not going to take it seriously .

It & rsquo ; s not serious , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said.Fanning the flame of antisemitismHe accused Khan of & ldquo ; pouring gasoline on the fire of anti-Semitism that are spreading around the world because he is attacking the one and only Jewish state & ldquo ; which is fighting an existential war against Hamas.Norway wa not the only country to back the court . The French Foreign Ministry said it supported the ICC & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; independence and the fight against impunity in all situation . & rdquo ; As far a Israel is concerned , it will be up to the court 's pre-trial chamber to decide whether to issue these warrant , after examining the evidence put forward by the prosecutor , `` the ministry said.Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne , however , told the National Assembly on Tuesday that the `` simultaneous `` warrant request must not establish an `` equivalency `` between Hamas and Israel . `` On one side you have a terrorist group that congratulated itself on the Oct . 7 attack . . . and on the other side you have a democracy , Israel , that must respect international law while conducting a war it did not start , `` Sejourne said.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stood behind Israel , stating , & ldquo ; An attempt to show that the prime minister of Israel and the leader of terrorist organization are the same , and the involvement of international institution in this , is unacceptable , `` Tusk told a news conference.The United States ha been particularly vocal in it condemnation of the court , with US President Joe Biden calling Khan & rsquo ; s pursuit of warrant against Netanyahu and Gallant & ldquo ; outrageous . & rdquo ; The United States Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew called it & ldquo ; shameful & rdquo ; and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it & ldquo ; wrongheaded & rdquo ; and warned that it complicated effort to reach a hostage deal.He said he wa happy to work with Congress on an appropriate response.Some U.S . lawmaker called for the United States to impose sanction on the court . In 2020 , the United States imposed sanction on an ICC prosecutor.The Kremlin said on Tuesday it wa very curious that the United States appeared ready to use sanction against the ICC . `` In general , the situation is more than curious in term of the U.S . attitude and willingness to use sanction method even against the ICC , `` Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.In March last year , the ICC issued warrant for the arrest of President Vladimir Putin on war crime charges.Russia say the warrant against Putin is a meaningless attempt by the West to soil Russia 's reputation and denies war crime in Ukraine . Ukraine say Russia committed war crime . Russia say the West ha ignored Ukraine 's crime , a charge denied by Kyiv.Biden said last year that the ICC 's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Putin wa justified . The United States ha shared detail of alleged Russian war crime in Ukraine with the ICC.Russia is not a party to the Rome Statute , which established the ICC , so Moscow doe not recognize the court 's jurisdiction . `` We are not party to the relevant statute , therefore , we do not recognize the jurisdiction of the court , `` Peskov said.Reuters contributed to this report .","icc will target other democracy next , netanyahu warns"
2024-05-12 04:47:52.437,jpost,"Israel ha begun what look like a limited operation in Rafah , but seven month after October 7 , the parameter have not changed . Half the hostage have not returned , no alternative to Hamas ha been allowed to emerge in Gaza , Israel & rsquo ; s international standing ha collapsed , it relationship with the US is on the rock , the economy ha taken a hit , antisemitism is skyrocketing , and much of country is convinced the government is prolonging the crisis to stay in power . It & rsquo ; s clearly not great.Now imagine an alternative universe in which Israel wa led by a morally upstanding patriot who cared about the country & rsquo ; s reputation and the fate of Jews worldwide . Imagine that the prime minister understood the power of word to do good and of public diplomacy to persuade . And imagine & ndash ; why not ? & ndash ; that this wa Benjamin Netanyahu.Whether or not a limited hostage deal is somehow reached in the coming day , such a prime minister could flip the entire narrative dramatically at any moment by holding an English-language news conference aimed at the world and containing honest truth and easy-to-understand message with zero political scheming.For starter , he & rsquo ; d express deep regret over the loss of life in Gaza . & ldquo ; I know it ha been severe , although I am not inclined to believe Hamas number . We did our best with a situation in which Hamas us the population a a human fortification unlike any that history ha seen and seems to seek a much & lsquo ; martyrdom & rsquo ; a possible . Hamas is evil incarnate , and I weep for the Palestinians who are saddled with such maniacal ruler . & rdquo ; That part of the message should be beamed to every US college campus.He would make clear that Israel ha no desire to occupy Gaza and no intention of compelling the population to flee . & ldquo ; We are only there to remove the threat that attacked u on October 7 unprovoked , massacred over 1,200 people , and promised with great arrogance to do it again . & ldquo ; I ask every Palestinian : What would you have recommended that we do , at that point ? Wait for them , then , to do it again ? I & rsquo ; m genuinely curious . Is that what you would have done ? & rdquo ; A departure from cynicism and self-righteousness & nbsp ; The prime minister would say these last word without the kind of smirking , self-righteous cynicism we & rsquo ; ve come to expect . He would sound like a mensch , making each listener feel personally addressed . That & rsquo ; s because the prime minister is no fool and know that empathy begets empathy and sometimes even sympathy.THE PRIME MINISTER would , at this point , diverge not only from the style but from the content that ha characterized Netanyahu hitherto . He would say he is prepared to end the war right now in exchange for all remaining hostages.He would look into the camera and speak slowly word that will be replayed on every television station in the Arab world : & ldquo ; Dear Palestinians , dear people of Gaza : The war can end right now . This minute & ndash ; this very second . No more death and destruction . Life and reconstruction instead . It is the decision of Hamas . & rdquo ; He would make clear that Israel want to engage the world , the region , and the Palestinians in a day-after plan . And he would offer the Palestinians a choice & ndash ; after the hostage have all been released.One option would be for Israel to pull out of Gaza and let the chip fall where they may , which probably mean Hamas will remain in power despite it military degradation . & ldquo ; For u to do this , there is a major precondition . The group must commit itself to never again attack Israel from Gaza & ndash ; not with rocket , not with exploding balloon , and definitely not with an invasion by armed barbarian . This must be declared by the Political Bureau in document submitted to the Arab League . We understand it is unlikely , but we are giving you this choice . If you take it , then something good will have come of this war . I will sell this to the Israeli people . Let & rsquo ; s see you explain yourselves to the people of Gaza . & rdquo ; If Hamas is unwilling to do this & ndash ; and it is close to a certainty that it won & rsquo ; t & ndash ; then it would have a second option a well . The prime minister would explain that Israel would allow the entire leadership of the organization and anyone who participated in October 7 & ndash ; thousand of bloodthirsty fanatic and fool & ndash ; to leave the Strip in a flotilla guarded by the United States Navy and headed to whatever country agrees to take them . Turkey and Qatar are deserving candidate . Israel would undertake not to attack them there in the future a well.Here , the prime minister would finally address what Israel would like to see happen in the Strip the day after Hamas . He would jettison the self-defeating boycott of the Palestinian Authority , saying that the PA would be invited to return to Gaza , from which it wa expelled by Hamas in 2007 . He would add that Israel would be hoping that the PA revise the problematic school curriculum in which pupil are not educated for peace and that it would need to accept assistance , from Israel or from an Arab force , on security in the territory.He would add that Israel would , in exchange for acquiescence in these area , offer extremely significant financial aid to rebuild the Strip and set it on the road to a reasonable degree of prosperity.The prime minister would also mention the elephant in the room & ndash ; the world community & rsquo ; s desire to see a two-state solution in which the West Bank issue is also resolved . Repeating word Netanyahu and other Israeli leader have said in the past , the prime minister would explain that Israel doe not want to forever govern the Palestinians because it aim to be a democratic , Jewish-majority country . But he would add that there & rsquo ; s a catch . & ldquo ; What happened on October 7 make it impossible for u to remove the military completely from the West Bank because if that territory fell into the same hand that attacked u from Gaza , the damage would be many time greater . & ldquo ; For this , you have Hamas to blame . Every person who support Hamas support continuing a level of threat against u that doe not allow progress . Therefore , addressing the security danger & ndash ; which is a real danger for u , and not paranoia & ndash ; is the key . We will be working on this with all our partner , but we need some time . Let & rsquo ; s focus first on a real solution for Gaza . & rdquo ; He would conclude with a broader message that will resonate around the world : & ldquo ; Palestinian and Arab friend , and also enemy : We want peace , but we will not roll over . The Jewish people are in Israel to stay . Work with u and you will find a supporter and a champion . The past seven month have offered a glimpse of the hell that awaits u if the radical prevail . Let & rsquo ; s instead ensure that this never occurs again . & rdquo ; The prime minister will have not committed to anything that Israel should not itself desire & ndash ; but the deck will have been completely reshuffled . Even if Hamas reject all the option , among serious people in the world there will be clarity at last , and Israel would have international legitimacy to press on . This is good , because there is no great advantage in dwelling alone.I know & ndash ; the prime minister who doe this can not be Netanyahu . It really doe appear that basically nothing drive him but a lust for power and the most vulgar of political calculation . That & rsquo ; s why Israel need a new election with urgency . But I would love to be proved wrong.The writer is the former chief editor of The Associated Press in Europe , Africa and the Middle East , the former chairman of the Foreign Press Association in Jerusalem , and the author of two book about Israel .

2021-05-20 20:55:05.033,jpost,"& nbsp ; Even with over 3.1 million Twitter follower and a popular weekly television show , British-American late-night television comedian & nbsp ; John Oliver doe not run the world . Thank God . & nbsp ; Because if he did , or if he even ran a small country , Israel would be facing a humongous challenge on the international stage . & nbsp ; Oliver delivered a vicious 10-minute attack on Israel on his Last Week Tonight show on Sunday that wa a brutally unfair a it wa void of any context . To sum up his simplistic argument : Israel is hitting Hamas much harder than Hamas is hitting Israel , more Palestinians are dying than Jews , so Israel is wrong , immoral and guilty of war crime . & nbsp ; That & rsquo ; s the equivalent of saying that because an estimated 500,000 German civilian were killed in World War II , a opposed to & ldquo ; only & rdquo ; 67,000 British civilian , the Nazis were right in that war , and Britain wa wrong . & nbsp ; And Oliver is not alone . Other late-night comedian , such a Trevor Noah , have jumped into the fray with their pearl of geopolitical wisdom , a have various entertainer and celebrity . & nbsp ; What all that doe , in a world where social medium amplifies these voice well beyond what they deserve , is to create a sense among many Israelis that nobody understands u , that everyone is against u . And while the Olivers and Noahs are opinion influencers who have an oversized impact on a younger demographic that often get it view of the world from those type of TV show , the world & rsquo ; s government & ndash ; most importantly that of the US & ndash ; are not internalizing their drivel . At least not yet . & nbsp ; As the second full week of Operation Guardian of the Walls is nearing completion , it would be a mistake to look at Oliver & rsquo ; s and Noah & rsquo ; s rant , or the tweet of radical progressive US congresswoman Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar , or listen to the anti-Israel and often antisemitic chant at protest around the globe , and see that a representative of where Israel stand today in the world . & nbsp ; Those rant are bad , those tweet are infuriating , those chant are pernicious , but when it come to the world & rsquo ; s reaction to Israel & rsquo ; s campaign against Hamas & ndash ; meaning the reaction of government to Israel & rsquo ; s action & ndash ; Israel & rsquo ; s situation vis-a-vis the government of the world is better this time than it wa during any of the previous round of violence with Hamas in Gaza . & nbsp ; US President Joe Biden and many other leader around the world have given Israel the & ldquo ; critical time we needed & rdquo ; to carry out this operation , former National Security Council head Yaakov Amidror said . & nbsp ; Biden , who ha come under pressure from within his own party , primarily from the progressive wing , to take a more active role and demand an immediate ceasefire , said on Wednesday during a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he supported a ceasefire . Twenty-four hour later , in another call with Netanyahu , he said he & ldquo ; expected to see a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; This wa after nine day of giving unstinting support to Israel for it right to defend itself , and blocking three different UN Security Council statement calling for an immediate halt to the fighting without mentioning Hamas or the rocket from Gaza . & nbsp ; Some have characterized Biden & rsquo ; s call that he expects a de-escalation a US pressure , others that it portends an imminent crisis in tie between the two leader and the two country . Amidror caution against hyperbole . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think there is pressure , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; I think that what the Americans are saying is that they want to see a ceasefire . But that is not pressure . They understand the need for Israel to complete the operation , they understand we are talking about a terrorist organization that crossed all redlines , opened fire on Israeli city . Therefore the administration gave u time . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I MAKE no pretense of understanding how America work , & rdquo ; said Amidror , a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security . & ldquo ; I look at what they have done , and what they have done up until now is to give u the time we needed . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror said he wa not surprised by this , since the leadership in the Democratic Party & ndash ; & ldquo ; contrary to the perception here & rdquo ; & ndash ; still maintains & ldquo ; check and balance over the radical progressive element within the party that sometimes contains antisemitic element . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; What is ironic about Biden & rsquo ; s support is that it ha disappointed some on the Right , because it disrupts their narrative that Biden is a reincarnation of Barack Obama who will squeeze Israel at the first opportunity , and at the same time ha also disappointed some on the Left who would like to see much less support for Israel . & nbsp ; There are also Israeli domestic agenda at work among those who want to characterize Biden & rsquo ; s comment a & ldquo ; pressure . & rdquo ; Those politically opposed to Netanyahu would like to cast him now in the role a someone on a collision course with Biden and his administration , while the prime minister & rsquo ; s supporter are keen on painting a picture of perfect harmony between the two men who have known each other for nearly 40 year . & nbsp ; But there are objective standard against which to judge pressure to withdraw . Here & rsquo ; s one : In April 2002 , just nine day into Israel & rsquo ; s Operation Protective Shield aimed at crushing the terrorist infrastructure in the West Bank that wa responsible for hundred of death during the Second Intifada , president George W . Bush called on prime minister Ariel Sharon to withdraw IDF troop immediately from the Palestinian city they had moved into . & nbsp ; At a press conference in Crawford , Texas , Bush said , & ldquo ; My word to Israel are the same today a they were a couple of day ago : Withdraw without delay . & rdquo ; He added that he expected Israel to & ldquo ; heed my advice . & rdquo ; Sharon didn & rsquo ; t , the military campaign went on for another month , and US-Israel tie survived . & nbsp ; Biden & rsquo ; s expectation of de-escalation and support for a ceasefire doe not come near that Bush standard of rhetorical pressure . & nbsp ; AVIV SHIRON , a recently retired diplomat who previously served stint a Israel & rsquo ; s ambassador to the Netherlands , Austria and Switzerland , said that in comparison with other round of violence in Gaza in the past , & ldquo ; the international pressure this time is less significant and massive . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We have seen the new US president give full support to Israel & rsquo ; s right to defend itself , and did not demand an immediate ceasefire . Now he is calling for a ceasefire , but we are 11 day into the operation & ndash ; that is very significant . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Also inside the European Union , which is always more critical , there were more country this time that supported Israel & rsquo ; s right to defend itself , and did not demand a ceasefire . & rdquo ; He also pointed out that Israeli flag were flown atop government building in Germany , Austria , the Czech Republic and Slovenia a a sign of solidarity . & nbsp ; Shiron attributed this primarily to the fewer civilian casualty in Gaza than in the past . & ldquo ; The collateral damage is less , and we are seeing fewer picture of dead and injured and child , even though there are always civilian casualty . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The number of casualty in Gaza is less because the IDF and the air force have learned lesson from the past , and a a result pressure coming from various government is less , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; Shiron maintained that anti-Israel protest on the street of London , Paris , Berlin and Washington always accompany this type of conflict , and that there is little difference in them this time around . As they continue , there will be more pressure on various government to speak out and take a stand , but & ldquo ; all in all thing are better than in previous time . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Hamas took advantage of existing tension in Jerusalem a it pretense for launching attack , and started the current campaign by firing at Jerusalem & ndash ; an act that succeeded in both playing on and building up passion of Muslims around the world , including among Israeli-Arabs , something Hamas certainly deems a & ldquo ; success . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; At the same time , however , Shiron said that firing on Jerusalem hurt Hamas in capital around the world . & ldquo ; When you fire on Jerusalem , a opposed to Sderot , it is perceived differently in the world . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror , who agreed with Shiron that Europe ha largely given more support for Israel than in the past and allowed it to carry out it operation according to it own timeline , said there were three main reason for this degree of understanding among many world government . & nbsp ; First , he said , wa Israeli restraint over incident from Gaza in the week before Hamas fired rocket toward Jerusalem on May 10 . Second , is that it is clear to the government around the world who started the conflagration . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; And the third thing is that they are shooting at civilian target , while everyone understands we are shooting at military one , & rdquo ; Amidror said . & ldquo ; Sometimes we err and civilian are killed , but our intent & ndash ; and the direction of our fire & ndash ; is toward military target , while they are shooting at civilian from among civilian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror said that even those critical of recent Israeli action in Jerusalem , such a effort to evict four family from Sheikh Jarrah and police activity during Ramadan at the Damascus Gate , understand that there are huge gap between the claim of Israeli error in this matter and the response . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; There is disproportionality between the claim against u , and the reaction . For the sake of argument , let & rsquo ; s say that they were right , that our behavior could have been gentler in Jerusalem . Does that justify rocket on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv ? There is tremendous disproportionality . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; But that disproportionality & ldquo ; play into our hand , & rdquo ; Amidror said , a & ldquo ; reasonable people understand that a terrorist organization took advantage of the situation to fire on civilian . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; While Amidror maintained that the reaction of much of the world overall ha not been overly bad , including Russia , China is an exception . There the overseas channel of state broadcaster CCTV aired a report shot-full with antisemitic trope . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; . . . . Some people believe that US pro-Israeli policy is traceable to the influence of wealthy Jews in the US and the Jewish lobby on US foreign policy-makers , & rdquo ; said host Zheng Junfeng , asking his audience whether US support for Israel wa truly based on shared value . & ldquo ; Jews dominate finance and Internet sector . So do they have the powerful lobby some say ? Possible . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror took umbrage . & ldquo ; There is a big difference between being for a ceasefire and antisemitic claim , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; As someone who very much value the relationship with China , it pain me to see antisemitic claim in China compete with the antisemitic argument of [ Turkish President Recep Tayyip ] Erdogan . This is beneath China . & rdquo ;","amid gaza conflict , global response to israel not a bad a on tv"
2020-11-22 21:17:40.527,jpost,"Two rocket were fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip , one week apart from each other . While the IDF shrugged off the first , blaming it on bad weather , it & rsquo ; s now clear . It wa not a mistake . It wa a message . Hamas is under pressure , and it & rsquo ; s getting worse . The coronavirus pandemic is wreaking havoc in the blockaded enclave , and Hamas & ndash ; which is in no mood for conflict with Israel & ndash ; tends to send message in the form of incendiary balloon or rocket when it is under pressure and need aid . Though the group wa able to effectively deal with the deadly virus during the first wave , the blockaded coastal enclave is suffering from a harsh second wave of the coronavirus , with more than 5,517 total case and 65 death , the majority since September . The Strip & rsquo ; s weak healthcare infrastructure , with fewer than 3,000 bed , is unable to cope with all the sick , and is also seeing a record number of daily new case & ndash ; on Saturday alone the Health Ministry said there were 891 new case . Fathi Abu Warda , adviser to the Palestinian health minister in Gaza , wa quoted by Wafa news agency a saying on Sunday that there wa an & ldquo ; unprecedented hike & rdquo ; in the number of case and that the European Hospital in Khan Yunis in the south of the Gaza Strip ha reached it limit in receiving coronavirus case . Thanks to the international aid Israel ha let into the Strip , Hamas ha been able to increase it testing capability from 200 a day during the first wave to 3,500 a day , and the number of ventilator ha risen to 160 . Abu Warda also said two truckloads of & ldquo ; urgent medical aid , & rdquo ; including respirator and medication for those with chronic illness , will enter the Strip in the coming day . But it & rsquo ; s still not enough . In addition to the coronavirus crisis , the economy is still a disaster & ndash ; with the unemployment rate in Gaza close to 50 % , with those who are employed earning close to nothing . The average monthly income ha fallen from $ 244 to $ 29 since March . Israel & rsquo ; s defense establishment and Southern Command have warned several time that there is a direct link between a worsening economy and rocket fire or incendiary balloon . Hamas is also becoming further isolated , including from the Palestinian Authority , which recently resumed security cooperation with Israel following the victory of US President-elect Joe Biden . Following the resumption of security tie , Palestinian security force in the West Bank are expected to renew their arrest of Hamas operative in the territory . The normalization of tie between Israel and Gulf state ha also placed a strain on Hamas . And that , the IDF fear , will lead to closer tie with Israel & rsquo ; s enemy on it northern border & ndash ; Hezbollah . Already following the deal with the United Arab Emirates , Ismail Haniyeh , who head Hamas & rsquo ; s political bureau , met with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut . There have been more than a dozen round of violent clash between the IDF and terror group since 2018 , with thousand of rocket fired toward Israel and thousand of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad target struck by the Israel Air Force in retaliation . But all of them ended without any tangible solution , leading the IDF to change it concept toward a new approach , called & ldquo ; Southern Wind , & rdquo ; which would use higher-quality intelligence and firepower to shorten the length of an operation . A new concept is all fine and dandy , but when push come to shove and a large-scale military operation take place , neither side will end up a a winner . You just have to look at the recent history of the military operation in the Gaza Strip where nothing changed , except that both side experienced more death and destruction . So why did the IDF echo Hamas & rsquo ; s lightning excuse when two rocket were fired toward central Israel ? Neither side want a large-scale military operation , and the IDF belief that Yahya Sinwar , Hamas & rsquo ; s leader in the Strip , a well a the head of it military wing , Mohammed Deif , still prefer to follow the status quo and avoid confrontation with the IDF . The rocket fired by Hamas are a message sent by Sinwar , a message that ha been received and understood by Israel before . The pressure is rising and something need to be done before the situation explodes . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ;","it wasn @ @ @ t lightning silly , the rocket were a message by hamas - analysis"
2023-08-01 18:05:08.050,jpost,"The armed wing of Hamas , Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades , published on Tuesday a dog tag it claimed it member snatched from an IDF soldier during the 2014 Operation Protective Edge with Israel.The group did not provide further detail about the dog tag , which carried the name of the Givati Brigade . & ldquo ; We won & rsquo ; t talk much about this tag ; the command of the enemy & rsquo ; s army know well who this tag belongs to , & rdquo ; the group said . & nbsp ; The publication of the dog tag came on the ninth anniversary of the abduction of IDF soldier Hadar Goldin during the operation .

The terrorist did not address the kidnapping of Goldin.Hamas also re-published photo it claim show Goldin 's Tavor rifle on Tuesday . The photo were first published by the terrorist movement in December.At the time of the release of the photo in December , the leader of the Hamas movement in Gaza , Yahya Sinwar , stated during a ceremony that Hamas ha been holding & ldquo ; secret negotiation & rdquo ; with Israel concerning the captive it holding in Gaza.The terrorist movement is demanding the release of all prisoner rearrested after being released in the Shalit deal and all female , minor , sick and elderly prisoner , a well any body being held by Israel , according to Sinwar . & ldquo ; We will give the occupation a limited time to complete this deal , otherwise we will close the file of the four soldier forever , and we will find another way to liberate our prisoner , God willing , & rdquo ; said Sinwar at the time . Mengistu and al-Sayed are both civilian , but Hamas refers to them a soldiers.Goldin family continues campaign for the return of the captivesLast month , Goldin 's family protested against government representative at a memorial ceremony for Operation Protective Edge , with Goldin 's mother , Leah , stating she would immolate herself if that 's what it would take to bring her son 's body home . `` [ Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu , [ Benny ] Gantz , [ Defense Minister Yoav ] Gallant , [ IDF Chief of Staff ] Herzi [ Halevi ] , what do you want ? Do you want me to immolate myself ? No problem . I 'll immolate myself like Itzik Saidan . That 's what opened your eye to deal with wounded veteran , so it 's about time that you open your eye to deal with the captive and their family . I have no problem immolating myself , I just need to choose the right time and place . Is that the only way you 'll understand ? Is this your language ? It doe n't scare me , `` said Leah Goldin ahead of the ceremony.As Netanyahu left the ceremony , Ayelet Goldin , Hadar 's sister , shouted toward him `` Benjamin Netanyahu , look a bereaved sister in the eye .

2021-05-20 21:05:11.230,jpost,"& nbsp ; Delegates to the 16th Socialist International were milling about the Montechoro Hotel & rsquo ; s lobby in Albufeira , a sleepy resort town off of Portugal & rsquo ; s Algarve coast , when a gunman nailed five bullet into Palestinian cardiologist Isam Sartawi & rsquo ; s chest and head . & nbsp ; The assassin vanished under a hail of police bullet . His target , the first PLO leader to advocate recognition of Israel , and also to openly hold talk with Israelis , wa soon pronounced dead , along with his message . & nbsp ; Sartawi & rsquo ; s Israeli interlocutor came from the thick Left , people like Maj . - Gen . ( re . ) Matti Peled and former Labor Party secretary-general Arieh Eliav , but when shot he wa but one wall away from Shimon Peres , who would become prime minister the following year . & nbsp ; Rumors of a planned meeting between the two were probably unfounded , but to the assailant & ndash ; the Abu-Nidal terrorist group & ndash ; that didn & rsquo ; t matter ; Sartawi spoke peace , and that made him anathema and his death foretold . & nbsp ; It wa part of a pattern , one that neither began nor ended on that sorry day in April 1983 , and in fact lace Israel & rsquo ; s history almost from it birth to these very day of awe ; day which make many assume fatalistically that peace-killers will always defeat the peacemaker . Well they haven & rsquo ; t , and they won & rsquo ; t . & nbsp ; THE FIRST of the peacemaker to fall in the line of duty wa Jordan & rsquo ; s King Abdullah , who wa shot in 1951 at the Mosque of Omar & rsquo ; s entrance after holding secret talk with David Ben-Gurion & rsquo ; s emissary . & nbsp ; Two year before Sartawi & rsquo ; s murder , Anwar Sadat wa mowed down by four Islamist gunman who emerged from a truck during a military parade and emptied their Kalashnikovs at the presidential podium killing , besides Sadat , another 10 men . The young peace treaty with Israel , though only part of a broader Islamist agenda , wa a key element in the squad & rsquo ; s motivation . & nbsp ; The following year Lebanese president-elect Bashir Gemayel , who had been dialoguing with Israel for a while and wa widely expected to make peace with Menachem Begin , wa blown up along with 26 others during a political meeting in Beirut . The assassin , widely believed to have been activated by Syrian agent , cited the alliance with Israel a the cause of his act . & nbsp ; The common denominator among all these assault is the belief that Arab-Jewish peace , no matter how limited or embryonic , is an abomination that must be nipped in the bud . & nbsp ; Now this history is once again at play ; not in Hamas & rsquo ; s quest to fight & ndash ; that & rsquo ; s a given that need no pretext & ndash ; but in it timing . Hamas could have started this round of violence long before or well after this month . What made it press the trigger wa Israel & rsquo ; s first-ever Arab-Jewish coalition agreement , which wa but several day away from being signed . & nbsp ; The extraordinary Bennett-Abbas-Lapid government wa set to inspire a great Arab-Jewish reconciliation , a prospect that from the viewpoint of Hamas wa intolerable . Like Sartawi & rsquo ; s evolving dialogue and like Gemayel & rsquo ; s burgeoning peace & ndash ; it had to be preempted . Hence the rush , scope , and total abandonment of measure with which Hamas unleashed it wrath . & nbsp ; Time will tell to what extent the fighting & rsquo ; s spillover to Israel & rsquo ; s mixed town wa micromanaged by Hamas operative . However , it is clear already now that the rampage in Lod , Acre and Jaffa served Hamas well , and that whether or not they were conducted from Gaza they were clearly incited from there . & nbsp ; Worse , in term of it immediate aim the ploy worked . The breathtaking move Naftali Bennett had already introduced with the inspiring statement that & ldquo ; a broad government is not a default , it & rsquo ; s an aim , & rdquo ; wa summarily shelved . & nbsp ; Like that peace with Lebanon & rsquo ; s elected president which Israel wa already touching and smelling only to see him and his gospel murdered , the great reconciliation that Bennett and Mansour Abbas seemed ready to launch wa trampled , overnight , by thug who lynched pedestrian , shattered storefront , and torched synagogue . & nbsp ; The question this plunge from utopia to dystopia raise is therefore this : Can peace survive it murder ? & nbsp ; STRATEGIC SURPRISES are good at what they announce & ndash ; surprise & ndash ; but their planner often fail to plan for what their surprise uncork . & nbsp ; Hitler & rsquo ; s invasion of the Soviet Union , Japan & rsquo ; s attack on Pearl Harbor and Egypt & rsquo ; s crossing of the Suez Canal were stunning . All three , however , were ultimately defeated . Hamas & rsquo ; s strategic surprise is headed the same way . & nbsp ; The Germans disparaged the Russians & rsquo ; industrial ability , the Japanese underestimated America & rsquo ; s fighting spirit , the Egyptians didn & rsquo ; t calculate Israeli improvisation , and Hamas doesn & rsquo ; t understand what the sight of a torched synagogue doe to a Jew , any Jew , even a leftist , an agnostic or a convert . & nbsp ; On this front the counterattack is already underway , with hundred of arrest that will be followed by harsh indictment that will produce lengthy jail term . & nbsp ; Equally swift will be the physical restoration that the peace-murderers & rsquo ; carnage demand . It will take month , but every ruined synagogue , hotel , restaurant and shop will be repaired , a will all the vandalized park , playground , plaza and bus stop , not to mention ransacked police station . & nbsp ; Much more difficult will be the rehabilitation of the surprise attack & rsquo ; s big target : communal relation that were built over generation . & nbsp ; Yes , the struggle ahead of u is daunting , the civic version of defending Stalingrad and wresting Iwo Jima , but like those battle , it will end in evil & rsquo ; s defeat . & nbsp ; Anwar Sadat wa murdered , but the peace he struck survived him , and life to this day . & nbsp ; Mansour Abbas & rsquo ; s emergence in an Israeli coalition ha apparently been derailed , but he still showed up at the burnt Beit Yisrael Synagogue and , with Lod Mayor Yair Revivo ( Likud ) alongside him , denounced the arson a anti-Islamic and vowed to participate in it reconstruction . & nbsp ; Yes , the Arab-Jewish coalition which Middle Israelis crave , the situation begs , and nearly half the Arab electorate endorsed & ndash ; is dead . Its spirit , however , life on . & nbsp ; www.MiddleIsrael.net Amotz Asa-El & rsquo ; s bestselling Mitzad Ha & rsquo ; ivelet Ha & rsquo ; yehudi ( The Jewish March of Folly , Yediot Sefarim , 2019 ) , is a revisionist history of the Jewish people & rsquo ; s leadership from antiquity to modernity",can arab-jewish peace survive the ongoing violence in israel ?

Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have so far lobbed nearly 4,000 rocket from Gaza into Israeli territory in less than two week . Israel & rsquo ; s Iron Dome missile defense system ha successfully managed to intercept the majority of these in midair . & nbsp ; Nevertheless , 12 Israelis have been killed and hundred more injured . & nbsp ; On the Palestinian side , some 219 people have been killed in the ongoing flare-up , according to Gaza & rsquo ; s health ministry . Of those , Israel ha said that at least 150 were combatant . & nbsp ; According to Dr . Harel Chorev , an expert on Palestinian affair and head of the Network Analysis Desk at Tel Aviv University & rsquo ; s Moshe Dayan Center , Hamas ha suffered significant loss during this round of fighting . & ldquo ; Hamas lost in every strategic calculation : Many of their tunnel in the Strip are destroyed and their maritime force are also paralyzed , & rdquo ; Chorev told The Media Line . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Since the damage is very high , this will be a lesson that Hamas will take into account . Unlike in 2014 [ during ] Operation Protective Edge , they were not ready . & rdquo ; Israel pummelled a network of underground tunnel in the Palestinian enclave that were being used to hide rocket and launcher . IDF spokesperson Brig . Gen . Hadai Zilberman on Wednesday said that Israeli Air Force plane had targeted 15 km ( roughly 9 mile ) of tunnel , dropping 122 bomb on the southern Gaza Strip overnight on Tuesday . & nbsp ; When Hamas initially began launching rocket into Israel last week , they mistakenly believed that the fighting would only last a day or two , Chorev said . & ldquo ; It will be very hard for them to recover their underground infrastructure , & rdquo ; he stated . & ldquo ; They thought that it would be inconvenient for [ Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin ] Netanyahu to attack now , which is quite the opposite . It wa quite good for him , politically . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Hamas & rsquo ; ongoing strategy , he added , relies on a combination of guerrilla tactic and more traditional military weaponry like rocket and mortar . While Israel ha been mostly successful at countering the group & rsquo ; s rocket and ha efficiently targeted fighter in Gaza without needing to send in ground force , Hamas ha also notched a few surprising victory of it own . Namely , in helping to stoke the division between Arab and Jewish Israelis across Israel . The rioting and unrest recently seen in several town and city , Chorev argued , & ldquo ; is the main asset of Hamas and they are totally surprised by it and trying to inflame [ the situation ] more and more . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Islamist group , which run the Gaza Strip , ha also managed to score a few point in other key strategic area , including undermining the Palestinian Authority , which recently called off general election in the West Bank . In addition , they succeeded in putting the international spotlight on the Palestinian issue .

2024-04-05 19:41:43.227,jpost,"Chen Peiper , born in the Netherlands , is an esteemed Israeli jewelry designer and teacher , and over the last two decade ha been a glass sculptor . As an artist , she is very sensitive to and perceptive of the surrounding realities.In her career , Peiper & rsquo ; s work have been on show at numerous solo and group exhibition in Israel ( in 2023 at the Tel Aviv Bienniale of Crafts and Design at the Eretz Israel Museum ) , The United States , and Europe.She work with different technique , using material such a gold , silver , stainless steel , aluminum , and copper . When designing sculpture , she combine glass with metal.Her work reflect her personal experience ( a in her solo show & ldquo ; Fish Plus & rdquo ; in 2020 ) and social exposure.In 2022 , Peiper participated in the Venice Art Bienniale , presenting Covitrum & ndash ; 18 glass anonymous face in various mask worn during the pandemic . There , she also showed the powerful Refugees , dedicating it to the African emigrant . & nbsp ; The artist & rsquo ; s latest work , New Life , is centered on the motif of Israeli flag , which express Peiper & rsquo ; s deep concern for the situation in Israel , during last year & rsquo ; s protest and the ongoing war.In an interview with the Magazine , Peiper said that she made aliyah during the Yom Kippur War , and she shared her memory from that crucial-for-Israel time . This wa in 1973 , when Peiper wa nearly 27 year old , and the State of Israel wa only 25 . Almost a peer , they grew up together.Before we move on to your current work , a a sea lover I must ask you about your solo exhibition from 2020 about the underwater world , & lsquo ; Fish Plus . & rsquo ; Why fish ? It & rsquo ; s related to my childhood in Holland . My parent used to have a summer house by the sea , and I wa always on the water : in a sailboat , a rowboat ; I wa very sporty , and the water wa very important to me . I wa living in it . So I made sculpture of what I remembered.But also one of the sculpture wa inspired by a drawing of my grandson , which he made when he wa six year old . All the sculpture were in the fusing technique ; I used transparent and hand-painted glass , combined with silver , copper , and iron . & nbsp ; A magical experience for the viewer and a nostalgic trip into your past . Speaking of your past , when we first met , in December , you said that you moved to Israel 50 year ago & hellip ; Yes , in 1973 , in the middle of the [ Yom Kippur ] War . I made aliyah at the age of 26 , almost 27 . I wa already after my jewelry design study at Rietveld Academy of Art , in Amsterdam . I had been already working . We ( my husband and our one-year-old daughter , Tamar ) were already on our way to Israel when the war started.Were you on the plane ? No , my husband said that the plane went too quickly , and he wanted u to have an adventure , so we went on a cruise , on a ship to Israel . We started it from the south of France . Just a we were about to begin our trip , some people told u there wa a war in Israel . Then , we wanted to make aliyah even faster.The war didn & rsquo ; t stop you from this move ? No , when you want to live in a country , a war is not a reason to go away . You stay here ; you don & rsquo ; t leave the country because of a war.And why did you want to make aliyah in the first place ? My husband is Israeli , born in Tel Aviv . He ha lived in Holland for 10 year , and we met at the Academy of Art . We could have stayed in Holland , but it wa clear to u that we could not live in both country , and we decided that we wanted to live in Israel . & nbsp ; Following this decision , you arrived in the middle of the Yom Kippur War . . . It happened like that . We moved in with Gidi & rsquo ; s , my husband & rsquo ; s , parent in Ramat Hasharon , which made thing much easier . & nbsp ; How wa Israel back then ? How do you remember Israel during the Yom Kippur War ? Cities without men . Tel Aviv , Hod Hasharon , completely without men . For a few month , it wa like that . Life wa quieter . There wa nobody on the street . It wa a real war for u in the center of Israel . Now during the war people continue their life , shop are open , and people are sitting at coffee shop ; back then , the street were empty . But also the street looked different . Now everything is modern ; in 1973 there were cloud of sand on the road of Ramat Hasharon.And how different wa the society of Israel back then in comparison to today & rsquo ; s ? It & rsquo ; s hard for me to say . I jumped into the group of Gidi & rsquo ; s friend . They all were in the army and all talked about the army , so it wa difficult . And they were shy to speak in English to me at that time.But in general , you could have visited a friend or a neighbor anytime . Now you must call or text to set up a visit . [ Back then , ] the door to the apartment were always open . & nbsp ; From what you are saying , it sound like people were closer to each other . As we speak , I & rsquo ; ve just realized that you and the State of Israel are almost the same age . Since 1973 , the very young state of 25 year and you , almost 27 year old , a peer you grew up together.I have never thought of this , but this is true , yes . [ She laugh . ] And after the Yom Kippur War , how do you recall Israel ? We all worked very hard . We wanted to build something , and we felt we did . & nbsp ; Do you mean your life or also Israel ? Also Israel . & nbsp ; So after the war , you started to work in your profession , a a jewelry designer ? Yes , at home . People have come especially to me . I looked at how a person behaved and what he [ or she ] liked , and based on that I wa designing . & nbsp ; Before shifting to glass sculpture ( which is your main focus right now ) , for 40 year you were creating jewelry , showing it at professional exhibition in the Netherlands , Israel , and the US , and you were also teaching how to design . & nbsp ; Yes , I taught design at a technology center for jewelry in Tel Aviv ( 1985-1995 ) , and in 1993 at a special program for Bedouin girl and young woman who were making traditional Bedouin jewelry but wanted to learn about other approach ; and ( in the year 1990-2000 ) at Beit Berl art college in Ramat Hasharon , where I wa head of the jewelry department . & nbsp ; So you had an established professional position , and suddenly in 2002 you went to Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design to study glass design . What triggered that ? I wa looking , for a long time , for something else . I hoped that if I had another material , it would be more interesting for me and more creative.My husband , who ha been always very supportive of me , saw in a newspaper that there wa an opening of a new department of glass , a a second degree , at Bezalel . I applied and got accepted.It wa two year of hard work , but it wa very interesting to me to learn various technique of working with glass . It wa wonderful , in the middle of my life to start with a new material ! But I have never forgotten about my metal . The metal always help me to design the inside of the glass . It add the feeling . I have combined it with glass.What attracts you to glass ? It can be transparent and doesn & rsquo ; t have to . You can do everything with it , move it in all the direction you want to . Another thing , jewelry is also art , but when you create in gold it is [ displayed ] in a glass box ; people can & rsquo ; t touch it . And I like it when people can touch a sculpture . & nbsp ; It change the experience of the viewer . With your art you reflect on your personal experience , but also on group and social exposure , such a war , the issue of African refugee , or the pandemic . In 2022 , at the Venice Art Bienniale , you showed [ the installation ] Covitrum ( COVID and vitro , & lsquo ; glass & rsquo ; in Latin ) , a series of glass sculpture & ndash ; unrecognizable portrait , without distinction in gender or skin color . These face were covered with different mask worn during the pandemic.Yes , the only distinction wa that I made 13 adult and five child ( representing my five grandchild ) , together 18 . I chose this number because of it gematria ; the number 18 mean chai & ndash ; & lsquo ; life , & rsquo ; in Hebrew . & nbsp ; Why did you want to incorporate a number important in Judaism , in a way taking away from the universality of this project ? It wa very important to me because it is a very powerful number . Each head wa covered with a different mask . In these mask I put the story . A mask is a tool of pretense and protection , and it allows introspection . It give a space to reveal or hide the identity and feeling . One of them wa transparent , and I called it & lsquo ; Read my lip . & rsquo ; But there wa also the Israeli flag , the Venice flag , and a rainbow LGBTQ flag mask . & nbsp ; On view in Italy , there wa also your sculpture Refugees , dedicated to people who fled their country across the sea in inhuman condition . A huge unresolved issue of African emigrant often losing their life on the way to Europe wa expressed in your powerful sculpture.I wanted to show the color of the sky and the sea and , in between , human being . The sea wa their last refuge . They were mostly Black people , so I used the color black and red ( a blood ) . You can see that they are all on the boat , but one is outside & ndash ; didn & rsquo ; t make it . & nbsp ; You responded to this tragic reality with extreme sensitivity . Your latest sculpture are also very socially engaged . In December 2023 , at a group exhibition & lsquo ; The Colors of Camouflage , & rsquo ; at the Periscope Gallery in Tel Aviv , you presented two series of work : & lsquo ; Upside Down , & rsquo ; in camouflage military color , and & lsquo ; New Life , & rsquo ; with motif of Israeli flag in glass , flowing in different shape . In both case , you & rsquo ; ve connected a very smooth and elegant movement of glass attached to very simple and basic metal food can . What wa the idea behind this concept ? And did you make this series of sculpture before the war or during the current war ? I started before the war . During the war , my feeling about it were even stronger . I am very connected to my grandson , what they do.Do they serve in the army now ? Yes , three of them . I am very proud of them . & nbsp ; So the color came from your grandson ? Yes , although not directly . I wa worried , in general . The flag , at first , were connected to the last year & rsquo ; s demonstration in Israel . I wanted to show the sadness of thousand of people being with a flag during the protest . I wa concerned about what would be with this country and what wa going on . I am still , I am worried.What do think will be with Israel ? & nbsp ; The future will not be easy . But I think that we are very strong , and we have to be very strong . & nbsp ; We are talking after many month of war , and you are wearing a & lsquo ; Bring Them Home & rsquo ; necklace [ in solidarity with the hostage ] , and you are still saying that we are very strong ? This is a very scary and ugly fairy tale . But , of course , we are very strong ! Otherwise , we & ndash ; you and me & ndash ; would not be here today.So how do you see the future of Israel now , also with the new wave of antisemitism around the world ? When I listen to my daughter , Tamar and Dafna , they are worried . When I listen to my grandson , they are full of life and they believe that everything will be fine . & nbsp ; Why did you connect flag with simple can ? They are real can , reused . By adding a flag to them , there is something new , and maybe there will be something new in the region , not the same a it wa before.Whatever happens in Israel , I express it in my art , both my jewelry and glass sculpture . But the first reason why I used the can wa practical & ndash ; the metal [ material ] and it form . Then I realized that I could use different shape of can , which gave me new feelings.When I saw these sculpture at the exhibition , looking at the Israeli flag made of glass , I thought that this wa Zionist art . Is it okay to call your art Zionist ? I am very pleased to hear it ! Do you think there is a place for something like Zionist art , that the Israeli artist will want to go in this direction ? This is interesting , what you are asking . When I look back at the exhibition ( and this is very important , to look back and check with yourself what you did ) , I ask myself if it wa only the obsession of flag . But it wasn & rsquo ; t . In every piece , I put my feeling inside . & nbsp ; How would you name these feeling ? New life . ■ On April 18 at 7 p.m . , at Beit Yad LaBanim cultural center , 2 Hamahteret Street , Ramat Hasharon , a group show will open which will include one of Peiper & rsquo ; s new work , View of Israel . & nbsp ; The artist & rsquo ; s website : chenpeiper2.wixsite.com/chen",the flag in focus : zionist art

So we are waiting . I want the Passover vacation to be like it should be where I can enjoy it with friend . & rdquo ; The rocket fired from Gaza followed tension in Jerusalem , a dozen of Palestinian rioter were injured and hundred arrested following violent clash with police on the Temple Mount.The sound of siren ha been so much a part of Kohn & rsquo ; s life that she didn & rsquo ; t know if she could really use the word & ldquo ; fear & rdquo ; to describe how she felt when she heard the red alert phone application beep , when a rocket wa launched at her kibbutz just a she wa sitting down to dinner with her family at her grandparent & rsquo ; home at around 8:30 p.m . & ldquo ; We heard the red alert for Kissufim , and at first didn & rsquo ; t understand what wa happening , & rdquo ; said Kohn . & ldquo ; Then we heard a loud boom and ran to the bomb shelter in the house . & rdquo ; The whole family had gathered for dinner , 16 people altogether . & ldquo ; We let my grandmother go in first so she could sit down , and then we the grandchild went in . & rdquo ; The rocket wa intercepted by the Iron Dome missile-defense system . There were no report of injuries.After the all-clear , they returned to the dinner table . At night they closed the metal window on the bomb shelter , which is also Libi & rsquo ; s bedroom , and made sure there wa a clear path to the room in case the family needed to reach it in the middle of the night . & ldquo ; I want the government to create a situation where we don & rsquo ; t have to pay for the situation every Passover , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; We want the government to make u feel safe so we don & rsquo ; t have to pack a suitcase all the time and run . I don & rsquo ; t know how they should do that , but the nation voted for them and it is time that they do that . & rdquo ; There are no magical solution to the situation , said Libi & rsquo ; s mother , Meirav , 49 , who wa born in Ein Hashlosha . & ldquo ; You never know when or where it will come , but we understand that with everything that is happening in Jerusalem , we will end up paying the price , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; When the security situation heat up , it will end up reaching Gaza . & rdquo ; FOR THE most part , the Kohns enjoy a quality of life that make up for the occasional missile they have to contend with . & ldquo ; I am sure this is where I want my kid to grow up , even if sometimes we have these & rdquo ; attack , said Meirav.But the government should reach a comprehensive solution once and for all , she said , even if that mean an initial military operation to get both side to the negotiating table.Almost 4,400 rocket were fired at Israel from Gaza in May & rsquo ; s 11-day war , Operation Guardians of the Wall , in which 256 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed . In 2014 , Operation Protective Edge lasted six week and some 2,100 Palestinians were killed , including 1,462 civilian . Sixty-six Israeli soldier and seven Israeli citizen were also killed . Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 left 167 Palestinians , including 87 civilian , and two Israeli soldier and four civilian dead , according to B & rsquo ; Tselem . & ldquo ; It is obviously a very challenging situation for all the government , also for the last government , & rdquo ; Meirav said . & ldquo ; Before we reach a solution we need a serious military operation , but at the same time , if we keep doing the same thing all the time , nothing will change . I do expect the government to be ready after the next war for the day after , and to come with clear goal and to sit and talk and come to an agreement for the last time & ndash ; not to just come , reach a ceasefire agreement , and then go home . & rdquo ; Sirens were also activated on Sunday afternoon in Nahal Oz . The IDF later said they were false alarms.However , 67-year-old Adele Raemer , who ha lived on Kibbutz Nirim since 1975 , said Israeli resident living along the Gaza border know there is no such thing a a false alarm . & ldquo ; A false alarm mean something wa shot at u from Gaza and didn & rsquo ; t reach the border , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; So two day ago after the & lsquo ; false alarm , & rsquo ; we knew something could happen . We have been getting rocket since 2006 . This is not something anybody get used to but is something you learn to live with . Everyone is aware and ready . We know how to sense an escalation . & rdquo ; With Ramadan coinciding with Passover , and with Israeli Independence Day and Yom Hazikaron coming up , it can become a & ldquo ; prime time for terror , & rdquo ; she said.However , Raemer noted , most Gaza resident do not want an escalation now with an increase of work permit being issued by Israel and Egypt , sending expert to help them rebuild the infrastructure destroyed in last year & rsquo ; s war . & ldquo ; That is something they don & rsquo ; t want to lose , & rdquo ; she said.And while Islamic Jihad ha been held responsible for the latest rocket attack , it is Hamas that control Gaza and need to be accountable . & ldquo ; We are the strong one here , and I would really prefer that we don & rsquo ; t do thing that can be seen a inflammatory , & rdquo ; Raemer said . & ldquo ; I understand we want to say this is our land , and people have the right of freedom of expression , but we have to take responsibility for our action . & rdquo ; Raemer mentioned the planned flag march by the Im Tirzu NGO . & ldquo ; Going out on a march just to beat our chest can have an effect on the rest of our country , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; I hope people will keep their head on straight and not do something that will be inflammatory . & rdquo ;","for israeli living by gaza , life amid tension is 99 % heaven , 1 % hell"

2020-12-22 17:57:37.993,jpost,"Palestinian official on Tuesday expressed hope that a new Israeli general election will not disrupt Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas & rsquo ; s initiative to convene an international conference for peace in the Middle East early next year . The official , who were responding to news about the possibility that Israel may be headed toward it fourth election in March 2021 , also expressed hope that the vote would result in an end to the era of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . In October , Abbas sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Ant & oacute ; nio Guterres , urging him to hold pressing consultation in coordination with the Middle East Quartet ( US , UN , Russia and European Union ) and the UN Security Council on convening an international conference & ldquo ; with full power and with the participation of all concerned party . & rdquo ; The Palestinians believe the prospect of holding the proposed conference have grown after the victory of US President-elect Joe Biden in the US presidential election . & ldquo ; The purpose of the international conference is to revive the two-state solution after Netanyahu and [ outgoing US President Donald ] Trump did everything to destroy that option , & rdquo ; a Palestinian official told The Jerusalem Post . & ldquo ; We are confident that once Trump is out of the White House , we will go back to the two-state solution . We also hope that Israeli voter , when they go to cast their ballot , would understand that Netanyahu and his government are harming Israeli interest by rejecting the two-state solution . & rdquo ; However , the official said the Palestinians were concerned that new election in Israel would delay or divert attention from Abbas & rsquo ; s plan to hold an international peace conference . & ldquo ; If Netanyahu win again , we expect the Biden administration and the international conference to take real and serious measure to compel Israel to adhere to international resolution pertaining to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , especially Security Council Resolution 2334 , which call for an end to Israeli settlement activity , & rdquo ; the official said .

After applying to `` make aliyah , `` Sharansky wa arrested on charge of treason and espionage . He wa convicted in a Soviet court and served nine year in the Gulag . Following massive public campaign by the State of Israel , world Jewry and leader of the free world , Sharansky wa released in 1986 , and emigrated to Israel , on the very day of his release.In his first year in Israel , Sharansky founded the Zionist Forum to aid Soviet immigrant in their absorption into Israeli society , and , in the 1990s , he founded the Israel Ba'aliyah party to represent the interest of Russian olim . He served in four successive government , a a minister , and a deputy prime minister.From 2009 to 2018 , he served a chairperson of the Jewish Agency , and upon his retirement , received the Israel Prize for promoting aliya and the ingathering of the exile . Sharansky also received the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1986 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2006 . He is the only living non-American citizen who is the recipient of these two highest American awards.Clearly , there is almost nothing in the Jewish world and in Israel that Sharansky ha not been involved with , in one way or another , in the course of his life . At this challenging time , it seemed appropriate to discus current event with Sharansky.These are difficult time for u , a a people , a a country , a a society . How have you felt since October 7 ? `` Of course , there wa a huge failure here of our intelligence , our army , and our politician . We were deeply invested in incorrect concept . For me , it all started back with Oslo . I said then , that the idea of our bringing a dictator to the Palestinians who would make peace with u & mdash ; because we would make him a dictator by giving him a lot of money & mdash ; did not make sense . It 's just the reverse : the dictator would need u a enemy , and therefore would not make peace with u . `` It continued even with the withdrawal ( from the Gaza Strip , A.W . ) . The idea wa that we would be here , and they would be there , and we could control them that way . As ( Prime Minister ) Arik Sharon explained to me , if they turned militant and tried something , we would go in . I resigned from the government at that time , because of the disengagement . `` `` We have become a united society '' Sharansky belief it wa the spirit of Oslo that caused Israel 's leadership , at all level , to act incorrectly , and led to the failure of October 7 . On the other hand , `` This event wa a reminder of how good it is that we have the State of Israel . There is a poet who wrote that the proximity of Israeli Memorial Day and Holocaust Day help u understand the price of the world with a state and without a state . When we were in the Soviet Union and there wa a surge of antisemitism , could we could fight , go to court ? No ! We just had to get by , take refuge in mathematics and physic , perhaps they 'd leave u alone . Even after 100,000 people were killed ( in pogrom ) , there wa nothing to be done but to run away to America . `` Now , we 're fighting , `` Sharansky declares proudly . `` We have transformed from a most divided society into a united society . We are all sitting in one tank , and our appreciation for the State of Israel ha been renewed . And a much a we called the young generation a TikTok one , it turn out this generation is giving u a lesson in true Zionism , in such a noble , such a brave way . So , good thing are happening . I am optimistic about the future of the State of Israel , but far less optimistic about what is happening in America and Europe . `` Sharansky try to explain what he think is happening nowadays in the West , both in the Jewish context and the wider one . `` The Jews feel they are part of the liberal world , and the liberal world think the progressive are their partner . For year , I wrote about the fact that the real crisis in the United States is not between Republicans and Democrats , but between liberal and progressive . I said that one day , the liberal would realize they were not partner . `` In his various role , Sharansky met with many Jews in the West . `` I asked Jews at university , in the most elite place , if any of the organization they had developed relationship with , befriended over the year , expressed any sympathy after October 7 . I 'm not asking for anything more , just sympathy . They looked and looked , and found one right-leaning organization at Yale that participated in mourning . That 's it . This mean that all the organization on the progressive left see the terrible thing that happened on October 7 a part of a legitimate struggle . This is a big change ; antisemitism came out in a big way . `` Sharansky say in the past he had theory about how to prove a connection between antisemitism and anti-Zionism . `` Today we no longer need a theory , we do n't need to show anything , it 's in everyday life . I hope that the new generation of American Jews will go out in public and fight over this it . `` You said you were encouraged by the unity here , but there is a repeat of the tension we saw before October 7 , is n't there ? `` There is a comeback , but a group of politician and a group of journalist are behind it . The mass are not with them today , unlike what happened until October 7 when half the country thought the other half wa trying to steal their democracy and the other half thought they were trying to steal their Judaism . Today , the people feel that it is important for everyone that there is a Jewish state , and also a free country , and you can see this with almost every bereaved family of a fallen soldier . Also , we see that , in the moment of truth , suddenly , the real and deep thing that unite u still exist . They are n't lost . `` Marxism is backI spoke not long ago with a researcher named Izabella Tabarovsky who belief that the anti-Zionist rhetoric and progressive left activity stem from the Soviet attitude towards Zionism and Israel . Do you agree with this analysis ? `` Yes , of course . I think Izabella is right . There is a large group of people who left he Soviet Union who understand much better than most Americans what exactly happened in America . The whole post-modern ideology that divide the world into oppressed and oppressor is neo-Marxism in it most primitive form . In the study of critical race theory & mdash ; which have become the Koran of the progressive & mdash ; if you replace race with class , you get the ideology of the Bolsheviks in the Soviet Union . There , too , the whole war is between one good side and one bad side , between the proletariat and the capitalist . The capitalist are always wrong and should not be given freedom of speech & mdash ; aside from those who are considered politically correct . And the capitalist world should be destroyed completely , and a just world will be built on this . It is very sad that Marxism ha come back after such a huge failure . It ha come back via the academy because it could not come back through politics . It is always like that , the bad idea always come from the academy . `` When did I first realize that this is what had happened ? `` Sharansky asks , and immediately answer : `` Twenty year ago , I wa touring university in America , and I told Arik Sharon , who wa then prime minister , that this wa where the most important struggle for Israel 's future wa taking place . I saw there for the first time that student were afraid to say what they thought because it would not be good for their career . And a soon that start , it start taking u towards Soviet life . `` How do you overcome this madness ? `` Liberal student , first of all Jewish student , should enter the arena , stand up , and take a strong position . A position that say we are Jews , we are Zionists , Zionism is part of our identity , and the United States , according to it principle , must protect u . It is already starting ; 500 student in Columbia issued a very firm letter , and every day more student are joining , and I believe it will reach more university . In addition , there are now investigation into how Qatar give ten of billion of dollar to university . This must be investigated . `` Correspondence with NavalnyIn February of this year , American journalist Bari Weiss revealed that during April 2023 , Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny , who wa apparently killed in prison , corresponded with Sharansky . Navalny had written to Sharansky , saying he had read `` Fear No Evil , `` Sharansky 's account of his year of struggle against communist rule . In the letter , he also quoted from the Bible : `` That which hath been is that which shall be , `` and said , among other thing , that he `` continues to believe we will fix it , and that one day in Russia there will be what ha not been . `` How did your relationship with Navalny come about ? `` About a year and a half ago , I suddenly received a letter from Navalny through his lawyer . `` A physical letter ? `` A handwritten letter that wa photocopied and sent to my email . `` And what did he say ? `` He said , we did n't know each other , but he wa writing to me a a reader to a writer , because he had read my book and wa amazed at how much the situation had gone back to what it wa when I wa in the Gulag . During my year in prison , I spent 450 day in isolation , Navalny wa already almost 300 day in isolation . It is clear from his letter that he is a free man , and of course I wrote that I admired him and his struggle . It wa clear this wa a very strong man , that he wa optimistic , not because of what wa happening with him , but that he wa optimistic about the victory of his struggle . We had an exchange of letter , and we had a good feeling towards one another `` . What wa in his last letter to you ? `` In the last letter , right before he entered the isolation cell again , he wrote to me : ' I received a letter from you , and I do n't know when I will be able to write to you again , so I 'm simply writing to you . ' What wa interesting is that he ended the letter with the word ' Next year in Jerusalem ' in Russian letter & mdash ; the last word in my book . As if he wanted to join the optimism of Jewish history . `` You are one of the personage most identified with the word `` freedom . `` What is freedom to you ? `` Freedom is when you can do and say thing you believe in . In this respect , in prison I wa much freer than those who interrogated me . During the interrogation , I really liked to tell anti-Soviet joke about Brezhnev . The guard were almost bursting but could not laugh because of the consequence . And I would say to them , ' Well , you want to tell me that I 'm in prison ? You 're in prison & mdash ; you can not laugh . ' For me , freedom is very much related to identity , because we found the strength to fight for our identity only when we became a free people , and vice versa . `` The fact that the West itself ha lost it identity is connected to everything we see now . And here Israel ha a special role . We are part of the free world , yet still insist on maintaining our identity a a Jewish state . `` How did you feel about the judicial overhaul , the conduct of the government , and all the demonstration ? `` I thought both side were wrong . There wa no reason for Netanyahu , who came to power for a four-year term , to try in two month to introduce a law that change thing so significantly . I agreed with most of the element of the reform except for a few thing , but they wanted to do everything immediately . It wa a huge mistake . Let 's say that in the first week Bibi did n't understand that [ Minister of Justice Yariv ] Levin wa rushing something , okay , but after ten week you can already understand it wa a mistake . `` On the other hand , the demonstration shouting to the whole world that this is the end of democracy , that this is a dictatorship , that this is the end of woman 's freedom & mdash ; I think that 's irresponsible . Once one of the organizer of the demonstration asked me , ' Why do n't you come to our demonstration ? ' I asked , ' Why do you shout that this is the end of democracy ? ' He told me , ' Without it , we would n't be able to bring along so many people . ' That 's cynical . `` Too many year in powerSharansky ha known Benjamin Netanyahu since he wa a diplomat . Asked his opinion about Netanyahu and his performance these day , he reply that `` Bibi is a great politician , a great leader . It 's not by chance that he ha been at the head of this country for so long . When I wa in the government , I saw how he fought to liberalize the economy . Thanks to him & mdash ; and I wa there & mdash ; there 's the Taglit-Birthright project , not to mention the fact that he wa first in the world to understand the Iranian threat . And when he wa Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , he began advancing the sanction . He also took office after the Oslo Accords , when there were many commitment in place , and he managed to moderate them . `` Following this praise , Sharansky come to his problem with Netanyahu : `` I think it 's not good when a politician stay in power for too long . I told this to Bibi when I left my position at the Jewish Agency . He asked me ' Perhaps you 'd like another term ? ' I answered , ' Bibi , more than two term is n't healthy . ' He asked , ' Are you telling me that ? ' and I said , ' Yes , you too . ' When you 're in a post like that for a long time , you begin to feel that the best thing for the country would be for you to stay in power & mdash ; and then that becomes the goal . And there is no doubt that he ha also contributed to the divisiveness here . The fact that he started using the word ' leftist ' a word describing an enemy is very bad . `` He should have finished up , and prepared a new generation to replace him , but he felt that there wa no-one who could replace him to save the country , and thought ' I need to stay in power ' . And this , I think , is a mistake . But I will emphasize again that his contribution to the country ha nonetheless been great . ``",sharansky : in prison i wa freer than my interrogator

2024-05-05 12:56:06.120,jpost,"Israel 's cabinet on Sunday voted unanimously to shut down the Qatari news outlet Al Jazeera 's operation in Israel , nearly six month after first announcing it intention to do so due to security concern related to the Israel-Hamas war.The decision , which requires recertification every 45 day , includes shutting down Al Jazeera broadcast in Arabic and English ; shutting down Al Jazeera 's office in Israel ; seizing equipment used for it broadcast ; and limiting access to it websites.Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi signed an executive order soon after the vote passed , and it thus came into effect immediately.Videos on Sunday afternoon showed law enforcement official arriving at Al Jazeera 's Jerusalem office in the Ambassador Hotel . HOT , one of Israel 's major television service provider , announced that it had shut down Al Jazeera 's broadcast . Another provider , YES , ran the following message on the blacked-out channel , `` In accordance with the government decision , the Al Jazeera station 's broadcast have been stopped in Israel . `` In a joint statement following the vote , Netanyahu said that `` Al Jazeera correspondent have harmed the security of Israel and incited against IDF soldier . The time ha come to eject Hamas 's mouthpiece from our country . `` Karhi added , `` We will take immediate action against those who use freedom of the press to harm the security of Israel and IDF soldier , and incite to terrorism in time of war . There will be no freedom of expression for Hamas 's mouthpiece in Israel . `` Al Jazeera condemned the decision , calling it a `` criminal action . `` `` Israel 's suppression of free press to cover up it crime by killing and arresting journalist ha not deterred u from performing our duty , `` it said.Decision go against Mossad chief 's positionIsrael 's National Security Cabinet wa scheduled to hold the vote already on Thursday , but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed it due to concern that the vote would not pas . According to a spokesperson for Minister-without-portfolio MK Benny Gantz 's National Unity party , this wa because Mossad chief David Barnea requested that the government delay it for a few day , so a to avoid possible negative diplomatic ramification relating to Qatar , a mediator between Israel and Hamas in negotiation for a deal to free Israeli hostage . The decision required approval from either the government 's National Security Cabinet ( NSC ) or the general cabinet , and Netanyahu chose to move forward on Sunday in the general cabinet.National Unity 's three minister were not present at the meeting and did not take part in the vote . The party said in a statement that it minister `` support closing Al Jazeera 's broadcast and even announced that they would support it closure in the recent ( national security ) cabinet meeting . `` However , `` Bringing the topic forward this morning for a vote in the government meeting , is a correct decision but with terrible timing , that could undermine effort to exhaust the ( hostage deal ) negotiation , and stem from political consideration , `` the party said.Karhi countered by accusing the centrist National Unity of acting like a `` fifth column `` within the government . According to Karhi , the decision received `` unequivocal validation `` by all security official . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The decision wa based on a law that Israel 's Knesset ( parliament ) passed on April 2 , which expires on July 31 . The legislation will therefore need to be extended if the government wish to extend the banning of Al Jazeera beyond that date . The law itself is also facing a constitutional challenge in the High Court of Justice by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel ( ACRI ) based on it violation of free speech , and the state ha until May 15 to file it preliminary response to the court.The government passed emergency executive measure at the start of the war that would have enabled it to shut down Al Jazeera temporarily . These were in effect from October 21 until January 20 . However , the government refrained from implementing these measure during that period , reportedly due to possible negative diplomatic ramification relating to Qatar.The legislation that passed in April wa aimed at giving the cabinet firmer legal footing to move against Al Jazeera . In it decision on Sunday , the cabinet explained that it had classified opinion from the Shin Bet on April 9 deeming Al Jazeera a national security threat . The IDF and Mossad also provided classified opinion supporting limiting Al Jazeera 's broadcast in Israel.According to the law , the decision must be brought before a regional chief justice or deputy chief justice within 24 hour , who then have three day to decide whether or not to change the decision or limit the length of the ban.In it petition to the High Court of Justice against the law , argued that it unnecessarily limited free speech and wa thus unconstitutional . ACRI said that while there wa no arguing the fact that Al Jazeera ran a `` pro-Palestinian `` narrative , this wa not a sufficient reason to shut down the network . In addition , the network provides content from Arab state and includes Israeli Arab perspective that have been quoted numerously on mainstream Israeli medium , indicating that it content wa viewed a important , ACRI added . The NGO acknowledged that Al-Jazeera had included content that incited against Israel . Still , the severity of this incitement wa no worse than incitement against Palestinians on mainstream Israeli website , ACRI argued.ACRI filed a request on Thursday that the court issue a temporary order barring the government from deciding to shut down Al Jazeera until the case is heard . The court denied the request , and said it would consider a temporary order after receiving the state 's preliminary position .",government vote to shut down al jazeera in israel

2024-04-27 09:06:53.557,jpost,"Berlin Blues , an excellent series that recently became available on Yes , is about an Israeli couple , a musician and a writer , who move with their daughter to Berlin.It examines the drama caused by their being foreigner in a place that offer a stimulating artistic environment but is shadowed by the tragic history of the Holocaust . It also show , very convincingly and sympathetically , how dormant problem in a couple & rsquo ; s relationship can be stirred up by such a move.It wa created by real-life married couple Itamar Rotschild , a musician , and Dana Idisis , the writer of such series and movie a On the Spectrum and Here We Are , who moved to Berlin with their daughter a couple of year ago . They stayed for about a year , then returned to Israel . & nbsp ; Rotschild himself play Yonah , the musician husband in the series . Shira Naor portrays Talya , his wife , a woman who ha published a novel based on the story of her mentally ill brother , and Idisis ha a brother on the autism spectrum , who wa part of the inspiration for some of her recent work . & nbsp ; Given all these similarity , Rotschild , speaking from his backyard in a recent interview , wasn & rsquo ; t exactly surprised when I asked how closely the series wa based on their actual life . & nbsp ; To what extent is the TV series based on real life ? & ldquo ; Let & rsquo ; s talk about the similarity . We moved to Berlin because I wanted the experience of living abroad for a few year . For Dana , it wa after the first season of On the Spectrum and we flew there and lived there for a year and a half , with our daughter . We have two daughter now but then we had only one . For me it wa nice there , I found myself there , I felt good . & rdquo ; So many young Israeli couple spend at least a couple of year abroad that it & rsquo ; s practically a rite of passage , but there haven & rsquo ; t been many fictional portrayal of this phenomenon . Berlin , with it low cost of living and thriving art scene , ha become a destination for thousand of young Israelis . Rotschild and Idisis thought of that when they lived there , although Rotschild emphasized that despite the superficial parallel , it wa not their story . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We knew the feeling of being in Berlin and feeling foreign , but we created the story , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; It can be complicated in so many way to live in a foreign country . There are lot of little thing that you know how they are done at home , but in this new place , everything is different , and you have a feeling of being an outsider . & rdquo ; That feeling put Yonah and Talya & rsquo ; s marriage under a strain : & ldquo ; There were all kind of problem before in their marriage , but they were kind of hidden , but here , in Berlin , everything is amplified . You are still you , but the new setting brings out thing that were more under control before . & rdquo ; When Talya return to Israel for a single episode , she is confronted by tough reality of the life she left behind there , notably that there are frequent missile attack from Gaza during her visit & ndash ; a disclaimer note that the episode wa filmed before October 7 & ndash ; and that her brother and her parent are in denial about the severity of his mental illness . & nbsp ; In a particularly harrowing scene , he insists on returning to work at his job at the Ramat Gan Safari after he ha been fired , and when Talya try to take him home , he jump out of the car near several hippopotamus . & ldquo ; You see that so much is hard for her in Israel , too , how complicated it is for her there . & rdquo ; THE RELATIONSHIP of Israelis to Germany is also complicated in all kind of way and Berlin Blues deal with that head-on . When Yonah & rsquo ; s mother ( Liora Rivlin ) come for a visit , she can barely contain her anger at her son for choosing to live in the country that persecuted her parent . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Lots of people are & lsquo ; anti [ German ] , & rsquo ; because of their parent , people don & rsquo ; t want to buy German good , wouldn & rsquo ; t want to buy a German car . I even know people my from my generation who won & rsquo ; t go to Germany . . . Yonah & rsquo ; s mother ha a real issue that is connected to the trauma of what so many Jews went through there , and I think that we tried to show what & rsquo ; s behind it , and she isn & rsquo ; t just & lsquo ; anti , & rsquo ; but you see at the end , with her monologue in German , that she ha a real connection to the country because of her parent , she isn & rsquo ; t just & lsquo ; anti . & rsquo ; & rdquo ; Another way that the series differs from his own life , Rotschild said , is that , & ldquo ; My music and the music in the series are two different thing . & rdquo ; Rotschild is a guitarist and pianist who writes and performs in a folk-rock style . He ha released a number of album and is at work now on a new one , while Yonah is an oboist who get a position with a Berlin orchestra . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I wa never in an orchestra . We thought about what would keep Yonah in Berlin , so that it make the conflict between him and Talya , who want to go home , stronger , and we thought of having him be an oboe player . The oboe is an instrument that maybe one or two people in orchestra can play full-time in Israel , but it & rsquo ; s hard to make a living at it here . But in Europe , you can make a living at it , there are a lot of orchestra there . & rdquo ; Rotschild had never played the oboe and learned enough to look convincing handling the instrument on screen . & ldquo ; I had a very good teacher , Shani Shachar , and she taught me how to play it and hold it and how to blow in it and how to clean it and how to get a sound from it . It & rsquo ; s a very difficult instrument just to get a sound out of & ndash ; and I & rsquo ; m not talking about a beautiful sound , just any sound at all . & ldquo ; We did a lot of research to get into the world of classical musician , to check how it sound , how it feel , what it & rsquo ; s like , because it wasn & rsquo ; t a world we knew . It & rsquo ; s music that I like , but it isn & rsquo ; t music , or a world , that I really know . & rdquo ; Rotschild said that the director of the series , Ram Nehari , who worked with them for two year , & ldquo ; helped to make the series what is today , he directed it beautifully and also worked on the script . He had a big influence on how well it turned out . & rdquo ; Rotschild & rsquo ; s most important role prior to Berlin Blues wa also a a musician , in the series , The Echo of Your Voice . Rotschild played a struggling artist who is the son of an Arik Einstein-like , all-time great performer , just a the Rotschild character & rsquo ; s own son becomes a rising star . In an unusual achievement , the three lead actor , Rotschild , Shaul Luria , and Orr Amrami Brockman , shared the award for Best Actor at the prestigious Series Mania competition in France . & nbsp ; But when asked whether he intends to continue acting , Rotschild said , & ldquo ; Acting is fun for me . It & rsquo ; s a kind of vacation , like taking a vacation from myself . & rdquo ; Despite his success a an actor , he said , & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not my profession . It seems to me that people who are professional actor have to take part that are not what they really like , that are not that good , because that & rsquo ; s what they do . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I & rsquo ; m not there . I only do thing I like . So if someone brings me a part that I can connect to , I & rsquo ; ll do it gladly , it & rsquo ; s fun when you feel that you can express yourself through it . But I & rsquo ; m not an actor . I & rsquo ; m a musician who sometimes act . & ldquo ;",new tv series ‘ berlin blue ’ brings berlin to life

Herzi Halevi addressed the nation from the southern border : & ldquo ; I want to be clear , we are ready to invade , & rdquo ; he declared , a the IDF continued to weigh the timing of the ground war in coordination with the political echelon.Expanding on the delay , which ha puzzled some , Halevi said , & ldquo ; At this stage , there are tactical and strategic factor that are allowing u more time to improve and to exploit every minute to be more ready . & rdquo ; In contrast , & ldquo ; with every minute that pass for the other side , we are attacking the enemy more , killing their fighter , killing their commander , destroying their infrastructure , and collecting more intelligence for the next move . & rdquo ; Continued rocket barrage toward IsraelThe North wa hit a well with rocket barrage on Tuesday , a Hezbollah fired an anti-tank missile at the border community of Shtula , and fired on Elkosh .

Meanwhile , it continues to prepare for the expected ground incursion , which includes preparing a many unit a are needed with training refresher course in urban combat a well a general training for reservist . So far , 300,000 reservist have been called up since the war began.While Hezbollah ha deployed anti-tank missile , rocket , mortar , drone , and small arm to threaten Israel , the IDF ha continued to eliminate terrorist squad attempting to infiltrate . The IDF said five cell were eliminated on Monday and more were taken out Tuesday afternoon.The Alma Research and Education Center noted that & ldquo ; since the start of the war in the northern arena , there have been two infiltration attempt , 200 rocket and mortar launch , and 30 ATGM [ anti-tank missile ] attack & rdquo ; from Lebanon.Across the region , Iranian-backed proxy used drone to attack US force in Iraq and Syria .

2024-03-26 01:15:24.903,jpost,"The continued reality that 90 % of adult haredi ( ultra-Orthodox ) male are exempt from national service ha no moral , halachic , or security justification . This wa true before October 7 and ha become a critical issue since . Having formed part of the debate during the period of legal reform before the war , it is now a burning public issue.There are many people responsible for the fact that the haredi community ha been exempted for the 76 year since the creation of the State of Israel , starting with David Ben-Gurion and including pretty much every government since.But in the very real-world crisis in which Israel find itself , the issue ha crystallized due to the huge sacrifice made by conscripted and reserve soldier since October 7 and the army & rsquo ; s need for more combat force . With the immediate and long-term requirement for battle-trained soldier going up , the haredi leadership is doubling down on it rhetoric.Currently , the only thing standing between real change in government policy and the untenable status quo is the political need of the prime minister , backed by the religious Zionist party in the government . It is time for the moral mass on the political and religious right to call their leader out and demand a change of course . The fact that any change will take time to have an impact only increase the urgency for action.The country need more soldier , in particular combat soldier . In order to achieve this , the army is demanding that conscripted soldier extend their service and that those in reserve be called upon for extended period of service for the foreseeable future . There is a limited number of population that can provide additional pool for recruitment , namely , female soldier ( whose number in combat role is on the rise ) and haredi men.The government is in a bind . Public opinion is now strongly and emotively against any extension of the blanket exemption for over 60,000 haredi yeshiva student , and on the other hand , the government is politically beholden to the haredi party , which a yet remain firm in their resistance.The law allowing for the haredi exemption actually expired in June 2023 , and now there are several case before the Supreme Court calling for two measure a a result . One is to force the Defense Ministry & rsquo ; s hand and start calling up haredi men , and the second is to halt any financial support for the yeshivot , with student now legally required to enlist . Both outcome are political causus belli for the haredi parties.Raising the age of exemptionIn an attempt to stave off these sanction , the government is mulling a decision that will , among other thing , increase the age of exemption to 34 . This mean that any haredi not performing national service will not be legally allowed to work until they are 34 . Currently , the age is 26 . This will turn the clock back to 2010.Dr . Gilad Malach of the Israel Democracy Institute is an expert on government policy on conscription and haredi . He note that , in contrast to what is now being claimed by the government , not only will this not increase the number of haredi joining the IDF but it may cause the opposite . According to Malach , all the data show just the opposite . & ldquo ; History and experience have shown u that it will also have a negative impact on the quality and quantity of the haredi participation in the employment market . The later haredi seek training or employment , the less likely they will be able to train for highly skilled work , & rdquo ; he says.Alternatively , reducing the age of exemption cause more haredi to seek employment at a younger age , with the ability to skill up in order to exploit the opportunity . Instead of raising the age , Malach and all the expert would prefer that the government reduce it.Yoav Gradus , director-general of the Budget Department in Israel & rsquo ; s Ministry of Finance , issued a letter to the defense minister on Sunday , following the publication of the proposed government decision . Reports in the press stressed that the decision wa being driven without the normal professional input from relevant government ministry , which only increase the sense that the decision is purely political , without any real prospect of a positive impact on either increased participation in the army or the economy.In the letter , he is quite specific : & ldquo ; From an economic point of view , the condition connecting the non-conscription of men and their non-integration into the labor market led , a mentioned , to the creation of employment pattern that produce long-term damage to the entire economy . & rdquo ; Shaked reflects on decade of failureIn a stunning and unusually candid moment from an Israeli politician , former minister of justice Ayelet Shaked , who wa closely involved in the conscription law passed in 2014 , admitted that all her hope for the law and the process it wa meant to create have failed . & ldquo ; At the time we passed the law , the annual haredi cohort of boy numbered 8,000 , and 1,200 were conscripted . After 10 year , we didn & rsquo ; t reach ( our target of ) 6,000 . Indeed , the cohort ha grown to 12,000 , and the number of conscript is 1,800 , & rdquo ; she told a recent conference at Tel Aviv University . In the meantime , the army & rsquo ; s need have grown dramatically . & nbsp ; No magic bulletThere are no easy fix to this entrenched problem . Nobody expects or belief that mass of haredi will join the IDF immediately , no matter what policy is employed by the government . However , the need to shift course is now . At the very least , the government ha to begin the process.For this to happen , one of two thing will have to occur . Either the Likud and the Religious Zionist Party will have to force the issue with the haredi party or there will have to be election with the ball dropping into the lap of the next government . Urgency demand that this happens under the auspex of the current government . Politics determines that this is an unlikely outcome.For the first to happen , Netanyahu and Smotrich will have to switch course , the risk being that the haredi party will bolt the coalition and the government will fall . On the other hand , Gantz , Eisenkot , and perhaps Defense Minister Gallant can force their hand by either demanding a different policy or delivering an ultimatum to leave the government . Of course , election will delay the process.One way or another , there will soon be irresistible public pressure for change . This will have to include reduced government budget supporting yeshiva for haredi who do not serve and increasing budget for haredi institution and program that encourage national service , whether military or civilian . The government must support school teaching core study and social responsibility and reduce budget to school that are not preparing their student to make a full contribution to Israeli society . & nbsp ; Nobody want to see Haredim stop being loyal to their religious identity , but most Israelis are in no mood to see the status quo extended.The writer , a founding partner of Goldrock Capital , is the founder of The Institute for Jewish and Zionist Research .

2024-06-18 11:21:42.280,jpost,"Israel & rsquo ; s High Court of Justice on Tuesday held a significant hearing in a petition put forth by several organization against a law passed by the coalition in late December 2022 that expanded the authority of the soon-to-be , now-National Security Minister , MK Itamar Ben-Gvir.The case reached it climax after a series of procedural stage and wa heard in front of an expanded bench of nine High Court justices.It wa passed in the Knesset on December 27 , two day before the current government wa sworn in , after Ben-Gvir set it a a precondition for his joining the coalition.The law wa an amendment to Israel & rsquo ; s Police Law ( also known a the Police Ordinance ) . It anchored the police & rsquo ; s subordination to the government , a well a allowing for the national security minister to set policy and general principles.Further , it enabled the minister to set policy regarding investigation after consulting with the attorney-general , the police commissioner , and the officer responsible for investigations.The leading petitioner , the Movement for Quality Government in Israel ( MQG ) , argued at the hearing that Ben-Gvir & rsquo ; s conduct since taking office proved that the law wa dangerous , a it de facto enabled the minister to intervene in operational matter , including in the treatment of individual protesting against the government.MQG chairman Adv . Eliad Shraga said to reporter outside of the courtroom , & ldquo ; We have seen everything that we have warned against come true in the last year and a half . We have seen the minister meddling in the policy regarding investigation ; we have seen the minister meddling in operative law enforcement policy ; we have seen the minister meddling in appointment policy ; and we have seen the minister running the police . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; This is an abnormal situation where the police are effectively a militia at the service of the minister . We live in a democratic country , and so we insist that the amendment to the Police Ordinance be repealed & mdash ; that the Israel Police be an institution of the state , subject only to the rule of law , & rdquo ; Shraga punctuated.Other petitioner included Yesh Atid MKs Yoav Segalovitz and Mickey Levy , both of whom served in senior role at the police in the past ; the Labor Party ; the Association for Civil Rights in Israel ( ACRI ) ; and the High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel.Adv . Aner Hellman of the Attorney-General Office & rsquo ; s High Court of Justice division argued during the hearing that the part of the law regarding investigation needed to be struck down a unconstitutional since it did not include provision to protect citizen from violation of human rights.Hellman added that the part of the law giving the minister the ability to set policy should also be struck down unless the court clarifies what exactly qualifies a & ldquo ; policy . & rdquo ; According to Hellman , & ldquo ; policy & rdquo ; must be defined in advance and can not be set during a specific addition . Moreover , the legality of these policy decision must first be deemed legal by the ministry & rsquo ; s legal adviser.A lawyer for Ben-Gvir , Adv . Nadav Haetzni , argued in response that the fact that Ben-Gvir ha made controversial policy decision since taking office doe not mean that the law itself is unconstitutional . According to Haetzni , the minister should have the right to set general policy , and if the minister gave specific operational order , these could be challenged in a separate process in the High Court.In reference to this , Hellman and others argued that illegal operational directive given by Ben-Gvir could not always be appealed in real time and that the potential for human right violation wa serious enough to render the law unconstitutional . The law should especially clarify that the police , and not the minister , were responsible for making decision in real-time regarding protest against the government.Ben-Gvir attended part of debateBen-Gvir attended part of the debate and at one point even interrupted his attorney , saying that he would not agree to be a & ldquo ; plant , & rdquo ; i.e . , a passive observer of the police & rsquo ; s action . This continued a claim made by Ben-Gvir on Tuesday that outgoing Israel Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai and the Attorney General & rsquo ; s Office were colluding against him to prevent him from applying his policies.Indeed , the hearing came during an ugly public spat between Shabtai and Ben-Gvir . Shabtai complained to the attorney-general in recent week that , on numerous occasion , the national security minister had illegally bypassed him and spoken directly to lower-ranking police officers.Ben-Gvir , in turn , accused Shabtai of not functioning properly since the result of the Mount Meron tragedy report were made public in March.The report found several official , including Shabtai , former public security minister Amir Ohana , and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , personally responsible for the catastrophe in which 45 haredi were crushed to death during a mass Lag Ba & rsquo ; omer event at the grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in 2021.Shabtai himself attended the hearing and wished to speak , but the judge denied his request . Shabtai instead spoke to reporter outside . & ldquo ; I came here today out of a deep concern for the future of the Israel Police a a professional , apolitical & rdquo ; member of the police , without any specific agenda , Shabtai said . & ldquo ; I did not come here against some minister or other . I came simply to present our position about the significance and consequence of this law . Expanding the authority [ of the minister ] could affect democracy in the State of Israel , & rdquo ; he emphasized .","high court begin hearing on ben-gvir law , police chief expected to oppose"

The May attack included 401 firebombings , 33 pipe bomb , 87 arson attack , 47 small-arm fire , two grenade attack , one vehicular attack and others . & nbsp ; One Israeli civilian , Yehuda Guetta , wa also killed in a shooting attack at the Tapuah junction in early May by 44-year-old Muntasir Shalabi . & nbsp ; Most of the attack that took place were not carried out by group but by lone wolf . Those kind of attack , the IDF ha admitted , are much more challenging to thwart than attack planned by group . If you don & rsquo ; t have an organization , you don & rsquo ; t have the signature of the preparation of the specific attack . & nbsp ; Despite the challenge , the great majority of attack have been thwarted by security force . But the high number of thwarted attack also indicate that the flame of violence are growing in the West Bank . & nbsp ; While there have been significantly fewer vehicular attack a well a stabbings and shooting attack against IDF soldier , they remain a major threat , especially toward driver on the road shared by both Palestinians and Israelis . & nbsp ; According to the IDF , shooting or vehicular ramming attack are more likely to be carried out by young men , and child are behind many case of stone throwing . & nbsp ; Along with the high number of attack against Israeli target , a report by Ynet news found that 34 Palestinians were killed over the past month , & ldquo ; more than during any month in the past 10 year . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Comparing the past month to the height of the wave of knife and vehicular-ramming attack that took place in 2015-2016 , an average of 26 Palestinians were killed every month . & nbsp ; SO WHAT & rsquo ; S happening ? & nbsp ; With the cancellation of the May Palestinian election in late April , the public ha lost all faith in their leader who they say have abandoned the cause a long time ago . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , they say , ha remained silent about the beating of protester and worshiper by Israel . & nbsp ; The reestablishment of the illegal settlement of Evyatar ha led to repeated violent clash between Israeli security force and local Palestinians . Four Palestinian teenager have been killed in recent week . & nbsp ; Like on the Gaza border , Palestinian youth have been taking part in night disturbance with loud riot and setting fire to tire . In one video uploaded to YouTube , demonstrator chant & ldquo ; Greeting from the steadfast village of Beita to the steadfast city in Gaza . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Evyatar wa reestablished by settler in April on land that historically belonged to the Palestinian village of Beita , Kabalan and Yatma . Residents have been barred from the land for decade by the Israeli military for security reason . & nbsp ; The IDF ha made it clear that the outpost will be demolished , with the IDF & rsquo ; s Central Command writing that & ldquo ; the Evyatar outpost wa established illegally , and everything wa done in complete violation of the law . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; But , even when it will be demolished , local aren & rsquo ; t holding their breath . They know that another illegal settlement will likely be built on another hill . & nbsp ; And while the fighting between Israel and the terrorist group in the Gaza Strip ended , the initial reason behind Hamas & rsquo ; s rocket fire remains : clash on the Temple Mount . Last week nine Palestinians were wounded by sponge-tipped bullet and stun grenade used by Israeli police when they clashed at the holy site . & nbsp ; While rocket are not raining down on Israel , incendiary balloon have caused dozen of fire to rage across southern Israel . & nbsp ; Hamas ha repeatedly warned that it would once again fire rocket into Israel and restart hostility over development in Jerusalem . Terrorist group on Tuesday warned that if Israel doe not allow humanitarian relief into the blockaded enclave , they will once again resort to violence . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We warn the Israeli enemy and it ally of delaying the lifting of the siege . The enemy will not succeed with it extortion policy , and we will not sit back a our people are pushed over , & rdquo ; the group said in a statement quoted by Israeli medium . & nbsp ; Hamas leader Yayha Sinwar , who met with Tor Wennesland , the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process , said Monday that the talk failed , and accused Israel of extortion , urging Palestinians to resist . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It wa a bad meeting , & rdquo ; Sinwar said .

2023-11-26 16:10:58.753,jpost,"Against the backdrop of the ongoing 46th day of the war against Hamas , the question arises of how the terrorist organization perceives the large-scale ground operation carried out by the IDF in the Gaza Strip.In a conversation with Yinon Magal and Barak Seri on 103FM , Zvi Yehezkeli , the head of the Arab Desk at Channel 13 , commented on the mindset of Hamas since the outbreak of the conflict.What were they thinking when they committed the horrific massacre on October 7 ? `` Killing Jews is Yahya Sinwar 's strongest instinct . We are currently in the midst of a military operation , with the army actively engaged , showcasing an incredible fighting spirit . `` Now , let 's discus the future . As long a there is a political entity in the Gaza Strip , you will always have Hamas . You can not eradicate Hamas ; it 's deeply engrained in the Palestinian identity , more so than Fatah or anything else . If the situation in the north Gaza Strip were to replicate itself in the south Gaza Strip & ndash ; with refugee seeking protection elsewhere and finding host country & ndash ; leaving the Gaza Strip without Hamas and a large population will be impossible . `` It 's either Hamas or the people . Eventually , whoever governs the Gaza Strip will never accept your existence . No Palestinians , in any form , neither the Palestinian Authority nor a reformed Authority , will acknowledge your presence . `` What do you propose for the day after ? `` What ha happened in Gaza can also happen in the West Bank . We have a zero-sum game with the Palestinians , and if we fail to realize this , it will consume u . Even in Judea and Samaria , my friend , it 's just a matter of time . `` Just ask the resident of settlement ; they know this is coming their way . Palestinians passing by the fence warn u , ' We will do to you what they did to you in Gaza . ' I receive call from Haredi individual living in Beitar Illit , telling me , ' The Arabs are coming , and Gaza is a precursor . ' `` Understand that something ha fundamentally changed regarding Palestinian existence . They have achieved what Nasrallah did in 2000 ; they managed to enter , kill , and massacre , and we did nothing . `` Does witnessing the ongoing event in Gaza not make them think twice ? `` Their concern is not for the resident . Yahya Sinwar doe n't care that two million people have become refugee . It simply doe n't matter to him . He belief it is a noble cause , something greater than himself , and it would be a miscalculation if he doe n't pursue it . `` Hence , even if you push it towards the West Bank , even if it 's true that Abu Mazen doe n't incite them for jihad , the public will . Is Jenin no longer like Gaza ? Is Nablus no longer like Gaza ? These are small place that have embraced jihad . Jihad hold greater significance for them than anything else , even if it brings them down and backfire . `` Yehezkeli also said , `` Gaza , before the massacre , wa in a state of development . They built infrastructure and thriving building . Yet , they are willing to destroy all of it , reducing it to rubble , just to fight you . They know that eventually , you will feel remorse over their situation and leave . `` There 's an Arabic saying , ' If you want your stock to rise , deal with a Jew . They will always take care of you . ' The mercy of the Jews is something Arabs praise & ndash ; their compassion . They know we wo n't turn the table ; they know we are merciful . A soldier said to me , ' Jews kill to survive , while Arabs live to kill . ' That 's the difference . `` `` Every day the token fall to u , we are in the Middle East . This war is not a month or two , I think something strategic ha happened here , the State of Israel is about to go through a huge process for the next few year . You will not stop seeing soldier here in reserve and with weapon . `` This will not end friend , it will not end in Gaza , it will continue to Judea and Samaria . We have many more arena . What , do you think that Nasrallah ha finished his story ? `` he asked.Part of the argument for not launching a preemptive strike and a second front against Nasrallah and Hezbollah wa that `` we will dismantle Hamas `` so that those in the north will see what we are doing and not want to enter.Are you saying it make no impression on them ? `` If you end Gaza in a ' wow ' way , everyone will step back and say , ' Listen , the Jews did something that is beyond their nature , and that 's it . ' `` What is beyond nature ? `` What is beyond nature ? That no Palestinian refugee remain in the Gaza Strip . `` What ? Where will the two million go ? `` 200,000 to 10 country , what 's the problem ? Germany took in four million Syrian refugee , Europe took in another two million , Lebanon took in two million from Assad , Jordan took in Egypt . Those who protect the Palestinians all the time , what 's the problem if they take some Palestinians ? What 's the problem ? Why ca n't they ? `` You will not be able to establish your control and for the State of Israel to be safe , a long a you have an entity there that will always threaten you . Or you will once again build shield and protected room , etc . `` How is Dahlan ? Is he planning to return to Gaza ? `` I do n't know .

2020-12-29 21:16:05.783,jpost,"Relationships developed between Israel and Qatar to provide sufficient funding to Hamas and avoid an economic collapse and war in the Gaza Strip could be the engine for normalization between Jerusalem and Doha , The Jerusalem Post ha learned . Pressed that in November , Qatar rejected any imminent normalization with Israel , source told the Post confidently that this would likely change during the incoming Biden administration & rsquo ; s term . Further , they said that close coordination between Israel and Qatar to facilitate sufficient funding for Hamas to keep Gaza & rsquo ; s weak economy from collapsing will likely be the key to moving Doha to a normalization deal . Ironically , even a Hamas is committed to Israel & rsquo ; s destruction and periodically fire rocket at Israeli town and city , the strange dynamic with Gaza & rsquo ; s ruler could help bring a legitimacy coup for Israel with the state that run the influential Al Jazeera network . Qatar ha long been a focal point for many party in the Middle East and Doha ha been in a diplomatic and economic war with Saudi Arabia and other moderate Sunni Gulf country since June 2017 . In mid-December , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with Qatari Emir , Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani , to try to convince him to host a peace conference in 2021 . The idea would be to move the conversation back from the Trump peace plan to the previous conventional Palestinian-Western plan for peace . Surrounding all these contact with Qatar is the fact that the US maintains close relation , including it key military base in the Middle East , in Qatar . The combination of a US connection along with Qatar & rsquo ; s ability to keep Hamas from starting a broad war , a occurred three time between 2009-2014 , wa part of what made Israel , through the Mossad , ready to deal with Doha on Gaza issue . This wa in spite of Jerusalem & rsquo ; s unhappiness with many of the more Islamist cause and group which Qatar support , including that it ha a strong relationship with Iran . With Israel & rsquo ; s approval , and often with Mossad Director Yossi Cohen & rsquo ; s personal involvement , Qatar ha periodically provided million of dollar in cash to Hamas to keep it economic situation stable so that it will not want war . When Hamas grew anxious that the payment would end in August , Cohen reportedly even took an especially active role to convince Doha to continue them , despite economic issue in Qatar related to the pandemic . When attacked by some on the Right that the Mossad and Israel are serving a a middle-man to fund Hamas , Cohen ha pushed back hard saying that the fund are humanitarian and that complex decision are preferable to war . Sources also indicated that there could be a breakthrough in unfreezing relation between Qatar and the Saudi-led Gulf state coalition a early a next week , while Trump is still in office . Statements by official on the possibility of Israeli-Qatari normalization have to date been mixed . In October , US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Qatar but declined to tell the Israeli medium anything definitive about whether Qatar would be the next country to normalize tie with Israel or whether the US will sell it F-35 stealth jet . Also in October , Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Army Radio that to preserve it qualitative military edge , Israel will ask the US not to sell F-35 fighter jet to Qatar . & ldquo ; For u , our region still hasn & rsquo ; t become Switzerland . Israel is the most threatened country , not only in the Middle East , but in the whole world , and a such , we need to preserve our superiority , & rdquo ; he said . In mid-December , Rabbi Marc Schneier , an unofficial envoy for normalization with Gulf state , told the Post : & ldquo ; I won & rsquo ; t be content until I see Qataris , Saudis , Omanis and Kuwaitis join a well . Then , you will see a transformation . & rdquo ; Qatar is preparing for the World Cup , and Schneier think it is a natural fit for Israel . & ldquo ; Qataris are very excited about welcoming Israelis for the World Cup , & rdquo ; he said . Schneier ha worked on addressing the need of kosher cuisine in Doha . & ldquo ; In regard to the question about Israeli guest coming to watch the game , the Qataris have already said that they will be allowed to do so , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; But I believe that by November 2022 [ the start of the World Cup ] , we will already see relation between them and Israel . & rdquo ; He also said that moving forward with Qatar might require progress with the Palestinians , but that this could also be more likely with the incoming Biden administration .",how hamas could be the engine for qatar-israel normalization

Weapons seemed to flow freely in Arab town , in what to local felt like a lawless land , but since the Safe Route crackdown , the police say they have turned the tide and restored law and order.But are the operation & rsquo ; s effect really felt in Arab community a the police claim ? In the enforcement of the operation , mostly in the North , 3,871 suspect were arrested , thousand of weapon were seized , and 1,153 indictment were filed for weapon offense across Israel.Since the beginning of the year , the police have increased their activity against weapon crime in Arab community . In the past half-year ( January-June 2022 ) , the police across the country arrested 3,871 suspect for crime of armed robbery and shooting , and about 92 % of the suspect arrested were from the Arab community.Also , in the first half of 2022 , at the end of the police investigation , 1,153 indictment were filed against those accused of shooting and assault offense all over the country .

Leon Hirsch , head of the Operational Coordination Section in the Police Intelligence Division . & ldquo ; The Israel Police ha also recorded significant achievement in filing indictment for these crime which constitute a significant nuisance to the public in Arab community . Since the operation began , there ha been a much higher demand for police service , and we see this in the response we receive from the resident , & rdquo ; he added.Seizing weapon , arresting criminalsDuring this period in 2022 , ten of thousand of weapon , explosive , ammunition , grenade and other illegal item were seized in town of Arab community , including 770 handgun , and more than 100 submachine gun and 350 gun of different type , thousand of item of ammunition , a well a hundred of grenade , weapon part and explosive & ndash ; a significant increase when compared to the same time period in 2021.The operation ha been carried out so far in 19 locality , including Haifa , Umm el-Fahm , Nazareth and Rahat.After almost half of 2022 ha passed , data show that the extensive operation launched by the police to eradicate violence resulted in success & ndash ; at least partially : until June 5 , 31 people in the Arab community were murdered in Israel , including four woman , compared to 50 murdered in the first half of 2021 ( up to May 27 to be exact ) . In total , according to police data , since the beginning of the year , 42 people have been murdered throughout the country , of which , a mentioned , 31 were from Arab society . So far the police have solved only 12 murder case in the Arab sector this year . The police attribute this decrease in the number of murder in the sector to the operation.Murder on the riseDespite the effort police have put forward , some remain skeptical about the actual effect they have , a murder case in Arab society continue to rise , hitting 55 murder up until July , according to data from independent NGOs.WHILE POLICE action are at the forefront of the operation , it is much larger in scope when looked at from a broader lens . Efforts of the Finance Ministry and income tax official , for example , set out to combat money laundering and illegal loan , which in turn entangle many civilian . & ldquo ; Many Arab town in the North don & rsquo ; t even have a bank or any other mean of legally handling financial affair . Left out of option , they turn to organized criminal syndicate , & rdquo ; Ola Najami-Yousef & ldquo ; Many Arab town in the North don & rsquo ; t even have a bank or any other mean of legally handling financial affair . Left out of option , they turn to organized criminal syndicate , & rdquo ; Ola Najami-Yousef , vice president of the Abraham Initiative NGO , which track crime in Arab community , told the Magazine in an interview.The issue , she explained , is much larger than a simple lack of policing . The Arab community have long faced neglect from all governmental office , from finance to education . Residents are often left to their own device , something that leaf a large vacuum for criminal to fill.Arabs were viewed a a security threat themselvesBefore Safe Route wa initiated , Arabs were viewed a a & ldquo ; security threat themselves . Even though a lot of these issue were well known to the government , nothing wa done , until now . & ldquo ; The way Arab society is viewed and discussed ha changed ; we & rsquo ; re no longer social pariah , and a wide range of effort is now being undertaken to give Arab community what they rightfully deserve a Israeli citizen , & rdquo ; she said.THE PROBLEM with crime in the community often stemmed from this larger perspective that painted Arabs a a collective threat.Even if a plain citizen got entangled with criminal element on account of a lack of service , he had no one to turn to when thing turned sour , a situation that not only left an opening for crime on it own but also severely hurt the community & rsquo ; trust in the police , further increasing the reign of criminals.In town like Nazareth , where Najami-Yousef life , you could hardly notice police presence , and town like Jisr e-Zarka didn & rsquo ; t even have a functional police station , even though the building for it existed.Now , police are making effort to increase their presence , understanding that the lack of trust from local severely impact how well they could combat crime effectively.The change is certainly being felt.Jasser & rsquo ; s police station , which had been vacant until now , is fully staffed , and town like Rahat and Nazareth are seeing more patrol car on the street . Najami-Yousef , a resident of Nazareth herself , even stated that & ldquo ; you could even hear less gunfire in Nazareth these day . & rdquo ; To further the bond with the community , the Abraham Initiative ha organized meeting between teen and police officer from local station . The change , Najami-Yousef said , is slowly starting to take effect.But when looking at the still high murder rate which claimed the life of 11 Arabs in the last month , one could question the effectiveness of this change . & ldquo ; These thing take time , & rdquo ; Najami-Yousef explained . & ldquo ; It may take up to five year until we would see a practical change in murder . & rdquo ; Najami-Yousef even theorized that the latest chain of murder could be a direct response to police effort , with criminal organization feeling the pressure and , in turn , attempting to clean house.Police official claimed , on the other hand , that the operation ha attained significant achievement , and that the decrease in the number of murder is felt & ldquo ; everywhere & rdquo ; in the Arab sector.One of the reason for this , according to them , is that budget are now being diverted to combating violence in the sector , making it possible to strengthen the force stationed in the Arab community and also recruit Arabs directly to the police . & ldquo ; In the last five year , 800 Muslims have been recruited to the Israel Police . Today the police can react quickly when case of violence occur , & rdquo ; a police official said . & ldquo ; Along with the continuation of enforcement and it deepening , in order to deal with the phenomenon and completely deter it , a multisystemic treatment and a deep-rooted change beyond police enforcement are needed , & rdquo ; said Ch . - Supt . Hirsch . & ldquo ; The Israel Police will continue the determined fight in Arab society and everywhere else , all in order to maintain public peace and security . & rdquo ; ■",have israel 's police helped stem the tide of arab sector crime ?

The prisoner claim that the IPS ha failed to fulfill it previous promise to ease severe restriction that were imposed on them in the aftermath of the jail break by six inmate from Gilboa Prison last year . The restriction include , among other thing , solitary confinement and the transfer of dozen of inmate to other prisons.The prisoner then announced a series of protest against the restriction and threatened to go on a hunger strike.Last March , however , they agreed to suspend their protest after reportedly receiving a promise from the IPS to ease the restrictions.On Sunday , the Palestinian Prisoners Club , a group that support the security prisoner , said the inmate would resume their protest on Monday.It said they would refuse to leave their cell for routine security check & ldquo ; a a step of disobedience against the prison administration law . & rdquo ; What 's next for the Palestinian prisoner ?

2024-04-07 21:43:04.017,jpost,"Lines of freshly planted tree . Israeli flag , each at a different height on a stick above where a tree will one day grow , fly in the wind . It & rsquo ; s been six month since the Nova festival massacre took place here.On each flag is printed the name of one of the victim who wa killed here , or in the nearby forest and field , during the massacre . Meanwhile , the sound of artillery can be heard in the distance . By this late point in the day , the military had already announced that it wa rotating force out of Gaza.A sense of change , noted by the passage of half a year , can be felt here . Time continues to pas , and each day end , but there is no closure for the family , who are left in limbo while Hamas continues to hold 134 hostages.On Sunday morning , family of the Nova victim gathered at the site . They talked of the feeling of abandonment they experienced , especially from the government ; they talked of pain , of getting treatment for that pain . They spoke about how this massacre could have been prevented , and how difficult it is to return to life.Right then wa when the news broke that a mourner & rsquo ; s wreath wa sent to the family of 19-year-old hostage Liri Albag , blaming the government for the lack of a deal . The Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) later said it suspected Iranian force were behind it . It wa a if the news hammered home just how deeply wrong it is that this is still the situation six month later.How can it be that six month into the war the hostage are held just across the border from where I am standing ? Gaza is not very large , so wherever you stand along the border , you are always a few mile from the coast and not far from Rafah . There are 134 people across the border ; IDF unit are being withdrawn . Israeli citizen were promised that & ldquo ; there won & rsquo ; t be any more Hamas & rdquo ; when the war wa over , and that military pressure would lead to the release of the hostage . From the border , it is obvious that neither ha come to pass.For me , Sunday wa a return to a border I & rsquo ; ve been to many time since October 7 , a well a before the war a well . Back in 2005 , before the Disengagement from Gaza , I visited Netzer Hazani , a settlement in Gaza near Khan Yunis.Border region became a target for HamasAfterward , this border region became a target for Hamas ; rocket rained down on Sderot . This a place where there were many war : in 2009 , 2012 , 2014 , and briefly in 2021 ; it always carried danger . At Kibbutz Nirim , a resident told of threat dating back to the 1970s . There wa always a threat from Gaza , but there were also time of peace and effort at coexistence.The sense on Sunday , at Nova , is that all that is broken . The festival ground today are made up of various memorial , like the new section of tree that will grow and an area of photo of the victim , staked in the ground so that each victim ha their area.Besides the few monument , such a some bench and individual make-shift memorial people have left , or graffiti on a concrete bunker , much remains a it would have been before the festival . There are tree with no undergrowth ; there is a dirt road running down Route 232 , which run parallel to the border . It wa on this dirt road , from the festival ground to the main road , where car would have been stacked up on October 7 after the festival organizer stopped the music and told everyone to run and hide.I look around among the tree and think about the thousand of people fleeing ; their desperation and confusion . The area is familiar to me from the many video that came out that morning ; the bathroom where people hid , the bar where people were massacred , the field that people tried to drive through and flee through , the rescuer & ndash ; like the Davidians & ndash ; who came and saved people.Six month later , this conjures up the ghost of the past , the spirit that roam this forest now . Nearby Kibbutz Mefalsim had almost 1,000 resident on October 7 . Like Kfar Aza , it wa a place people wanted to live . The resident in many of these community say that these kibbutz were 95 % heaven and 5 % hell & ndash ; before October 7.Today , many of them are empty and lack resident & ndash ; proud , peace-loving people who were evacuated . At Mefalsim , there is a sign supporting the & ldquo ; Kaplan & rdquo ; protester , the anti-Netanyahu camp . These kibbutz are proud of their heritage . In a small building housing the archive of Mefalsim , there is a photo of the bolt-action rifle acquired by the Jewish state via Czechoslovakia in 1948 that helped defend Israel.On October 7 , the member of the security team , using modern rifle , defended this community successfully from the terrorist . In many case , the terrorist assigned group of 30-40 men to attack each border community . When they didn & rsquo ; t succeed in some place , there wa no second wave . When they did succeed , such a breaking into Kfar Aza , wave of men came from Gaza to loot and murder.In Sderot , terrorist shot upon entry , firing bullet at the street , targeting the police station in a battle that went on for hour into the night . The building eventually burned down . Residents had to hide indoors for several day amidst fear that infiltrator were still inside . Eventually , the city of 30,000 wa evacuated . Six month later , it recovered a lot : many resident returned , and there were even traffic jam downtown . But the sign of war remain & ndash ; soldier stand at the city entrance , checking cars.In Ofakim , around 30 minute away from Gaza by car , one particular neighborhood saw an intense gunfight ; more than two dozen people were killed in different incident . In total , around 50 resident of the city were killed , some in a bus for retiree that wa traveling to the Dead Sea from Ofakim through Sderot . The bus wa attacked , and the people were killed . Police officer in Ofakim were killed a well . In one neighborhood , the terrorist attacked several home . Residents helped defend the city and eventually , the terrorist were hunted down.Back on the border with Nirim , the small , 240-person community , it is quiet , but eerily so , like a ghost town . The kibbutz minimarket ha been reopened , and the customer are mostly soldier who come over from unit stationed nearby . Several green parrot inhabit a tree , apparently escaped pet . Other former pet are wandering around , including a cat that wouldn & rsquo ; t stop following me . Wild dog had infiltrated from Gaza on October 7 , following the marauding looters.In contrast to Sderot and Nova , field of memory , Nirim is almost deserted , the burned home on one side of the kibbutz unchanged since October 7 , cleared on October 10 and 11 of bodies.In the background , like a whisper , ring concern about what come next in Gaza , with the IDF decision to pull out Battalion 98 , though the military remains steadfast in it goal , holding a a stark symbol of a lack of strategy , a symbol that haunt these roads.I drive back along the 232 , the same road the terrorist would have driven on ; it is quiet today . Six month ago , this wa a road of death . No matter how much the field are full of green today , and the orchard of orange are pregnant with fruit , this place will always hold the massacre it witnessed . & nbsp ;","reporter 's notebook : the gaza border , six month after oct . 7"

A hearing on the issue before the Supreme Court that had been scheduled for this coming Tuesday ha been postponed until February 15 . El Halabi ha vehemently denied the charge and accused the prosecution and the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) of manufacturing charge , coercing a confession to undermine humanitarian organization in Gaza and dragging out the case . To date , only the defendant ha been criticizing the prosecution , with the state refraining from responding publicly due to concern about revealing classified intelligence . El Halabi wa indicted in August 2016 for channeling $ 7.2 million a year to Hamas to buy weapon and build attack tunnel . The money wa to have been used by World Vision for food , humanitarian assistance and aid program for disabled child . Neither World Vision nor an Australian government audit found the wrongdoing allegedly uncovered by the Shin Bet . Meanwhile , Israel is trying to convince the International Criminal Court and country in Europe that it legal system is legitimate and fair to avoid war-crimes trial and combat charge of apartheid from Amnesty International and others . Closing argument for the prosecution started last spring , but like much of the case , they dragged out for unclear reason until October . Last March , the Justice Ministry indicated it would release key point of it closing argument to the public in response to some of the defendant & rsquo ; s allegation that his right had been abused . Ultimately , the ministry decided not to release any information and to postpone that issue at the court & rsquo ; s discretion a part of the verdict . Though the ministry claim the court postponed any disclosure , it usually is the prosecution that request gag order in the first place . Since last March , more allegation have emerged from El Halabi & rsquo ; s side . One is that he wa fooled by an undercover informant in detention into confirming detail that the informant kept pressuring El Halabi to confirm . According to the defense , El Halabi told law-enforcement official the confession wa coerced from the first moment they raised it with him . The original document recording the confession wa lost by the police . The defense ha said the case should have been dismissed in light of the circumstance in which the confession wa given . The police record of what wa said is an inauthentic photocopy , raising question of a police cover-up , it said . In addition , the defense ha claimed that World Vision did not transfer any material to Gaza at some of the crossing point where the prosecution say El Halabi made illegal transfer to Hamas . Although these allegation are new to the public , the prosecution ha been aware of them and responded to them behind closed door throughout the trial , the Post ha learned . The prosecution & rsquo ; s response are classified at this stage , but the prosecution apparently acknowledges having used an undercover informant and would say this is a standard approved tactic and that no illegal pressure wa applied . Moreover , the prosecution would point out that the court had already rejected any allegation of a coerced confession earlier in the case and that the only question left for it to settle is how much weight to give the confession . Regarding the allegation of a lost document , it appears the prosecution would likely express regret and reject any conspiracy theory , adding that this is not the first case such an error occurred and that the defense ha not flagged any specific issue to invalidate the authenticity of the copy of the confession . Regarding the border crossing , the prosecution would respond that El Halabi wa a clever operator and sometimes used different organization or name to move material , while using World Vision a his main laundering tool . Last March , Khalil El Halabi told the Post Mohammad El Halabi had & ldquo ; brought conclusive evidence and testimony of the employee of the organization and internal and external international auditor , a well a contractor and even farmer , who all testified that there wa no diversion of any fund from the activity of the organization . & rdquo ; El Halabi said this show that allegation regarding his son misappropriating humanitarian fund for Hamas were unfounded . Further , he said , & ldquo ; At least three defense expert confirmed that the existing & lsquo ; evidence & rsquo ; is clearly unreliable and untrue & hellip ; based on limited preliminary examination only & hellip ; Due to the confidentiality imposed on me by the state , I am not allowed to comment on the nature of the evidence . & rdquo ; According to Khalil El Halabi , the defense ha called three expert witness , likely relating to finance or auditing , a well a employee of World Vision , contractor and farmer involved with how the NGO & rsquo ; s fund were spent . The defense also claim it did not see all of the evidence . The prosecution would say El Halabi used tactic such a falsifying documentation or concealing the use of certain fund using other entity to hide his use of World Vision a a financial laundering instrument , just a he did with physical transfer of mat & eacute ; riel for Hamas , the Post ha learned . Further , the prosecution ha said even though the public ha not seen the full evidence , the defense ha . Both side accuse the other of unconscionable delay relating to fighting over how the trial would take place , what evidence the defense would get to see and the possibility in the earlier year of reaching a plea deal .",u state dept . closely monitoring world vision case verdict

2021-05-06 22:12:55.873,jpost,"& nbsp ; Fakhri Abu Diab life in east Jerusalem , but everything he know about Israel & rsquo ; s capital is different from the one that his Jewish neighbor love . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Anyone who come to east Jerusalem know that it is not the same city and not the same language , & rdquo ; said Abu Diab , who is a spokesman for the Silwan neighborhood . & nbsp ; The barrier that once divided Jerusalem prior to 1967 ha long since been torn down . Fifty-four year have passed since Israel created a united capital when it wrested control of the eastern part of the city from Jordan during the Six Day War . & nbsp ; Next week , a Israel celebrates Jerusalem Day to mark that victory , few will remember where that barrier really stood , but the scar of the division still resonate in the city . & nbsp ; At issue are not just the cultural and linguistic difference between the Palestinian population that largely life in east Jerusalem and make up 39 % of the municipality & rsquo ; s 900,000 people . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Geopolitics play a role . Most of the international community support a divided Jerusalem , where the eastern part of the city would be the capital of a future Palestinian state . An additional complicating factor is the fact that most of the Palestinians have Jerusalem residency but lack Israeli citizenship . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; But over time , for many Jewish Israelis , the difference have almost begun to appear cosmetic . They walked around a city that easily look united and whose redivision seems unrealistic and unfeasible . & nbsp ; For Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Deputy Mayor Fleur Hassan-Nahoum the city & rsquo ; s unity is obvious . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Jerusalem is a city comprised of community . That is the essence of Jerusalem . It is a city of community , but it is a united city . What make it united ? You have one municipal authority taking care of all of it resident , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; That authority is in charge of transport , health , education and public space , she added . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; That municipal authority , especially in the last few year , ha made it a point of being an inclusive authority , where everyone ha a voice , and where everyone can approach the mayor and the deputy mayor and can advocate for their community and receive resource for that community , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; On a public level , what we have seen in the last five to 10 year is a city that is more integrated than it ha ever been . Ten year ago , you never had a young Arab student working in Fox , & rdquo ; Hassan-Nahoum said , adding that many of the shop throughout the city are staffed by Arab resident . & nbsp ; Today , public space is shared by Jewish and Arab resident of the city , including in coffee shop and gym . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Whether people admit it or not , whether the detractor can still point finger at the divided city & ndash ; in essence , in the day-to-day experience for most people , & rdquo ; the city is integrated physically , logistically and relationally , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t think our work is finished , & rdquo ; she said , adding that more need to be done on issue of equity and job placement , particularly in the hi-tech industry , but that is true with respect to any community that ha been marginalized , she said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; For many year the government of Israel , whether left or right , did not know what to do with the issue of east Jerusalem , Hassan-Nahoum said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The Left think one day it will be the capital of a Palestinian state , and the right wing is concerned with other issue , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Partially , she said , the problem lay with the Palestinians themselves . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We had a hostile community , with little leadership , manipulated by the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah . It wa difficult . I am not saying it wa all their fault , but I believe we are in a different place now . The Arabs in east Jerusalem are realizing that they are getting zero , nothing , from the Palestinian leadership , she said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; She credited Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion and former Jerusalem Affairs minister Ze & rsquo ; ev Elkin , now a New Hope MK , for making stride in closing the equity gap between Jewish and Arab resident of the city , including the development of partnership with the local Arab leadership . & nbsp ; When riot broke out a few week ago , Lion , who is Sabbath observant , walked on Saturday to meet with community leader to seek a way to calm the situation , she said . & nbsp ; The city & rsquo ; s unity wa most clearly apparent , she said , during the COVID-19 pandemic , when everyone banded together to fight a common enemy . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It wa beautiful . It wa a difficult time , but we came together a a city and that is the measure of how far we have come , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The DNA of Jerusalem is one of diversity , & rdquo ; she said , a she explained that King David chose this space to build this city 3,000 year ago because it did not belong to any one tribe and thus it could be a place where everyone could gather together . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Our DNA is one of convergence , of east and west , of old and new , of past and future and heaven and earth . We will solve all of the conflict in our country and in our region from Jerusalem , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; THE EXECUTIVE director of the left-wing NGO Ir Amim , Yudith Oppenheimer , said that , factually speaking , Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967 and since then it ha been managed by one municipality . & nbsp ; On the surface , & ldquo ; you can look at Jerusalem and say here is an urban space in which people can move from one place to another , so maybe this is a united city , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer said . & nbsp ; But & ldquo ; when you look deeper into the situation , you see that the city is actually divided in many aspect , and each one portrays a picture of two very unequal society , in which one control the other , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer added . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; One side ha all the resource and is very dedicated to expressing it hegemony , & rdquo ; and the other side lack those resource , she said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The issue , she said , start with the fact that most of the city & rsquo ; s Palestinian resident lack Israeli citizenship and have only residency right . Those right are conditional and can easily be removed , she explained , adding that this insecure status dominates many aspect of their life , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Everything is conditional . They may not leave the city ; they may lose their residency status . They can not build in the city , but they have to live in the city , or they lose all their entitlement to the city , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer said . & nbsp ; Palestinians have individual right in Jerusalem but not collective one , she said . & nbsp ; Oppenheimer dismissed claim that the Palestinians are to blame for this situation because they refused to take citizenship . & ldquo ; This is an urban legend , & rdquo ; she said . Palestinians were never offered collective citizenship , but rather the right to apply individually and that application is very complicated . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It take year and many are denied , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Those who do not want citizenship should be offered permanent residency that can not be easily revoked , so that they can live their life more securely , she said . & nbsp ; The issue of inequity is the main issue , she said , and that issue is separate from the final political status of Jerusalem , which need to be negotiated between Israelis and Palestinians , she explained . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; So is the city united ? & rdquo ; she asked . It & rsquo ; s those who speak so highly of unity that seem to want it the least , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Do they really want for Jerusalem to be united in a meaningful way , in the full meaning of what it mean ? Because their action actually say the opposite , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Her organization , she said , support a two-state resolution to the conflict in which Jerusalem would be the capital of both an Israeli and a Palestinian state . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; But this doesn & rsquo ; t mean that the city ha to be physically divided , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; It is getting more and more difficult to divide the city . If you ask , the majority of the resident actually enjoy the diversity that the city offer and do not want to see the city divided again . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; There are creative way to create two capital without physically dividing the city , and the sustainability of a two-state solution depends on the capacity of Israelis and Palestinians to share the municipal public space in the fullest way possible , Oppenheimer said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The issue is not about dividing the city but about sharing it , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We are actually working very hard not for a vision of divided or united , but for a vision of shared city , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Abu Diab said it is clear to him that the city is divided . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The food is different , even the dream are different , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Here they [ Palestinians ] know they are living under occupation , & rdquo ; said Abu Diab who doe not consider himself unified with the Jewish resident of the city . & ldquo ; We think they are not living with u and that they want to live without u , & rdquo ; he added . & nbsp ; He ha never sought Israeli citizenship , nor doe he want it . He dream of being a citizen of a future Palestinian state in which east Jerusalem will be it capital . But this doesn & rsquo ; t mean he imago that a wall would divide the city , but , rather , that the city would be governed by two different entity , with it citizen walking freely between both . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Jerusalem belongs to everyone . It should be a city of love and peace and nonviolence . It should be an international city , but allow for everyone to be part of their own people , & rdquo ; he explained . & nbsp ; SARA HAETZNI-COHEN , who chair the right-wing NGO My Israel Movement , said that obviously Jerusalem is Israel & rsquo ; s united capital and , a such , all effort must be made to ensure that this is true in practice and not just a slogan . & nbsp ; To make that happen , she said , the issue of inequity between the eastern and western part of the city must be addressed and it must be the Right that lead that charge . & nbsp ; Failure to do that , she said , give an erroneous message that Israeli sovereignty in east Jerusalem is temporary . There is little reason to invest in neighborhood that will one day be given away . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Israel ha to make a statement of sovereignty by normalizing it treatment of those neighborhood , including offering Israeli citizenship to the Palestinians who seek it , she said . & nbsp ; Otherwise , Palestinians have the feeling they are temporary here , Haetzni-Cohen said . & nbsp ; From the start , Israel made a decision to apply sovereignty to the city , and now it should shore up that sovereignty , she said . & nbsp ; To not recognize this reality , she said , is to & ldquo ; put one & rsquo ; s head in the sand . & rdquo ;","jerusalem day : 54 year later , is the city united or divided ?"

The discussion illustrates China & rsquo ; s growing role in the Middle East.After China helped broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran , it appeared that Beijing could solve many problem by posing a an outsider with no real agenda or baggage.China & rsquo ; s foreign minister indicated that Beijing could play a role in Israel-Palestinian peace talk , according to report last week . He had separate call with Israel and the Palestinians , The Guardian reported . & ldquo ; The separate phone call between the Chinese foreign minister , Qin Gang , and the Israeli and Palestinian top diplomat come amid recent move by Beijing to position itself a a regional mediator , & rdquo ; the report said.According to an article at Al-Ain medium in the UAE , for many year , & ldquo ; China maintained good relation with the Palestinians and the Israelis , but it did not present itself a a mediator to resolve the conflict between the two party . & rdquo ; China ha now played a role bringing Saudi Arabia and Iran together , however , so why not tackle another area of tension , the report said . & ldquo ; Israel considers the United States to be the exclusive mediator in it conflict with the Palestinians , and ha always rejected European , UN and Russian mediation , & rdquo ; it said.It appears the Palestinians think the Chinese might play a positive role . This wa raised by Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki last week . However , China is now perceived a a rival by the US , and Washington ha been clear to Israel and other country that they should be wary of China & rsquo ; s influence , especially a that might relate to sensitive technology.This is at the heart of several controversy over the year , such a China investing in port or communication . Because Israel ha such close tie to the US and Israeli defense company have many US partner , there is an increased spotlight on China & rsquo ; s role in the region . In fact , China & rsquo ; s growing influence in Israel appeared to peak a few year ago.China is reaching out to the Palestinians . Beijing say it support the PA , seek to continue assisting the Palestinians and back the two-state solution . The Chinese said they would welcome visit by Palestinian officials.So how would China facilitate peace talk with Israel and the Palestinians ? SO HOW would China facilitate peace talk with Israel and the Palestinians ? Considering how China signed a 25-year deal with Iran recently , is it an impartial actor today ? The global shift that are taking place in the wake of COVID and Russia & rsquo ; s invasion of Ukraine may have changed thing so much that Beijing would find it to be an uphill struggle these days.Nevertheless , China appeared to have message discipline on this issue . It ha spoken to Israel and the Palestinians . Chinese President Xi Jinping appears serious . There are several way this could develop , and China could try to mediate more and play a larger role.This will put Israel in an awkward position . If Israel appears to not be interested , it could cause China to see Israel in a negative light and begin to invest more in tie with the Palestinians and Iran . Tehran ha interest here a well . Iran & rsquo ; s agenda is to undermine the PA and spread chaos in the Palestinian city via weapon smuggling.China is officially against militant , terrorist and chaos . Beijing claim to want stability in the region , and it want deal between party in conflict so that it can develop trade relations.China ha been talking up it Belt and Road Initiative for year . This wa supposed to knit the region together in economic term . However , once again , the Russian war in Ukraine and US-China tension have changed thing . Russia & rsquo ; s war accelerates process in international relation , which mean it accelerates China & rsquo ; s confrontation with the West.Despite France & rsquo ; s outreach , Beijing is indicating it support Moscow undermining the global rules-based international order . Beijing continues to make comment about the Baltic state that cause dismay in the West.On the other hand , a the Belt and Road Initiative may not be a important these day , because the world is more divided , and China & rsquo ; s soft , quiet and consistent approach to influence building in the region ha shifted , it & rsquo ; s not clear if the economic-stability model is even relevant.For instance , for many year , we were told that linking Russia & rsquo ; s economy to Europe would reduce the chance of war . In the end , this globalization neoliberal agenda failed because China and Russia have shown that despite economic link , they have become more nationalist , authoritarian and hostile to the West.Thus , democratic peace or Belt and Road have not come to fruition . Therefore , how will China & rsquo ; s talk of brokering peace deal come to fruition ? For China , the role of mediator is bolstered by it not having a major historic role in the region . On the other hand , it suffers from declining perception of neutrality in the region a it play a greater role here . That mean country all pour into China their hope and belief of what it might be to the region , and a with all diminishing return and feedback loop , it will inevitably come up short because you can & rsquo ; t be all thing to all people.The region ha a history of having expectation and then being angry when they aren & rsquo ; t met . At the same time , China doesn & rsquo ; t have a long historic track record of mediation or solving conflict . The US , despite it baggage , doe have a long role of helping end conflict . This go back more than 100 year , when Teddy Roosevelt & rsquo ; s administration helped end the Russo-Japanese War.China & rsquo ; s track record closer to home at ending conflict doe not bode well for peacemaking in the region . A more powerful China is clearly rising , and it is willing to take risk , such a working with the Saudis and Iranians . That may not mean that what it achieved in those talk can be replicated .",could china serve a broker of israel-palestinian peace ? - analysis

He is a true disciple of the late Meir Kahane , who advocated the transfer of all Arabs out of Israel . No one should ignore the writing on the wall.Israeli designer who worked for Roberto Cavalli ■ SEVERAL LEADING Israeli fashion designer worked for Roberto Cavalli , the iconic Italian designer who died last week.Among the first wa Tamara Yovel Jones , who maintained a close friendship and professional relationship with him until his dying day.Not only that , but in her capacity a head of the fashion design unit at Shenkar and Bezalel , she sent some of her more talented student to Milan & nbsp ; to be inspired by Cavalli , who had a very positive attitude toward Israel and Israelis & ndash ; particularly Israeli woman whom he admired both for their beauty and their strength.In November 2011 , when Motty Reif , who inter alia is a well-known producer of fashion show , decided to revive Israel Fashion Week but called it Tel Aviv Fashion Week , Cavalli came to inject additional glamour by opening the event with a new collection of his own.The revived Fashion Week , after a very long hiatus , did not have the extravaganza that had been the highlight of opening of Israel Fashion Weeks in the 1970s and 1980s , when the late Lea Gottlieb , the founder of Gottex , and her star model , the late statuesque and sensual Tami Ben Ami , provided opening night viewer with a glittering mix of Las Vegas , Paris , and Milan . Gottlieb had an innate sense of drama , which wa reflected both in her design and in her fashion show , though she herself wore modest classics.Although there definitely is a sense of glamour in the show produced by Reif , it is more low-key and geared to commerce more than entertainment . Aside from that , there is very little new in fashion today . Innovation resides more in technology than in style . In fact , perusal of fashion publication of the second half of the 1960s prof that what go around come around . The design are exceedingly similar to those paraded on fashion runway today.When Cavalli came to Tel Aviv in 2011 , Tel Aviv Fashion Week , of which he wa the key attraction , wa naturally launched at the residence of the Italian ambassador , who at that time wa Luigi Mattiolo . Among the guest were Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai , international fashion model and actress Noa Tishby , and fashion designer Gideon Oberson , whose beachwear range wa the closest rival to Gottex.In their heyday , Israel Fashion Weeks were the country & rsquo ; s best mean of image promotion , attracting hundred of overseas buyer along with writer of leading fashion magazine and newspaper . The design were eye-catching , and the Israeli model were tall , beautiful , and graceful.One of the reason that Reif wanted to revive Fashion Week wa that , just under a decade earlier , he had completed his term a cultural attach & eacute ; to the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles , where he wa extremely conscious of how Israel wa perceived . He wanted to promote the beautiful lifestyle image of Israel rather than the military one . The more tension there wa in the Middle East , the more Israel & rsquo ; s military image came to the fore.There is no doubt that Cavalli helped Reif to get Tel Aviv Fashion Week off the ground , and for that Israel & rsquo ; s fashion industry is deeply in debt to himBatman writer sign letter calling for the return of Bibas family & nbsp ; ■ A FONDNESS for the enduring Batman character , who first appeared in comic in 1939 , had the entire Bibas family of Kibbutz Nir Oz dressed in some semblance of Batman for Purim 2024 . On October 7 , 2023 , they were among the hostage taken by Hamas to Gaza.In late November , Hamas said that 10-month-old Kfir Bibas , his four-year-old brother , Ariel , and their mother , Shiri , had been killed , but provided no proof to the claim.There is video evidence that they were alive when taken to Gaza , and the hope in Israel is that despite the inhuman condition to which the hostage are subjected , the family is still alive.A petition organized by the David S . Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies , in Washington , DC , and sent to Sheikh Meshal bin Hamad Al Thani , the ambassador of Qatar , and Motaz Zahran , the ambassador of Egypt , ha been signed by more than 50 writer , artist , and editor associated with the iconic Batman character . The petition urge the two envoy to Washington to press for the release of Ariel.The signatory on the letter include many of the most renowned comic creator involved with the Batman franchise . & ldquo ; Every hostage is equally important , but naturally Batman writer and artist feel a special connection to this young Bat-fan and his family , & rdquo ; said Dr . Rafael Medoff , historian and director of the institute . & ldquo ; These comic creator have spent decade developing a hero who fight for the innocent and stand a a beacon of hope for his community , and we & rsquo ; re trying to channel that spirit through this effort . & rdquo ; Tweeting the Iranian drone attack on Jerusalem ■ FORMER US ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk tweeted during the Iranian assault on Israel : From what one can see on CNN , Iran & rsquo ; s drone and missile are targeting Jerusalem ! That ha almost never happened before , because of the sanctity of the Holy City for Muslims . Maybe Iran doesn & rsquo ; t value Al Quds in the same way.It wa pointed out to him , in reply , that Jerusalem ha been targeted several time , but , a can be expected , on the whole Jewish people agreed with him , and Muslims did not .

The two don & rsquo ; t agree on everything and argue a lot , but in a fairly civilized manner , which make the interview more interesting . What they have in common , other than their attitude to Israel , are their beautifully modulated British accent . Both are Oxford alumnus , and both are journalist and authors.Khamenei give Netanyahu a lifeline & nbsp ; ■ DESPITE ALL the rhetoric and the missile bombardment last Saturday night , one ha to wonder whether Iran & rsquo ; s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei actually want to keep Benjamin Netanyahu in office , in accordance with the old adage & ldquo ; Better the devil you know than the one you don & rsquo ; t . & rdquo ; Netanyahu & rsquo ; s waning popularity & ndash ; even in right-wing circle & ndash ; suddenly reversed in his favor a his year of warning about the Iranian threat leaped from obsession to reality . This wa Bibi & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; Aha ! I told you so & rdquo ; moment.Though presumably a concerned a anyone else in Israel , he & rsquo ; s unlikely to send Khamenei a thank-you note , but there & rsquo ; s little doubt that Khamenei gave him a lifeline , though in doing so the ayatollah lost some of his own clout and wa widely castigated in the international community.If anything good came out of the Iranian belligerence , it wa the digital traffic of the overseas relative and friend of ten of thousand of Israeli resident , who all wanted to be sure that the recipient of their message were all right . The widespread concern of people living in different time zone and country wa amazing and heartwarming . It wa also a sign that when Israel is in trouble , Diaspora Jews rally to help physically , morally , emotionally , and financially . When we speak of ourselves a brother and sister , it may sound trite , but it happens to be true.Kaori Matsutomi and Israel & nbsp ; ■ OF COURSE , it & rsquo ; s not just Jews who care .

She ha maintained contact with several of them & ndash ; particularly since October 7 , and again since the Iranian missile blast last weekend.She enjoyed her time in Israel and would like to come back.Meanwhile , Japan & rsquo ; s Ministry of Foreign Affairs ha announced that Koichi Mizushima , Japan & rsquo ; s most recent ambassador to Israel , ha been appointed a his country & rsquo ; s envoy to South Korea . This will be Mizushima & rsquo ; s second stint in Seoul , where he previously served a a minister . His new appointment became effective immediately.Israel-Poland diplomatic exchange & nbsp ; ■ THOUGH JAPAN is quick to send successor , Poland is still dragging it heel in sending a new ambassador to Israel . Marek Magierowski , who wa the last Polish ambassador to serve here , wa recalled in August 2021 and sent to Washington . Thirteen month ago , following a diplomatic semi-freeze , Poland announced that it wa sending an ambassador.In the spirit of the revival of mutual diplomatic exchange , Israel did send an ambassador in the person of Yacov Livne , who is currently having a very tough time because some people on Poland & rsquo ; s extreme Right are accusing Israel of deliberately murdering Damien Sobol , the Polish victim of an accidental shooting of worker of the World Central Kitchen.Taiwan : Israel 's constant friend & nbsp ; ■ NONETHELESS , A lot of the animus leveled at Israel for refusal to call a ceasefire ha subsided since Iran attempted to make good on it threat against Israel.Among the constant friend of Israel is Taiwan , whose President Tsai Ing-wen met this week with a cross-party Knesset delegation led by Yesh Atid MK Boaz Toporovsky , who chair the Israel-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group.Members of the delegation included MKs Boaz Bismuth , Vladimir Beliak , and Matti Sarfatti-Harcavi , who were accompanied to the president & rsquo ; s office by Maya Yaron , representative of the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei.Tsai commented that bilateral interaction between Taiwan and Israel have recently been very close . She indicated that in addition to regular dialogue on energy , the environment , and the economy , Taiwan and Israel have signed agreement to strengthen exchange in education , public health , tourism , and other domains.Tsai added that she look forward to Taiwan and Israel leveraging their industrial strength and continuing to deepen their partnership , based on their shared value of freedom and democracy , to jointly build more resilient global supply chains.Tsai also expressed her sincere concern and sympathy following Iran & rsquo ; s attack on Israel and condemned the use of violence to undermine global peace and stability.She thanked the delegation for it support of Taiwan and expressed appreciation to Toporovsky for his active promotion of cooperation on youth education and humanitarian aid between Taiwan and Israel , and his consistent support on social medium and in op-eds for Taiwan & rsquo ; s participation in international forums.Referring to Israel a an important global hub for start-ups , Tsai said that Taiwan & rsquo ; s Industrial Technology Research Institute , Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency , and major manufacturer are all eager to explore opportunity to further cooperate with Israel.Toporovsky called Taiwan & ldquo ; a beacon of democratic and liberal value & rdquo ; and commended Tsai a & ldquo ; a beacon of democratic and liberal leadership . & rdquo ; He offered Israel & rsquo ; s condolence for the loss of life and injury after the earthquake in eastern Taiwan , noting that the Taiwanese once again showed the world their resilience and strength.He also spoke of the security situation in the Middle East and of the challenge confronting Israel . In this context he said that Israel will always remember Taiwan & rsquo ; s support after the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7 , and by Iran last weekend.Australian attachment to the Arava ■ THE AUSTRALIANS are coming .

2024-05-15 16:36:15.317,jpost,"Since the outbreak of war between Ukraine and Russia on February 24 , 2022 , a staggering 83,198 Olim from Russia have sought refuge in Israel , a reported by the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration . According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics , this influx is part of a broader pattern that ha seen approximately 1.3 million Russian speaker settle in Israel , making up 15 % of the nation 's population & mdash ; a demographic that includes those from other post-Soviet states.However , the transition to Israeli life ha not been seamless for many . Struggling with cultural and religious assimilation , these newcomer often experience profound isolation and loneliness . As their adjustment hurdle persist well into their second year , the urgency to address their integration challenge becomes increasingly apparent.For more story from The Media Line , go to themedialine.org.To gain insight into their situation , The Media Line recently spoke to Rabbi Binyamin Minich , a Russian `` war aliyah `` expert from the Daniel community in Jaffa who frequently interacts with new Israeli citizen from the post-Soviet region . `` Surely , repatriate from the post-Soviet space encounter difficulty integrating into Israel . Although everyone ha ' returned home , ' the immigrant crisis remains . People find it difficult from a financial point of view . First and foremost , everyone want to eat , not to pray . Then come the crisis of culture and language , `` admits Rabbi Minich . `` It 's impossible to be fully Israeli without being born here . And therefore , the crisis will always exist , `` he adds.The rabbi call the current weakness in integrating Russian repatriate a failure of the multicultural approach . `` People think that because there is a huge Russian-speaking diaspora here , they can settle without much effort . This is not the case . Despite Israel 's liberalism , there are cultural and religious code here , even among the most secular citizen , `` note Minich.Challenges Russian immigrant face in IsraelDasha Shkolnikova , a 28-year-old Russian immigrant , speaks about the difficulty many face while integrating into Israeli society . `` A fundamental mistake that many make is closing themselves off . Israel is not the right kind of country for that . You have to go out and socialize ; everything here is designed for you always to be outside . Nobody stay at home , and that 's the culture , `` say Shkolnikova . `` Many people from Russia left involuntarily , and in their mind , it 's ' I fled . ' They only communicate with Russians , & rdquo ; she add , & ldquo ; and it turn into a real Bat Yam ( an Israeli city popular among Russians ) , almost a ghetto . & rdquo ; Journalist Ilya Egorov echo that experience . `` I literally fled to Israel with just one suitcase because I wa on a business trip . Then I somehow managed to get the document transferred and repatriated . `` & nbsp ; `` I rented some apartment and just closed myself off on the balcony every day , opened Zoom , and communicated with my colleague and friend who remained in Russia . Honestly , apart from one business trip , I have n't even been to Jerusalem , `` admits Egorov.In addition , many immigrant from the post-Soviet space feel nostalgic for their country of origin . Russians may feel their identity and culture are being threatened . `` There 's a huge layer of Russian shop and event here , & rdquo ; say Shkolnikova . & ldquo ; You can find basically everything . But many thing feel unfamiliar here because it 's the East . For example , everyone here is very tactile , and for someone from the post-Soviet space , this is very unusual . `` `` I feel that this life & mdash ; a if it 's not mine , and mine stayed in Russia , & rdquo ; Egorov add . & ldquo ; I can beat my chest and shout , I 'm Jewish , I 'm Israeli , but I 'm only Israeli because I have a passport . `` At the same time , he want to learn the language and feel like an Israeli . Egorov admires the Israeli mentality and the resilience of people in the face of difficulty and war . `` Nowadays , I keenly feel antisemitism in the world , and I believe I have the right to say that it directly affect me too , `` he says.Rabbi Minich explains that the Jewish self-awareness of many repatriate change after moving to Israel , which make their integration harder . `` Perhaps in the country of origin , they felt like Jews , and no one objected to that , but in Israel , they are reminded that they are not by matrilineal descent , and therefore - ' not truly Jewish , ' `` say Minich.His word are confirmed by Polina Altzitser , a 25-year-old language teacher who wa repatriated to Israel from Russia in April 2022 due to the start of the war in Ukraine . `` Although I have Jewish root , no one in my family supported Jewish tradition at all , unfortunately . We did n't talk about it . I always knew my grandfather wa Jewish , but we never emphasized that , `` she explains . `` I see strong discrimination here against those who are n't Jews , according to halacha ( Biblical law in Judaism ) . It greatly upset and anger me . I do n't understand what the problem is . Why , for example , ca n't you get married without some certificate stating that your mother is Jewish ? I faced this when I started dating my boyfriend , and it 's been difficult for me , `` confesses Polina . `` It 's a secular but , at the same time , very religious country . When it come to family , tradition , and everything else , I clearly feel a lack of knowledge because my family is not entirely Jewish , & rdquo ; say Shkolnikova . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; You must get used to the tradition and understand them , & rdquo ; she add thoughtfully . & ldquo ; Living in a different world , you can not cut yourself off from it and continue to live a if you were in Russia . Why are you here if you do so ? `` Rabbi Minich share that besides being liberal , his community is also multilingual and multipolitical , where not only Jews of matrilineal descent but also child , grandchild , and spouse of Jews are welcomed . `` I believe less in the concept of Russian-speaking synagogue because , ultimately , I think it 's impossible to avoid the side effect of ghettoization . Therefore , my community is completely Israeli ; they speak six different language , `` Minich shares.Repatriates also emphasize the importance of language . `` I immediately enrolled in ulpan ( Hebrew language school ) ; I just knew it wa necessary . Language is the DNA of a people and culture . If you do n't have the language , assimilating will be much harder for you , `` say Shkolnikova.Ulpan is a big step but not always a complete solution . `` Ninety percent of my surroundings remain Russian-speaking , & rdquo ; say Alzitser . That 's why Hebrew is so difficult for me . The problem is that I still ca n't fully accept that I need the language . I ca n't say I 've completely abandoned my past and understanding of myself a Russian . & rdquo ; Minich belief that despite all the difficulty , those repatriate who stay in Israel will significantly contribute to the development of Israeli society . `` Israel is a complex country , and living here is n't easy . Those who are comfortable in Israel ultimately dedicate themselves to the country and make it better , `` he say . `` Immigration is always challenging . And the least we can do for those who have just arrived is to help them feel at home , `` Minich concludes .",isolated amid independence day : russian immigrant face israeli integration issue
2021-07-29 20:42:04.757,jpost,"The UN Security Council must pressure Israel to halt the pending eviction of 3,000 Palestinians living in east Jerusalem including in & nbsp ; Sheikh Jarrah , Ir Amim executive-director Yehudith Oppenheimer urged in a special briefing she delivered to the 15-member body . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It is therefore essential to hold the Israeli government accountable , and to urge it to prevent the large-scale displacement of these community , & rdquo ; said Oppenheimer , who head an Israeli left-wing NGO that focus almost exclusively on issue relating to east Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Oppenheimer spoke to the UNSC virtually from Jerusalem during it monthly meeting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . She briefly outlined issue relating to the 350,000 Palestinians who are resident of the city , but not citizen of the country . & nbsp ; Since 1967 , & ldquo ; Israeli authority have employed a system of discriminatory policy to weaken the Palestinian hold on the city , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer charged . & ldquo ; These policy have included : land confiscation , settlement [ Jewish ] building , denial of citizenship and political right , permanent residency revocation , insufficient service provision & nbsp ; and severe restriction on planning and building in east Jerusalem . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; But Oppenheimer focused specifically on the fate of four small community in east Jerusalem , where some 3,000 Palestinians are & nbsp ; in danger of losing their home ; Sheikh Jarrah , Batan al-Hawa , Bustan and Walaja . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I am speaking because these measure of Palestinian displacement have recently increased in scope and scale in an unprecedented manner , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer said . & nbsp ; At issue are four legal battle ; two involve city plan to build two national park and the others involve landlord-tenant dispute over land ownership and the legality of the home . & nbsp ; The most high-profile dispute ha been the fate of four family in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood , also known a the Shimon HaTzaddik neighborhood . & nbsp ; The four family have appealed to the High Court of Justice to overrule two lower court ruling , which determined that their home are owned by the Nahalat Shimon Company that want to develop the largely Palestinian neighborhood for Jewish housing . & nbsp ; The area had been a Jewish one prior to the 1948 War of Independence when the resident fled . In the aftermath of the war , Palestinians who fled sovereign Israel , including west Jerusalem , moved to that area . & nbsp ; Some 28 family were offered home there in exchange for relinquishing their refugee status . But the land , previously owned by two Jewish company , wa not registered in their name . & nbsp ; The High Court of Justice is expected to hold a hearing on the appeal on Monday . It had initially delayed the hearing to give Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit time to determine if the government wanted to be a party to the case and to render an option . & nbsp ; Mandelblit told the court earlier this month that he saw no reason for the state to intervene , and threw the matter back to the court . & nbsp ; A source told The Jerusalem Post that Prime Minister Naftali Bennett would not order the eviction of the Sheikh Jarrah family . Police have the option to refuse eviction order that might cause a danger to security . & nbsp ; Hamas ha claimed that Sheikh Jarrah is one of the reason that it launched a salvo of rocket at Jerusalem and other town in May , which sparked an 11-day Gaza war . & nbsp ; Bennett & rsquo ; s opposition to the demolition is likely to delay the matter , possibly for a long time , but it could not ultimately subvert the legal process should the High Court rule against the family . & nbsp ; It is believed that the fate of the petition by the four family will determine the fate of the remaining 24 family in the neighborhood at risk of losing their home . & nbsp ; Ambassador to the US and the UN Gilad Erdan attacked Oppenheimer when he addressed the council , charging that she had brought & ldquo ; Hamas & rsquo ; s lie about Jerusalem to the Security Council . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; It & rsquo ; s a move , he said , which & ldquo ; strengthens the terrorist organization and weakens the Palestinian Authority , & rdquo ; and that it is an & ldquo ; absurd & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; dangerous & rdquo ; situation . & nbsp ; Erdan warned that the & ldquo ; Hamas narrative & rdquo ; put forward by Oppenheimer could be used to justify terror attack against Israel . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Today & rsquo ; s discussion might serve to increase Hamas & rsquo ; influence in Jerusalem and the Palestinian arena , & rdquo ; Erdan said . & nbsp ; He charged that Ir Amim had a & ldquo ; long history of spreading distorted claim regarding Israel & rsquo ; s legitimacy and presence in Jerusalem , while ignoring inconvenient fact . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Erdan claimed that more than & ldquo ; half of Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Arab resident would prefer Israeli citizenship to Palestinian citizenship . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Far from being displaced , Erdan said , & ldquo ; Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Arab population ha increased by over 400 % since Jerusalem wa reunited in 1967 . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; An Ir Amim briefing to the council , he said , is & ldquo ; a absurd a bringing a leader of the Yellow Vests protest to give an & lsquo ; objective & rsquo ; briefing on the French Government & rsquo ; s economic policy . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Neither the NGO nor the Security Council can undermine the & ldquo ; millennia-old connection between the Jewish People and it eternal capital of Jerusalem . & rdquo ; He added , & ldquo ; We will always keep that promise . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Despite & ldquo ; false claim to the contrary , we will never accept the delegitimization of our legal , historical and national right in Jerusalem , by the Security Council or any other international body , & rdquo ; Erdan said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Successive Israeli government had framed these case a standard property dispute , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer explained to the UNSC , but that in reality they were & ldquo ; systematic campaign & rdquo ; aimed at changing the demographic makeup of east Jerusalem . This is done by uprooting Palestinian family and supplanting them with Jewish enclave within larger Palestinian neighborhood , Oppenheimer said , adding that it & rsquo ; s a situation that creates friction and make normative communal neighborhood life difficult . & nbsp ; The situation is possible because of the discriminatory legal system that allows Jews to reclaim property lost a the result of the 1948 war , but forbids Palestinians from reclaiming property they lost in that war . & nbsp ; The & ldquo ; pretext for many of the demolition are the absence of building permit , which are nearly impossible to procure due to the absence of proper zoning plan that the Israeli authority have failed to advance , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer said . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Many of the family facing eviction are Palestinian refugee who lost home in 1948 , and who now stand to be displaced for a second time , & rdquo ; she claimed . & nbsp ; Oppenheimer also highlighted the case of Batan al-Hawa in Silwan , noting that the court had asked Mandelblit to provide a response by August 29 . The request indicates & ldquo ; a possible understanding that these case have far-reaching political and moral ramification and therefore require & nbsp ; government involvement , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer said , adding that & ldquo ; the Israeli government is now being compelled to take an explicit position on these eviction proceeding . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; That is why international pressure is so important at this juncture , she said . & nbsp ;","pressure israel not to evict 3,000 palestinian , ir amim tell unsc"
2021-10-27 22:17:10.883,jpost,"& ldquo ; Palestinians renew threat to nix agreement with Israel , & rdquo ; read the headline to a story in Wednesday & rsquo ; s Jerusalem Post . According to the story by Khaled Abu Toameh , Palestinian official are threatening to rescind the Oslo Accords , cut off security cooperation and demand one democratic state & ndash ; instead of a two-state solution & ndash ; if Israel doe not recognize an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem a it capital along the pre-1967 line . In addition , the Palestinian leadership ha decided to dispatch envoy to several country urging them to pressure Israel , and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is planning a visit to Russia to get Moscow to do the same and press Israel into committing to a two-state solution . Maybe , in Moscow , an idea first broached in 2007 , a Russian-sponsored international conference on the Middle East , will be floated yet again . Abu Toameh & rsquo ; s story , with a slight change of the name of some of the official quoted inside , could have been written in 2005 , 2010 and 2015 . It is a if time ha stood still , a if the Palestinians have a set diplomatic menu from which they call in an order from time to time . Nothing ha changed . Not the threat to scrap Oslo , stop security cooperation with Israel or lobby the world to step up the pressure on the Jewish state . One staple on that menu that wa not mentioned this time , at least not yet , wa that Abbas would resign , something he ha threatened to do & ndash ; but ha failed to deliver on & ndash ; numerous time in the past . What is clear from these tired threat , and the same old pattern of action & ndash ; saying all signed agreement will be canceled , going to Moscow , threatening to revoke recognition of Israel & ndash ; is that the PA ha no idea what to do next diplomatically . The diplomatic process ha ground to a halt , the Americans & ndash ; realizing that it is not going anywhere right now & ndash ; have pushed it way down their list of priority , and the PA leadership ha no idea of how to further it aim . So it reverts to the default option : threat . THERE ARE two problem with that option , however . The first is that these threat have been issued so often in the past that they simply don & rsquo ; t move anybody . They are empty . And the second problem is that using these threat ha not worked . The PA leadership ha not moved any closer to it goal by threatening to break off agreement with Israel or get an international conference convened . Issuing these threat may serve a domestic political need to flex a muscle from time to time , to show the home audience that the leadership is doing something , but it is having exactly no impact on Israeli policy , and not doing much either in term of mobilizing international involvement . All these threat do is demonstrate that the Palestinian leadership is out of idea . Short of complaining that Israel is an apartheid state committing ethnic cleansing and trying to get the International Criminal Court to step in , it ha no fresh proposition to put forward . Not , mind you , that the Israeli government is bursting with them . But it is trying to put forth a more constructive approach , though others will argue that the recent announcement about a plan to advance construction of more than 3,000 home beyond the Green Line is anything but helpful . Even there , however , that announcement wa preceded by approval of some 1,300 unit for Palestinians in the West Bank , a well a the granting of legal status to some 4,000 Palestinians living there & ndash ; type of & ldquo ; constructive gesture & rdquo ; toward the Palestinians not seen in year . This is all part of an idea that ha taken hold in the Bennett government of & ldquo ; shrinking the conflict , & rdquo ; making life for the Palestinians easier , improving the economic condition in the West Bank , and promoting economic independence there , even while acknowledging that an overall peace settlement is nowhere in the offing . Prime Minister Naftali Bennett ha not taken this idea , developed by Micah Goodman & ndash ; who reportedly ha Bennett & rsquo ; s ear & ndash ; a far a Goodman would like , but it is still something . Goodman & rsquo ; s idea is for more than just an & ldquo ; economic peace , & rdquo ; but actually for Israel to give the Palestinians more area to control , a direction that Yair Lapid could conceivably follow if/when he becomes premier in August 2023 . Even if Bennett is not going a far a Goodman might like , he is still pushing something positive . The PA leadership , on the other hand , is just going back to the same slogan and the same method , vainly hoping that this time they will render a significantly different result . They won & rsquo ; t . Some new idea , new thinking , new approach are badly needed out of Ramallah . The PA need to come up with something better than the & ldquo ; same old , same old , & rdquo ; because that ha proven to be a path leading nowhere .","the palestinian ‘ same old , same old ’ is getting them nowhere - analysis"

2024-03-18 12:02:07.347,jpost,"The government , rabbi , and general public have been at their wit & rsquo ; end arguing about whether and how to encourage haredi ( ultra-Orthodox ) yeshiva student to join the Israel Defense Forces and/or get an academic education to be able to support their family and strengthen the economy.According to newly published research supported by the Edmond de Rothschild Foundation and published in the journal Learning , Culture , and Social Interaction , 93.8 % of haredi student at the Jerusalem College of Technology ( JCT ) described having a positive experience in volunteer programs.Haredi student & rsquo ; participation in volunteer program offered by their college can make other member of their community more inclined to enroll in higher education , the study reveals.The study , led by Dr . Zvika Orr , Prof . Edith Blit-Cohen , Maya Vardi , Bina Beieri , and Prof . Daphna Golan-Agnon , found that student volunteer from underrepresented minority group like Israel & rsquo ; s ultra-Orthodox sector can bridge the gap between academic institution and their community by serving a agent of societal change . & ldquo ; This is the first study to explore community engagement program involving haredi student , and it is our hope that the finding can serve a a template for analyzing student & rsquo ; community engagement among various minority group worldwide , & rdquo ; said Orr , a senior lecturer in the Selma Jelinek School of Nursing at JCT , who , along with Dr . Adi Finkelstein , is the co-founder and co-director of the college & rsquo ; s Lev Bakehila community engagement program.The paper examined response from questionnaire and in-depth qualitative interview with student enrolled at JCT , many of whom are first-generation student . A case study on JCT student contained within the report aimed to show how social engagement can impact minority and underrepresented group navigating the academic world.Student response were based on several volunteer program , including Perah , a volunteer framework in which college student serve a tutor to younger child and provide them with academic and emotional assistance ; Lev Bakehila , where student work to promote the right of people with disability affiliated with Jerusalem & rsquo ; s haredi community ; and the Payis Scholarships and Impact Program , in which student engage in volunteer work in a variety of field and organization , such a school , community center , hospital , and assisted-living facilities.Haredi student volunteer : experience is informative and enriching & ldquo ; Through their community engagement , haredi student act a agent of knowledge and change in their community . Although this process is wrought with challenge and dilemma , the haredi student volunteer described their experience a informative and enriching . This case study illuminates how community engagement can help underrepresented student cope with navigating their community and the academic world , & rdquo ; said Prof . Blit-Cohen of the Paul Baerwald School of Social Work and Social Welfare at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem ( HU ) . Responses from student participating in the study revealed that their community engagement experience helped them bridge the gap between the haredi and academic world . The author said that community engagement serf a a positive catalyst among the ultra-Orthodox because volunteering coincides with one of the basic religious and cultural value practiced in their community , where the prevailing discourse emphasizes charitable and benevolent endeavor , act of loving kindness , and compassion.Additionally , community engagement work helped them foster social change within their community . During their service , they were able to formulate a new perception of social phenomenon and offer this newly adopted perspective within their community . In the interview , those involved in a disability right project , for example , mentioned their sense of commitment to changing social perception about people with disability in their haredi community and beyond.Along with the many well-documented social and academic benefit associated with community engagement , volunteer service also reflects JCT & rsquo ; s institutional commitment not only to excellence on academic and religious level but also to fulfilling the college & rsquo ; s responsibility to make positive contribution to society.The study & rsquo ; s author chose to spotlight haredi student because they are often caught at the crossroad between their community and academia . According to the Central Bureau of Statistics ( CBS ) , in 2020 , only four percent of Israeli student were ultra-Orthodox , less than a third of their share in the college-aged population , and the dropout rate among haredi student is almost three time higher ( 23.9 % ) than the rate among non-haredi Jewish student ( 8.2 % ) . & ldquo ; Given our finding , we are calling for more inclusive community engagement program that reflect and further enhance the diversity in higher education , & rdquo ; Orr concluded . & ldquo ; It appears that the key solution for the optimal integration of haredi student in community engagement program should be understanding the unique need and cultural sensitivity of this community . & rdquo ;",community engagement motivates ultra-orthodox jewish men to pursue higher education - study

2024-06-20 19:25:46.950,jpost,"A 5 % across-the-board budget cut for government ministry wa the main proposal in a series of budget cut laid out at a Finance Ministry meeting on the 2025 budget held Wednesday , Globes said source from the ministry told them.Other proposed cut included pay cut for senior manager in the public sector , postponed raise in the civil service , abolishing unnecessary ministry , and a NIS 2 to 4 billion cut in fund allocated to coalition party - all amounting to NIS 3.5 billion , according to Globes.While the total amount of cut that the ministry make in order to reduce Israel 's deficit is critical to the country 's economic recovery ; given Israel 's political and social climate , the composition of the cut that are made is also critical.Unequal treatmentFlat budget cut across the board for all ministry will likely have significant repercussion for all part of Israel 's society , which could cause widespread frustration if the public doe not think that serious cut to coalition fund , and fund for unnecessary ministry that prop the coalition up are being prioritized over cut that hurt the entire public.The recent controversy over the `` rabbi bill `` and the haredi draft law have highlighted deep discontentment in Israel 's society when it come to the treatment of different sector of society differently and the equal sharing of national burdens.The rabbi bill aim to give the government control over appointment of municipal and neighborhood rabbi , instead of the current system where the city appoint their rabbis.As pointed out in The Jerusalem Post 's editorial on Wednesday , this bill is widely viewed a an attempt by the coalition & rsquo ; s haredi party to appoint it member to position and gain influence over issue of religion and state.Highlighting the sense that this bill is seens a a coalition jobs-grab , Yesh Atid MK Yaron Levi summed up the inequality many felt this bill strengthened . & ldquo ; If the prime minister can approve 1,000 new rabbi , and not 1,000 psychologist , then this place is a piece of trash , `` he said.Public protest of the unequal sharing of the security burden ha also been coming to a head recently a the haredi draft law is advanced with no real solution in sight.The IDF say that they need more manpower , the ultra-Orthodox leadership ha not made concession that would allow for a bill that satisfies this need , and the public fury over this inequality grows with every day that the law is not amended and that more IDF soldier are killed in the Israel-Hamas war and in Israel 's northern conflict with Hezbollah.The 2025 budget may become just another instance of the government 's failing balancing act between coalition pressure and demand by the public to meet the need of the majority of Israelis.This would n't be entirely new . The current government ha already been criticized for how sectoral it allocation of fund ha been and for failing to address this and cut coalition fund when the war necessitated a rethinking of the 2024 budget . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; We found in this budget , that to a much larger extent than in previous coalition agreement , coalition resource were very sectoral , & rdquo ; former Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug told The Jerusalem Post last month . & ldquo ; The fact that they didn & rsquo ; t cut coalition expenditure [ after the outbreak of the war ] that are very sectoral and are not based on professional work substantially undermines the trust in the government . This will make it much harder to come to the public and say & lsquo ; look , there is an additional burden that you will have to incur , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; explained Flug.The Israel-Hamas war ha brought the issue of the unequal burden on Israel 's different sector , long kicked down the road , to a head . Given this and the precarious situation of the coalition , Israel 's budget could potentially be the next crisis that could topple it , or bring the widespread public protest to new boiling points.Public trust in the government ha been stretched and challenged possibly beyond repair since the outbreak of the war , and also in the year prior during the advancement of the judicial overhaul.The budget is another opportunity for the government to try to show the public it is prioritizing the need of the many ; or for it to show that coalition demand are the top of it list of priority . & nbsp ;",is the 2025 budget israel 's next social powder keg ? - analysis

It also show student reading a passage from a fifth-grade Islamic Education textbook that incites violence and Jihad against Israel , per the report.The report also documented several example of teacher at UNRWA school in Gaza praising the attack on social medium , and found tie between Hamas terrorist and UNRWA schools.At least 14 teacher had taken to social medium to praise the massacre , both while the atrocity were still ongoing and week later.Sarah Alderawy , an UNRWA teacher in Gaza , took to Facebook on October 7 to post a video of Hamas terrorist shooting at Israeli car that day .

The report gave several more example of this from 2023 textbook , including excerpt from math and science lesson . In one example , a fourth-grade math problem read : & ldquo ; The number of martyr of the First Intifada ( the Intifada of Rocks ) is 1,392 martyr , and the number of martyr of the Al-Aqsa Intifada is 4,673 .

After Assad regained control of 60 % of the country , the government ha been trying to reassert itself a sovereign and expel Iran and it proxy , including Hezbollah and other Shi & rsquo ; ite militia . As Assad work with Russia , Israel will continue to take advantage of the situation to push Iran out . While Israel & rsquo ; s strongest ally remains the United States , the IDF continues to work with Russia , a key influencer in the Middle East and especially in Syria , where it ha leverage over Assad . In addition to continuing the MABAM , the IDF is advancing plan for a military strike against Iran , to be prepared if or when the political echelon decides to carry out that strike against Tehran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . During a speech at the Institute for National Security Studies conference in Tel Aviv last year , Kohavi said he had ordered the military to begin preparing renewed plan for a strike on Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program . & ldquo ; Iran can decide that it want to advance to a bomb , either covertly or in a provocative way , & rdquo ; Kohavi said . & ldquo ; In light of this basic analysis , I have ordered the IDF to prepare a number of operational plan in addition to the existing one . We are studying these plan , and we will develop them over the next year . The government , of course , will be the one to decide if they should be used . But these plan must be on the table , in existence and trained for . & rdquo ; With tension increasing over Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program and regional hostility , both Israel and Iran have been threatening each other . Senior officer have said the military is capable of carrying out a strike . On Friday , at the end of five day of military drill , Iran fired 16 ballistic missile toward a target simulating Israel & rsquo ; s nuclear facility in Dimona . The IDF know that should a strike be ordered , the response would be a multifront war with Hamas , Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy , firing thousand of rocket , including precision missile , toward Israel and it strategic asset . To prepare for such a scenario , the IDF ha increased it intelligence-gathering capability for future operation , procuring additional weaponry , updating operational plan for all front , increased training exercise over the past year , and updated it target bank . Although the amount of precision weapon it ha is 10 time the number it had on the eve of the Second Lebanon War , the IDF is continuing to procure a large amount of precision and special munition . The NIS 58 billion defense budget set for the IDF in the coming year is expected to allow the military to focus on the threat posed by Iran across the region , with NIS 3.5b . designated for this . Intelligence and operational cooperation , along with joint exercise with foreign and regional country , are also helping Israel & rsquo ; s security and are of great significance , the military belief . A year after the signing of the Abraham Accords , which led to the normalization of relation with several Arab country , the potential for cooperation and the building of significant military manpower is already evident . The main threat to the country remain the rocket arsenal of Hamas and Hezbollah , Iran & rsquo ; s nuclear program , and potential nuclear weapon and infiltration force such a Hezbollah & rsquo ; s Radwan Unit . As tension with Lebanon and Syria remained high , 31 rocket were fired from Lebanon and another two long-range rocket were fired from Syria . In response to the rocket fired from Lebanon ( by Palestinians and Hezbollah ) , the IDF fired munition from fighter plane and some 200 artillery shell . The military also thwarted nine attempt to infiltrate from Lebanon and another two from Syria . It also confiscated 120 kilogram of drug and 75 weapon over the past year . Despite the ongoing tension , the IDF view the overall strategic-security situation a having improved compared with previous year .",kohavi : increase in syria ops ha led to decrease in iran weapon smuggling

It seems the man ha been very successful in his business career and ha adopted a liberal approach on economic issue . We are ready to work with any Israeli leader who will help u strengthen our economy . But Bennett and other Israelis need to understand that the Palestinian issue is not just about the economy or improving the living condition of people . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; A Palestinian businessman from Ramallah said that the Palestinians would & ldquo ; welcome & rdquo ; any plan for boosting the Palestinian economy , & ldquo ; even if they come from someone like Bennett , who is an extremist when it come to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .

2023-02-03 12:25:15.547,jpost,"Since the signing of the Oslo Accords , the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan , and the Wye River Agreement in the 1990s , effort by politician and diplomat to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have stalled . In the 21st century , according to Rabbi Ron Kronish , religious extremism , ultranationalist fanaticism , and intransigent leadership on both side , fueled by competing narrative about the past and the present , meant & ldquo ; a war process replaced the peace process . & rdquo ; According to Kronish , after then-opposition leader and Maj . - Gen . ( re . ) Ariel Sharon made a provocative visit to the Temple Mount , Palestinians launched a Second Intifada ; the Israeli government constructed what it called a & ldquo ; security fence , & rdquo ; which Palestinians blasted a an & ldquo ; apartheid wall & rdquo ; ; and , in 2005 prime minister Sharon ordered what turned out to be a disastrous withdrawal of Jewish settler and the IDF from the Gaza Strip.These development , Kronish state in his book Profiles in Peace , have made peacebuilders & ldquo ; the only game in town . & rdquo ; The initiative of the non-governmental organization they established , he belief , provide the last best hope to influence decision-makers to reverse course and make compromise to ensure a just and lasting resolution to what is now regarded a an intractable conflict.Can NGOs help decision-makers make peace ? Born in the US and educated at Brandeis University and Harvard & rsquo ; s Graduate School of Education , Kronish immigrated to Israel in 1979 , four month after Israel and Egypt signed a peace agreement . In 1982 , Kronish took to the street , joining protest declaring the Israeli army complicit in the massacre of Palestinians in the refugee camp of Sabra and Shatilla in Beirut . & nbsp ; From 1991-2014 , he served a the founder and director of the Interreligious Coordinating Council in Israel ( ICCI ) . A harsh critic of what he call the & ldquo ; militaristic , anti-Palestinian , pro-occupation & rdquo ; Likud Party , a well a PLO and Hamas terrorist , Kronish is the author of The Other Peace Process ( 2017 ) . In Profiles in Peace , Kronish review effort by politician to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since the 1967 Six Day War and provides biographical sketch of six peacebuilders & ndash ; three Israelis and three Palestinian Arabs & ndash ; and four member of a younger generation of activist . & nbsp ; Despite & ldquo ; overwhelming obstacle and complex challenge , & rdquo ; Kronish claim , these men and woman have demonstrated that & ldquo ; enriching and energizing & rdquo ; relationship with perceived enemy can be forged , laying the foundation for a common future for Jews , Christians and Arabs.Peacebuilders operate on the assumption that dialogue on subject of mutual interest , undertaken in supportive setting , enhanced by precept of trauma healing and conflict resolution , can empower individual to bridge religious and ethnic difference . Hands of Peace , for example , brings Israeli and Palestinian teenager to the US for four successive summer . In 2018 , the Alliance for Middle East Peace created a Storyteller & rsquo ; s Project to enlist peacebuilding alumnus , including Israeli and Palestinian soldier , to share their experiences.Again and again ( Profiles in Peace , ala , is often repetitious ) , Kronish single out initiative to & ldquo ; get to know & lsquo ; the other & rsquo ; deeply , & rdquo ; and take seriously his or her religious and historical narrative , a central to peace work.Who are the activist ? KRONISH & rsquo ; S ACTIVISTS & ndash ; Huda Abuarquob , Mohammed Dajani Daoudi , Munib Younan , Michael Melchior , Galia Golan , and Hadassah Froman & ndash ; have certainly exhibited an abundance of courage , conviction , commitment , perseverance and resilience.It & rsquo ; s less clear , however , how effective their effort have been . Kronish doe not address study revealing that contact doe not increase religious or ethnic toleration in & ldquo ; weak relationship . & rdquo ; And that self-selection is a significant ( and therefore limiting ) factor in forging enduring relationship with perceived enemies.As Kronish and his peacebuilders acknowledge , moreover , the political context between Israel and the Palestinians ha made free and unfettered interreligious and intercultural dialogue difficult to arrange . When Dajani , a professor of American study and librarian at Al-Quds University , proposed taking 30 Palestinian student to Auschwitz and 30 student to a refugee camp in Bethlehem , a violent response to the trip led to his resignation and the cancellation of the project . & nbsp ; And neither Israeli nor Palestinian authority accepted the recommendation of Bishop Younan & rsquo ; s Council of Religious Institutions of the Holy Land to revise textbook in the schools.Most important , during the last two decade , peacebuilders & rsquo ; initiative have not had a significant impact on Israeli or Palestinian politician , or for that matter , on public opinion.And so , it should not be surprising that , along with frequent expression of hope , Kronish & rsquo ; s peacebuilders sometimes give voice to pessimism about the future . Given & ldquo ; the many force of violence and opposition to what we are doing , & rdquo ; Froman declares her intention , somehow , to & ldquo ; create a small oasis of peaceful coexistence & rdquo ; in her area of the West Bank . & nbsp ; Convinced that & ldquo ; civil strife may one day lead to the end of Israel , regardless of the occupation , & rdquo ; Golan find it & ldquo ; very difficult to be optimistic these day . & rdquo ; Although dialogue ha broadened his horizon , Tareq Saman , one of Kronish & rsquo ; s younger peacebuilders , ha concluded that & ldquo ; there is no solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict & hellip ; It look like one party will win and the other will lose . & rdquo ; Responding in his prison notebook to the rise of fascism in the 1930s , Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci indicated he wa & ldquo ; far from feeling beaten . It seems to me that & hellip ; a man out to be deeply convinced that the source of his own moral force is himself & hellip ; never fall into those vulgar , banal mood , pessimism and optimism . My own state of mind synthesizes these two feeling and transcends them ; my mind is pessimistic , but my will is optimistic & hellip ; I imagine the worst that could happen in order to summon up my reason and willpower to overcome every obstacle . & rdquo ; In all likelihood , Kronish doe not endorse Gramsci & rsquo ; s pessimism of the intellect & ndash ; even if the considerable obstacle in Israel , the West Bank and Gaza make it seem reasonable to do so .  The writer is the Thomas and Dorothy Litwin Professor of American Studies at Cornell University.PROFILES IN PEACEBy Ron KronishL.E.A.R.H.N .

2024-03-06 20:43:45.870,jpost,"The Likud & rsquo ; s response to the Meron report is indicative of the party & rsquo ; s tactic and strategy surrounding the question of responsibility , accountability , and blame for the October 7 Hamas massacre : Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not to blame , and anyone who claim so ha partisan political motives.The response came from the party , not from the prime minister himself . Netanyahu & rsquo ; s medium team know how to put him in the limelight when they want to : they use video statement , picture , written statement , and often a mix of all of the above . In this case , a written statement from the Likud party , not the prime minister himself , show that the prime minister intends to keep himself a far away a possible from the report & rsquo ; s conclusions.The content of the response follows this theme . It begin , & ldquo ; The Meron disaster wa tragic , our heart are with the family of the victim . In practice , the government ha already implemented the required conclusion , and the last event at Meron wa held with a large crowd and without fault . The government will examine the need to implement additional operational lesson to prevent a repetition of a disaster such a this . & rdquo ; The statement then move on to accusation : & ldquo ; However , it is unfortunate that for the first time in history , the government led by Bennett and Lapid formed a committee of investigation against it predecessor in the political Right , and in which a central member wa a confidante of Lapid , Shlomo Yanai , who received an offer for a spot in the Yesh Atid Knesset list . This is a completely distinct political provocation . Lapid & rsquo ; s cynical and intentional attempt to turn the Meron disaster into a political tool will not succeed . & rdquo ; This response wa criticized by member of nearly all of the political party , including the Likud itself , a well a by a forum that represents the family of the victim , who called it & ldquo ; disgraceful . & rdquo ; It is worth noting that member of the National Commission of Inquiry were chosen by then-chief justice Esther Hayut , not by the Lapid-Bennett government . The Netanyahu government at the time of the disaster dragged it foot in forming the committee , and at first attempted to form a governmental or parliamentary committee , which would give it some power over the identity of the committee member , a well a reduce the impact of it conclusions.Furthermore , the Likud & rsquo ; s response did not mention that Yanai is a retired IDF Major General , a recipient of the IDF & rsquo ; s Medal of Distinguished Service , a former CEO of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries , and , according to Haaretz reporter Yossi Melman , wa Netanyahu & rsquo ; s choice to head the Mossad in 2010 ( which Yanai turned down ) . Nor did the response mention the other distinguished member of the commission & ndash ; former Supreme Court President Miriam Naor , who wa replaced by Tel Aviv District Court president Devorah Berliner , and Rabbi Mordechai Karelitz , former mayor of Bnei Brak.Instead of at least acknowledging the fact that Netanyahu wa found to bear personal responsibility for the disaster , the response attempt to discredit the member of the committee . Other than saying that the government will examine whether there are any more lesson to implement , the response doe not address any of the sweeping systemic failure that the committee found led to the disaster & ndash ; nor the fact that these failure were exacerbated during the decade before the disaster , during which Netanyahu wa prime minister.Likud responds similarly to October 7The response is indicative of how the Likud ha responded to the October 7 massacre . At least on two occasion , the Likud put out immediate response to reported intelligence failure leading up to the massacre , in which it said that Netanyahu wa not aware of the intelligence and that he wa not forewarned by IDF officials.The prime minister ha promised that there will be a committee of investigation , but it is not clear when such a committee will be formed . In addition , since the October 7 massacre , he mentioned the word & ldquo ; responsibility & rdquo ; in just one press conference & ndash ; and said that he wa & ldquo ; responsible for the future of the State of Israel , & rdquo ; which implied that he wa not responsible for event in the past.The government wa slammed with responsibility for the failure of October 7 , and at first , the word & ldquo ; responsibility & rdquo ; wa uttered by no one ; slowly , that changed . IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi said it first , followed by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich . Netanyahu still ha not.A direct line link the Likud & rsquo ; s response to the Meron report and it statement since the October 7 massacre : Netanyahu is not responsible , and whoever claim so ha political motif . This is likely to continue , and it is thus not clear how and when those who bear responsibility for the event of October 7 will be held accountable . & nbsp ;",likud 's response to the meron report is indicative of what 's to come - analysis

Deaths from the Israel-Hezbollah conflict are continuing to rise , and over 100,000 Israelis are still evacuated from their home in northern Israel , leading some to question the efficacy of the UN peacekeeper force meant to maintain security in southern Lebanon.After the Israeli army finished a military operation against the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) in Lebanon in 1978 , the UN established a temporary peacekeeping force known a the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) . The body wa meant to restore international peace and security and to assist Lebanon & rsquo ; s government and army in restoring control of the border with Israel.Israel & rsquo ; s 1978 invasion pushed the PLO north of the Litani River , about 18 mile from the border , in order to limit attack against Israel . Despite the establishment of UNIFIL a a peacekeeper force , Israel returned to Lebanon in 1982 . In 2006 , another conflict broke out between Israel and Hezbollah , a Lebanese Shiite group with tie to Iran.After 34 day of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006 , the UN brokered a cease-fire . Under the agreement , UN Security Council Resolution 1701 , Israel and Hezbollah agreed to cease hostility , and UNIFIL wa tasked with ensuring that no armed group other than itself and the Lebanese army operated south of the Litani River.Today , UNIFIL comprises more than 10,000 soldier from 49 nation . In addition to monitoring the border , the organization also provides humanitarian assistance to civilian affected by the exchange of fire in southern Lebanon.UNIFIL 's role pre-October 7 & ldquo ; Before Oct . 7 , we were able to guarantee the overall stability of the southern border for year , and this wa clearly a success , & rdquo ; Andrea Tenenti , spokesperson for the UNIFIL mission , told The Media Line . & ldquo ; We played an active role . In fact , we have helped the Lebanese army , starting from 2008 , to regain control of the southern part of the country . & rdquo ; Despite UNIFIL & rsquo ; s success , Hezbollah ha grown stronger in southern Lebanon since 2006 , especially in the town and village along the 75-mile-long demarcation line , leading some to criticize UNIFIL a ineffective . Since Oct . 7 , a constant clash between Hezbollah and Israel have plagued southern Lebanon and northern Israel , those criticism have grown louder . & ldquo ; The UNIFIL mission started with very weak point and ended up being more a cease-fire resolution than a peacekeeping one , & rdquo ; Hanin Ghaddar , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute , told The Media Line . She noted that the force mostly report violation . & ldquo ; They do not possess the tool and permission from the UN to confiscate weapon or even arrest those affiliated with & rdquo ; Hezbollah , she said.Tenenti characterized UNIFIL a & ldquo ; the only one who can mediate properly & rdquo ; amid the rising tension , noting that the group had arranged meeting between the Israeli and Lebanese armies.UNIFIL doe not only monitor the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel & mdash ; at time , it find itself caught up in that contact . & nbsp ; Among other incident , a car bomb killed six UNIFIL personnel in 2007 , and in October , two mortar shell of undetermined origin hit a UNIFIL base , injuring one peacekeeper . & ldquo ; Hezbollah target UNIFIL because they do not want another actor in the south , & rdquo ; Ghaddar explained . & ldquo ; It is never an accident when UNIFIL personnel is targeted because the militant group aim to send a message both to the country that serve in these force and to the UN : do not interfere with our activity in the southern part of the country . & rdquo ; Avraham Levine , a speaker at the northern Israel-based Alma Research and Education Center , told The Media Line that Hezbollah ha more control over UNIFIL than UNIFIL doe over Hezbollah . & ldquo ; There are area where UNIFIL personnel can not go to , and if they end up by mistake in Hezbollah & rsquo ; s territory , they are attacked on the spot , their vehicle are burnt , and sometimes they are even shot down , & rdquo ; he said.Levine also said that Hezbollah us UNIFIL base for it military purpose . & ldquo ; Both in 2006 and in further operation that Israel carried against Hezbollah , the militant used UNIFIL compound a shield for their operation in order to stop Israel & rsquo ; s counterattack against a UN base , & rdquo ; he said.One of the rocket launched at Israel by Hezbollah in December originated just 20 yard from a UNIFIL compound.Levine said that the Lebanese army & rsquo ; s lack of action to rein in Hezbollah relates to the Shia sympathy of many of the soldier a well a the interest in avoiding another Lebanese civil war.Describing both UNIFIL and the Lebanese army a ineffective deterrent to Hezbollah , he said that Israel may have to invade Lebanon once again . & ldquo ; We can not risk another Oct . 7 in the northern part of Israel since [ Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan ] Nasrallah publicly claimed his goal to invade the Galilee . Even if this scenario is not pleasant for both side , we may need to stop Hezbollah by entering Lebanon a we did in the past , & rdquo ; he said.In the event that a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah doe break out , UNIFIL may be a target , Levine said . & ldquo ; Maybe this may push to reconsider it mission in the first place , & rdquo ; he speculated .",international peacekeeper day : unifil 's role questioned amid israel-hezbollah conflict

Moshe Elad told 104.5FM on Tuesday . `` Now , they are looking up to the sky and searching [ for IDF aircraft ] because they have been complacent due to the assumption that Israel is supposedly holding it fire , `` Elad told Gadi Ness in reply to whether Israeli force will find themselves in another direct confrontation with the Palestinian terror group in control of the Strip.Hamas ' carefully considering ' response to Israeli strike '' The question is `` whether the Palestinian Resistance Factions , which includes Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) , will issue an order to attack Israel , Elad continued . `` That is a very interesting question and , in my opinion , an attack by Hamas is under careful consideration because they have more to lose . There are close to 20,000 Palestinian worker who leave the Gaza Strip for work every day , [ Hamas ] understands this will no longer be the case if it open fire . `` Elad also speculated on the possibility that Hamas unit stationed across southern Lebanon will open fire at Israel 's North . `` They established a sub-Hezbollah , all under the Lebanese terror organization 's watchful eye . The question is whether it allows the Hamas faction in Lebanon to launch rocket or will they have to wait for confirmation from Iran . `` This scenario is plausible , `` Elad told 104.5FM . `` Including an order from the Iranians to start firing at Israel from all theater , including Iran itself . This would be an all-out war , `` he said.Military expert : An all-out war between Iran and Israel is possibleElad further warned the IDF that it might have to operate in three-to-four theatre simultaneously . `` Yes , we will be prepared .

2021-01-06 22:15:45.593,jpost,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ha promised to allocate an additional NIS 14 million to advance work on a project & ndash ; dubbed & ldquo ; sovereignty & rdquo ; or & ldquo ; apartheid & rdquo ; road & ndash ; that would link the E1 section of the Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim settlement with Jerusalem . & ldquo ; This is a significant breakthrough in advancing the issue , & rdquo ; Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim Mayor Benny Kashriel said in a statement on the matter posted on the city & rsquo ; s website . The project , also called the & ldquo ; Fabric of Life & rdquo ; road , is considered essential for the development of E1 , where Israel is slated to build 3,412 home in a move that would vastly expand Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim , which is the third-largest settler city in the West Bank , after Modi & rsquo ; in Illit and Betar Illit . The E1 project ha been largely frozen for close to three decade because Palestinians and the international community consider it harmful to the feasibility of a contiguous future Palestinian state . The US , excluding the Trump administration , had also historically objected to the project . Israel ha argued that the issue of contiguity is best addressed by an efficient but separate road system , including this one , that would allow direct Palestinian traffic between Ramallah and Bethlehem that skirt the E1 bloc , while Israeli travel between Jerusalem and Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim would also be made easier . Critics of the project have accused Israel of & ldquo ; apartheid & rdquo ; for it promotion of a road that separate Israeli and Palestinian traffic . The municipal notice about the project stated that there would be & ldquo ; a separate road for Palestinians in the E1 area , & rdquo ; which would distinguish between Israeli and Palestinian traffic so that & ldquo ; Palestinian vehicle could pas without traveling through the Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim bloc , near the Jewish settlement . & rdquo ; It noted that & ldquo ; at the political level , the road would connect Jerusalem and Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim and allow Jewish settlement construction in the E1 area . & rdquo ; The municipality added that it would ease traffic congestion and eliminate the need for checkpoint . The road would then exit from Eizariya-Abu Dis to the tunnel under the a-Zaim checkpoint , and vehicle would travel on a separate road toward Hizma-Ramallah , the municipality said . Yamina party head Naftali Bennett had initially promoted the project in March when he served a the defense minister . Kashriel said he had campaigned and pushed Netanyahu to allocate more funding , a move that bore fruit only this week , with a conversation between Kashriel , Netanyahu , Transportation Minister Miri Regev and Finance Minister Israel Katz , both of the Likud Party . Prior to the meeting Kashriel sent Netanyahu a letter in which he accused him of dragging his foot on the issue , noting that he had promised to pave the road three year ago at a Likud faction meeting in the Knesset . Then it wa determined that the road would be paved in 2020 . Again in August , a pledge wa once more given with respect to the road , and yet , Kashriel noted in his letter , he wa still seeking fund for the project . After receiving another pledge from Netanyahu for fund this week , Kashriel thanked the prime minister , along with Regev and Katz , for the help . The left-wing group Peace Now charged on Wednesday that the project wa part of Netanyahu & rsquo ; s reelection campaign . & ldquo ; Netanyahu & rsquo ; s election campaign is costing Israel a very heavy price . Once again , he is using the election period to try to impress key Likud supporter by promoting a plan that could eliminate the possibility of a two-state solution . The planned road will allow Israel to cut the West Bank in two , build E1 and the separation barrier , and close the door on the possibility of developing a sustainable Palestinian state . & rdquo ; In the last year , Netanyahu allowed for plan for 3,412 settler home in E1 to be deposited .

2024-06-03 08:46:01.000,jpost,"That old joke wa wrong . The book of Jewish sporting achievement is in fact quite thick . . . and fascinating . & ldquo ; In many way , the development of Jewish sport reflects the reality of Jewish life over the past 120 year , & rdquo ; say Osnat Zur , director of the Iris Smith World Jewish Sports Museum in Ramat Gan & rsquo ; s Kfar Hamaccabiah campus.The innovative 21st-century museum , inaugurated during the 22nd Maccabiah in 2022 , depicts an under-recounted aspect of the development of Jewish identity and Zionism . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The museum in essence tell not only the story of Jewish sport but of the Jews in general in the 20th century , & rdquo ; say Zur . & ldquo ; We embark on a journey through time , see how the nationalist movement arose around the world , how the first Maccabiah offered a vision , through the disaster of the Holocaust & ndash ; from which it took decade for Jewish sport to recover & ndash ; the Munich massacre , and on to October 7 . & rdquo ; A visit to the interactive display , suitable for child and adult alike , put Jewish sporting achievement in perspective . The 1,500 square-meter museum , designed by Israeli company Breeze Creative , present the history and heritage of Jewish sport through more than 1,000 rare item , video , and exhibit . & nbsp ; The museum & rsquo ; s timeline begin in 1890 with the establishment of the first Jewish sport club in Constantinople , Turkey , built around a fencing team . Then Max Nordau & rsquo ; s famous & ldquo ; muscular Jew & rdquo ; speech at the second Zionist Conference in Basel , Switzerland , in 1898 sparked the birth of dozen of Jewish sport club throughout Europe , and Jewish sport flourished in the early part of the 20th century . & nbsp ; In term of achievement , the best wa Hakoah Vienna , champion of the Austrian national soccer league in 1924-25 and runner-up in 1921-22 . The soccer club & rsquo ; s parent association wa the largest sporting organization in the world in it time , numbering more than 5,000 member and offering a wide variety of sporting activity . & nbsp ; Jewish sport & ndash ; notably fencing and boxing & ndash ; prospered in Europe until Nazism reared it evil head . The museum & rsquo ; s display chart the rise in antisemitism in Europe , with Jewish athlete and team gradually banned from competing . The chronological section devoted to 1933-39 is titled & ldquo ; From Champions to Victims . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Hitler viewed the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games a a propaganda tool & ndash ; and the world agreed to his term , a one of the video display explains ( in your chosen language ) . Signs at entrance to the Olympic stadium pronounced & ldquo ; No entry for dog and Jews . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Then-world champion swimmer Judith Deutch refused to represent Austria , made aliyah instead , and passed away in 2004 after a meaningful life in Israel . It should be noted , however , that other Jews competed in the Olympic Games , and were forced to salute Hitler . & nbsp ; Hakoah Vienna could not survive the Anschluss of March 11-13 , 1938 , when Nazi Germany annexed neighboring Austria , and the club disbanded in 1941 , only to reestablish itself after World War II on a modest scale.Meanwhile , a more Jewish immigrant poured into pre-state Israel , the local sporting union Maccabi , Hapoel , and Beitar burgeoned , each with it own political affiliation and patron . & nbsp ; The Maccabiah is really one man & rsquo ; s idea . Yosef Yekutieli & ndash ; who later went on to establish the Israel Football Association and Israel Olympic Committee & ndash ; had the then-maverick vision of holding a & ldquo ; Jewish Olympics & rdquo ; in 1932 , and advertised the event by riding his motorcycle throughout Europe . Some 470 competitor turned up for the inaugural Games in Tel Aviv that year . For the second Maccabiah in 1935 , some 1,200 athlete competed in a specially erected stadium and swimming pool . Then came the war.The third Maccabiah in 1952 wa a small , sad event that became known a the & ldquo ; revival Maccabiah & rdquo ; & ndash ; an axiom to be repeated in the 2025 event . Since then , the quadrennial Games have increasingly attracted Jewish ( and some non-Jewish ) athlete by the thousand , earning the moniker & ldquo ; the second-largest sporting event in the world & rdquo ; ( in term of number of athlete competing ) after the Olympics . The Maccabiah is an event with a meaning beyond sport . Among the dignitary attending the last opening ceremony wa US President Joe Biden.Documenting the pastThe need for a museum documenting the rise , fall , and rise again of Jewish sport ha become more evident a more Jewish athlete have made their mark on the world stage . & nbsp ; Admittedly , Jews may not have left their mark the way they have , say , on the Nobel Prize , but the list of Jewish sport legend & ndash ; from the 18th-century father of scientific boxing Daniel Mendoza , through baseball legend Sandy Koufax to multiple gold medalist swimmer Mark Spitz & ndash ; is richer than generally perceived . & ldquo ; There had been more talk about establishing the museum over the past decade , & rdquo ; say Zur . & ldquo ; Then came a generous donation from Iris Smith that allowed the project to go ahead . & rdquo ; Orit Engelberg-Baram wa chosen a content curator , a committee of leading sportspeople and sport historian assembled . . . then the pandemic broke out , and everything stopped . & ldquo ; Ultimately , this actually worked for our good , & rdquo ; say Zur . & ldquo ; Maccabi & rsquo ; s outside activity came to a halt , suddenly freeing up time and resource for this project in a new building under construction on the site of the old museum . & rdquo ; ( The site at Kfar Maccabiah wa previously home to a charming , if somewhat aging , corner called The Pierre Gildesgame Maccabi Sports Museum , established in 1982 , with an archive and exhibit concerning Judaism , Zionism , and Sports . ) & nbsp ; The museum employ English - , Spanish - , and Hebrew-speaking guide . Over 40,000 visitor have passed through so far , mainly Israeli school and pensioner group and Jewish group such a Taglit-Birthright and Masa , but also & ndash ; somewhat surprisingly & ndash ; many individual non-Jewish tourist . & ldquo ; They want to understand the essence of this country , and sport is part of that , & rdquo ; explains Zur , a former Young Maccabi emissary in the US who is now director of the Maccabiah 's Education Department & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s not easy to be a Jewish sportsperson nowadays , & rdquo ; she note . & ldquo ; Jewish athlete worldwide are increasingly afraid to identify with Israel . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Even more so their non-Jewish colleague , at a time when being pro-Palestinian is considered cool . & nbsp ; Within day of October 7 , the Maccabi World Union launched it Sportspeakup project , recruiting over 150 leading athlete from around the world & ndash ; including 15 non-Jewish former NBA basketball player & ndash ; who recorded social medium message calling for the release of Israeli hostage . & nbsp ; But it wasn & rsquo ; t easy . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Even though it & rsquo ; s a humanitarian issue not a political one , many of the sportspeople we approached said they were scared to participate . They didn & rsquo ; t want to deal with antisemitic cry from supporter at their game , & rdquo ; explains Zur . & nbsp ; Victory of sport over evilAs Israeli society slowly recovers from the trauma , the museum & rsquo ; s first planned temporary exhibition in July will concentrate on October 7 and sport . & ldquo ; Many sportspeople died that day , & rdquo ; Zur sigh . & ldquo ; There were some heart-wrenching story , a mixed reaction from the sport world to the event , and more antisemitism in sport . & rdquo ; The exhibition will recount the story of Israeli sport through the mirror of October 7 , focusing on the sporting victory in this most difficult year in the country & rsquo ; s history .

Brody put this down to a cultural shift . & ldquo ; There & rsquo ; s far more physical activity here than in the past .

Our athlete have to go out to the world where people don & rsquo ; t understand the situation , where they hear false narrative and there & rsquo ; s an antisemitic atmosphere . But the people of Israel believe in the country , and our sportsman also feel this . Even a the war rage , our athlete are taking top place in competition in place like Qatar and Tashkent , proudly competing with the Star of David on their uniform . & rdquo ; & nbsp ;","sporting jew : the rise , fall , and rise of the ' muscular jew '"

2024-06-19 04:21:31.920,jpost,"Recently , there ha been a flood of request for monetary help on serious health issue ; widowed mother of large family left destitute ; a haredi man who naively agreed to put an extra parcel in his luggage , not knowing that it contained cocaine , is languishing in prison , with his wife claiming that he is dying there ; and a whole bunch of other request for aid.Most are truly heartbreaking , but they raise certain doubt . In nearly all case , they appear to be from member of haredi community . They are written in perfect English , even though they come from people who supposedly learned minimal English at school . The personal address of the sender is omitted , so there & rsquo ; s no way to check the authenticity of the story , which make receiver of such message & ndash ; some of which come at the rate of three or four a day & ndash ; feel guilty when the request is to save the life of a baby with a brain tumor or a severe heart problem.But the one that really arouse suspicion are post from bride who , on the day before the wedding , still don & rsquo ; t have the money to purchase a wedding dress , let alone refreshment for the guests.First of all , in haredi and also non-haredi circle , there & rsquo ; s a traditional charitable outlet called a gemah ( an abbreviation of gemilut hassadim , meaning giving charity , doing good deed ) which provides wedding dress and formal wear free of charge , or at a symbolic rental cost to all and sundry . In the case of an orphan bride or one who come from a needy family , in the haredi community neighbor band together to provide a modest repast to celebrate the occasion . So there is no need for alleged bride to ask for help in purchasing a wedding gown , when they can get one gratis.But there are genuine case , which should have where to turn , in addition to any help they may receive from local and government welfare services.An example is a same-sex couple , Michal and Rotem and their four-year-old daughter , Omer , who were rescued from the atrocity surrounding their home on Kibbutz Be & rsquo ; eri . One of the woman wa six month pregnant and subsequently gave birth to twin . The baby brought much light and joy into the life of their parent , but unfortunately , one of them , Shahar , wa born with a severe heart defect that urgently requires surgery.The surgery he need is not available in Israel and can be performed only in Boston . The cost is prohibitive , and there is nothing that either of the mother owns that can be sold to pay for the expense involved . While the Boston Jewish community might be of some assistance , it is unlikely that it could cover all the cost . Anyone who want to help , may do so via http : / / yanshufim.giveback.co.il/Our_Heart_HeLooking into newly-elected Mexican president 's Jewish pastMOST PEOPLE who are second - or third-generation Holocaust survivor make a point of telling the story of parent or grandparent who were actual survivor . Apparently , this doe not apply to Mexico & rsquo ; s recently elected president , Claudia Sheinbaum , who is her country & rsquo ; s first female and first Jewish president-elect.Writing in The Forward , Andrew Silverstein noted that Sheinbaum ha stated that her mother wa born in Mexico , whereas record suggest she wa born in Bulgaria and survived the Holocaust . One wonder why Sheinbaum would want to hide such a fact.ALTHOUGH HE spent a large part of his life away from his native Jerusalem , novelist and playwright A.B . Yehoshua , a graduate of Gymnasia Rehavia and the Hebrew University , will be commemorated in the city of his birth on the second anniversary of his death.The title of a tribute evening at Mishkenot Sha & rsquo ; ananim , & ldquo ; We had a Lover , & rdquo ; is based on line from his 1977 novel , The Lover : & ldquo ; We lost a lover in the last war . We had a lover , but since that war , we haven & rsquo ; t had one . He simply disappeared . & rdquo ; The evening , moderated by Avi Gil , will be completely dedicated to the admiration and yearning for Yehoshua and will feature the launch of Gil & rsquo ; s biography , The Mission of A.B . Yehoshua , which cover the different stage in the life of the man considered to be the backbone of contemporary Hebrew literature.Among other participant will be actress Michal Bat-Adam , who directed and starred in the film The Lover ; Yair Kedar , who directed the film The Last Chapter of A.B . Yehoshua , part of which will be screened during the evening ; book reviewer Dan Meron , who wa also a close friend of Yehoshua ; and Prof . Eilat Shamir , who wa a student and friend of the author & rsquo ; s son Gidi Yehoshua.WITH REGARD to film , Roni Mahadav-Levin , the CEO of the Jerusalem Cinematheque , is giving film buff ample notice to save the date for the 41st annual Jerusalem Film Festival , which traditionally take place in the summer , while the annual Jewish film festival take place in the winter.The Jerusalem Film Festival will be held July 18-27 , 2024 , in an effort to restore what used to be perceived a normal life.The festival is being held with the support of the Culture Ministry , the Van Leer Foundation , and the Jerusalem Foundation . & ldquo ; Sadly , this is not the first time that the festival is being held in the shadow of war , & rdquo ; said Mahadav-Levin . & ldquo ; But both in good time and difficult time , we believe in the need to create and screen good film , in the belief in the power of the art of film in strengthening , healing , and giving hope that a different reality is possible . & ldquo ; This can be seen through the myriad of film that will be shown during the festival . & rdquo ; VP Harris view Oct . 7 documentary & nbsp ; FOLLOWING SCREENINGS in Israel of Screams Before Silence , the moving documentary in which philanthropist and former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg meet Supernova music festival survivor and returned hostage , the film wa shown in part at the White House this week , where it wa viewed by Vice President Kamila Harris , who wa joined by Sandberg and returned hostage Amit Soussana.Soussana said that , while in captivity , she had no control over her mind , body , or soul . Although it wa difficult for her to tell her story of sexual abuse and violence by Hamas , she said , it wa more difficult to remain silent . & ldquo ; We can not look away , & rdquo ; said Harris . & ldquo ; We must not be silent . & rdquo ; A PHOTO exhibition designed to draw attention to the hostage still waiting to return from Gaza can be seen at Tel Aviv & rsquo ; s Charles Bronfman Auditorium , and will remain on view till June 29.Hundreds of amateur and professional photographer from across the country submitted photo , and paring down the choice wa extremely difficult.Perhaps photo not chosen can be sent to other city , so that , in the final analysis , most will be seen by a wider public.Among people attending the opening were representative of the hostage family , executive member of Bank Hapoalim and Yoman Masa ( Travelog ) , which sponsored the exhibition , and survivor of the October 7 Hamas assault , including Sharon Sharabi , whose brother Yossi and Eli , were kidnapped from Kibbutz Be & rsquo ; eri . Yossi wa subsequently murdered . Eli & rsquo ; s fate is unknown . His wife and two daughter were murdered.Merav Berger , the mother of Agam Berger , one of the IDF lookout team of observer who wa abducted from Kibbutz Nahal Oz , came with other member of the Berger family . A photo by Dana Draznin under the title Homage to Agam feature Agam & rsquo ; s parent , Shlomo and Merav , holding the violin that Agam loved to play.The exhibition wa the brainchild of Igal Bareket , Hapoalim & rsquo ; s chief marketing officer , who happens to be an avid amateur photographer . Bareket wa on hand with Hapoalim CEO Dov Kotler and Yoman Masa owner Itamar Peleg.AS ONE of his final ceremonial deed in office , Australian Governor-General David Hurley , a the representative in Australia of King Charles , conferred King Charles Birthday honor on more than 700 people , among them South African-born Prof .

She ha been a member of the Australian Faculty of The Prince of Wales & rsquo ; s Business & amp ; Sustainability Program for 12 year , and a senior associate in the international program.The daughter of an army officer , Mostyn is a lawyer by training , who launched her career a an associate in the Court of Appeal of the New South Wales Supreme Court , and ha worked at law firm Freehills and Gilbert and Tobin . She ha more recently been awarded an honorary doctorate of law from the Australian National University.Mostyn ha also had an extensive career in the Australian business community , including working at senior level in telecommunication and insurance company in Australia and globally . She ha also held senior nonexecutive role on board , including Transurban and Virgin Australia , and ha been chairwoman of Citibank Australia . She currently chair AWARE Super and Alberts Music Group and is on the board of Mirvac.In addition , she ha been a commissioner with the Australian Football League and a driving force behind the AFL Women & rsquo ; s football.As if all that is not enough , Mostyn ha chaired multiple not-for-profit board , including Beyond Blue , the Foundation of Young Australians , Australians Investing in Women , Ausfilm , the Australian National Research Organization for Women & rsquo ; s Safety , and Australian Volunteers International . She ha been president of the Australian Council for International Development and president of Chief Executive Women , a well a a National Mental Health Commission commissioner.The governor-general hold office at the pleasure of the king . However , the term is usually understood to be five year . It will be interesting to see what Mostyn will accomplish during that period.IT & rsquo ; S DIFFICULT to measure patriotism or even to define it . People of totally opposing view may regard themselves a patriot and the others a traitor . In Israel , the latter connotation usually go hand in hand with being called a leftist , whereas , when the boot is on the other foot , one of the unsavory epithet is & ldquo ; fascist . & rdquo ; A battle over patriotism is brewing between two social medium combatant , Yair Netanyahu , the elder son of the prime minister , and Ran Rahav , one of Israel & rsquo ; s leading public relation executives.In recent day , Yair Netanyahu released a video in which he denigrates IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi , Israel Security Agency head Ronen Bar , and former head of Military Intelligence Maj . - Gen . Aharon Haliva , who resigned after acknowledging the intelligence failure that led to the October 7 massacre.Accompanying a montage of the trio is a caption : & ldquo ; Who appointed you ? & rdquo ; Further along is an attack on Benny Gantz , who ha previously been targeted by Netanyahu Jr.Did his father not tell him that thing like that are not done in a time of war ? Many influential political , diplomatic , and military expert have attributed the Hamas assault on Israel to the perception that a divided society is weak and vulnerable . What wa Netanyahu Jr . thinking in driving the wedge further than it is already ? Rahav , who never hesitates to speak his mind over what he considers to be injustice , wa fast in using his X account and his own brand of scorn . He suggested that Netanyahu Jr . desist from opening his mouth against the defense establishment during the war for a long a the State of Israel pay for him to have a bodyguard . & ldquo ; It cost million , & rdquo ; wrote Rahav . & ldquo ; The least you can do is respect the Israeli taxpayer . After the war , there will be a State Commission of inquiry , headed by an emeritus president of the Supreme Court , and you can testify before it . But until then , someone protected by his state can not open his mouth in a time of war . & rdquo ; A THREE-DAY day festival of tour and literary activity for the junior generation will be held at the National Library of Israel in celebration of Hebrew Book Week.Events will be held Monday through Wednesday , June 24-26 , 4 p.m . - 11 p.m . , and will include musical performance , meeting , tour , and various activity for child & ndash ; all dedicated to Hebrew literature and creativity.Among the event will be a musical performance on Monday , hosted by Lior Ashkenazi , to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Israel & rsquo ; s poet laureate Yehuda Amichai .

Wassem Mahmoud , who wa due to be released from the Army on April 1 , but insisted on going back into Gaza to fight with his comrades.It is part of the Druze tradition to be absolutely loyal to the host country of which they are citizen , but the Israel government doe not respect this , and in the opinion of member of the Druze community , they are treated a second-class citizens.Halabi said that head of Druze local council had met with Netanyahu last week to express their concern about receiving inadequate budget from the state , and to continue their protest against the Nation-State Law.Halabi and Dabbour also made the point that on a percentage basis , Beit Jann ha the highest army casualty rate in the country.They could not understand why a community that ha given so much receives so little in return . Dabbour also noted that soldier who fall behind in paying their mortgage , or who have built home without the proper legal permission , go to fight in Gaza , and return to find their home destroyed on order by the Israeli authorities.Bedouin tracker , who are among the best in the country and are also serving in the IDF , if they live in illegal village may not find their home when they return from the army . Their home may have been bulldozed.How doe Israel expect to maintain the loyalty of it minority community , if it treat them in such an insensitive and disrespectful manner ? THE BIG question on the mind of many Israelis is will Israel recover fully from October 7 ? To anyone who experienced the Yom Kippur War , the answer is yes . The misery and uncertainty that now encompass the country were in a sense even more horrific then than now , because there were no mobile phone , no fax , and not every home possessed a ground line telephone . The IDF death toll wa 2,691 during a war that lasted for less than a month . As painful a the current IDF casualty rate is , there are far fewer fallen soldier over a much longer period , though there have been a larger number of civilian casualty , particularly on October 7 itself.In the early day after the Hamas massacre , Shani Louk , a pretty 22-year-old dual national who carried German a well a Israeli citizenship , became the global symbol of Hamas tyranny and inhumanity.Kidnapped at the Supernova music festival by Hamas terrorist wearing body cam , a video of her unconscious body on the back of a truck wa circulated around the globe.Her family clung to the hope that she wa still alive , especially after information filtered through that she wa being treated in a Gaza hospital.German Ambassador to Israel Steffen Seibert maintained close contact with the Louk family and helped to publicize it ordeal and Germany & rsquo ; s concern.On October 30 , Shani Louk & rsquo ; s death wa confirmed.On Wednesday , June 19 , at 7 p.m . , her parent , Ricarda and Nissim Louk , will talk about the beloved , happy-go-lucky , music-loving daughter they remember at a special evening honoring Shani & rsquo ; s memory . Sharing in that conversation , organized by Tribe Israel , will be Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.The venue is Capella , Hagag Tower , 28 Ha & rsquo ; arba Street , Tel Aviv . Admission is free of charge . The event is reserved for people in Shani Louk & rsquo ; s age-group.WITH THE ongoing transformation of the State of Israel that inter alia includes change in the law , politics , the skyline , and the value we once held dear , the question arises a to whether future change will include the establishment of a casino.The late casino mogul Sheldon Adelson wanted to establish a casino in Eilat so that the southern resort city would truly become the Las Vegas of the Middle East . But he wa strongly opposed by a cabinet minister , the late Yosef Burg , who wa afraid that a casino would become a den of vice , peddling drug and promoting prostitution . Adelson & rsquo ; s vision on that score wa never realized.In an interview with the writer of this column , during the period in which he wa still trying to convince the Israeli authority , Adelson said that he had never seen anyone have sex on a gambling table.Since then , he married an Israeli and built casino empire in Singapore and Macao.Israelis like to gamble , and when the Hilton Taba casino opened in 1994 , only 200 meter from the Israeli border , gambler crossed nightly from Eilat to Taba to place their bet . A lot of money that could have stayed in Israel ended up in Egypt.But before then and even afterward , several illegal and well-patronized casino opened across Israel , but were short-lived due to police raids.The only legalized gambling in Israel is the Mifal Hapayis national lottery , which ha increased the variety of game and prize available to the public , and Toto sport gambling.Sheldon Adelson , who died three-and-a-half year ago , wa a keen supporter of the Republican Party and one of it most generous bankrollers . Following his death , his wife Dr . Miriam Adelson wa a little more reserved in her donation to the party but , according to medium report , is now throwing her financial weight behind Donald Trump , who during his presidency honored her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Recently , Miriam Adelson and her son-in-law Patrick Dumont acquired the majority share in the Dallas Mavericks in order to give the Las Vegas Sands Corporation a foothold in the Lone Star State , where they hope to introduce casino . Texas is very conservative about casino gambling , so Adelson and Dumont will have a hard row to hoe.She also poured a lot of money into the election campaign of Dade Phelan , which helped him to be reelected a speaker of the Texas House of Representatives.If she succeeds in opening a casino in Texas , Adelson may turn her attention to Israel , where she is the publisher of the free , informative tabloid Israel Hayom.She is also a generous benefactor to various Israeli cause . She and her husband gave Yad Vashem it largest-ever donation , and they did not skimp on other cause they supported.At a time when Israel is experiencing an economic disaster , Adelson & rsquo ; s fiscal assistance to the nation may help to swing legislation in favor of casinos.greerfc @ gmail.com","grapevine june 19 , 2024 : scam v authenticity"

2024-04-21 03:57:45.440,jpost,"When Israel needed water in the desert , we created pioneering irrigation technology . When faced with non-conventional threat , we became a cyber empire . In the wake of the October 7 tragedy , Israel is still facing a whole new host of problem . These challenge , though new to Israelis , are too familiar to many country that experience natural and man-made disaster . Sadly , these disaster are growing in frequency and severity.The awful experience that October 7 forced upon u can break u or lead to the development of the most powerful impact-tech ecosystem the world ha ever seen , changing the trajectory of this space forever . This will not be an easy opportunity to seize , but we believe that we must go all in & ndash ; it will serve our recovery process , it & rsquo ; s an opportunity to play a role in addressing global challenge , and it offer an incredible economic engine if we do it right . Disasters are not going away , but our innovative response can turn adversity into opportunity.Much ha been written about Israel a the Start-up Nation , the blossoming , Middle Eastern tech miracle where there are more start-ups per caput than anywhere else on the planet.Israel & rsquo ; s tech ecosystem unsurprisingly focus on sector such a cyber , fintech , and enterprise solution ; and with good reason . The ecosystem grew under the influence of foreign tech leader and venture capitalist with background in corporates , the military , and finance , and wa fueled by innovation from the IDF . This influence ha paved the way for Israeli founder to focus on problem affecting company and institution in the US and Western society & ndash ; a sensible approach given the financial opportunity in these area and the first-hand experience of the ecosystem veteran who were able to mentor , fund , and support entrepreneur working on problem they knew.OCTOBER 7 and subsequent event have thrust all Israelis into uncharted territory . Despite struggling with disbelief and contending with a government that is untrusted and not functioning ideally , Israelis and their ally around the world have responded with what we believe will be remembered in history a one of the best community response to a disaster . CEOs became philanthropist , conference space became donation center , volunteer were organized to replace worker drafted into reserve service , and a jaw-dropping amount of donation wa collected.Unsurprisingly & ndash ; we also witnessed an extraordinary surge in ad hoc & lsquo ; emergency & rsquo ; hack . New tech solution were developed to identify and track people in distress , provide rapid response documentation solution in field condition , leverage CRMs for data management of displaced individual , utilize AI to identify missing and kidnapped people , and more.As Israel transition from emergency response to recovery , we are starting to see a similar innovative spirit in addressing long-term recovery issues.Innovating recoveryOne example is Citizen AI & ndash ; a fintech start-up that leverage it financial education platform to help individual and organization understand their right and navigate the complex benefit system . Utilization of right and financial health is not a new problem in Israel ( nor around the world ) , but now , the flood of people in need and the new program are driving focus and clarity to what is required.In the agriculture sector , program such a ReGrow Israel are not only focused on building what wa destroyed , but are also seizing the opportunity to build a more advanced , tech-enabled , and resilient agricultural ecosystem . These program have the potential to not only strengthen the food system that sustains the country and support the livelihood of family of farmer and other business on the value chain & ndash ; but also to provide critical insight and learning to fuel AgTech companies.We are seeing a surge in innovation in the physical and mental health space . With so many individual working to recover and integrate back into society and the dozen of people surrounding them , in a place like Israel , this can only mean one thing : more ground-breaking idea and solutions.One example is the Lev Hasharon Mental Health Center where cutting-edge technology such a VR are integrated into the care plan of mental health patient , in department such a hospitalization , daycare , and specialized clinic for sexual trauma and child-and-youth mental support .

2023-01-29 19:37:42.637,jpost,"In February 2005 , during the government of then-prime minister Ariel Sharon , then-defense minister Shaul Mofaz and IDF chief Moshe Ya & rsquo ; alon ordered a moratorium of punitive house demolition against the family of Palestinian terrorists.A commission of top defense expert led by Maj . - Gen . ( re . ) Udi Shani had empirically studied whether house demolition over the last few year of the Second Intifada had increased deterrence against terrorist , concluding that the opposite wa true.Yet in 2023 , it seems that nearly the entire defense establishment is convinced that house demolition do deter future potential terror attacks.They are so sure that they even want to seal off the house of the family of the 13-year-old Palestinian who shot but did not kill , two Israeli victim & ndash ; which would be the first time that such a measure would be taken against an attempted murderer versus an actual murderer.What , if anything , changed between 2005 and 2023 about Israel , the Palestinians , house demolition and deterrence ? The 2005 committee found that house demolition , rather than deterring future terrorism , generally inflamed hatred and increased motivation for future attack by Palestinians against Israel.According to the defense commission , there had only been 20 case in which the threat of demolition deterred potential attacker or pushed their family to turn them in & ndash ; out of hundred of demolition since 2001.Fundamentally , the commission report simply pointed out that after hundred of demolition , the Second Intifada had not been put down.Furthermore , the report said that in many case house demolition hit family which , other than the one terrorist attacker , were not part of a greater terror group and were viewed by the greater Palestinian public a illegitimate collective punishment.This meant that sometimes new terrorist were even being created from family or neighbor of these family who might not have become a problem.Another part of the problem , the committee said , wa that different Palestinian group , whether the Palestinian Authority , Hamas or otherwise , frequently compensated family of terrorist and helped them rebuild new home , weakening possible deterrence.In addition , if there had been some short period earlier in the Second Intifada when a small number of demolition might have had a deterrent effect , a the policy went on longer , the deterrent effect wa lost.With some very limited exception , Israel stopped demolishing Palestinian house for punitive deterrent purpose from 2005-2014 & ndash ; almost a decade.It wa after Palestinian terrorist murdered three Jewish teenager that the then-government of Benjamin Netanyahu ( who went almost five year without demolition ) reinstated the demolition policy.The issue wa probed again by the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) during the 2015-2016 Knife Intifada , but this time the overwhelming majority of official found that the demolition were having a deterrent effect.Significant number of Palestinians who started toward an attack , but relented , or parent who turned in their kid before they could commit an attack in process , said that saving the family house had impacted them greatly.Some official did a victory lap on the issue in 2016 a one of the reason & ndash ; along with new technology and analysis of social medium & ndash ; that the Knife Intifada wa put down before it blew up into a & ldquo ; full Intifada . & rdquo ; The Jerusalem Post recently received additional confirmation from defense official dealing with some of the greatest Palestinian violence in the northern West Bank which concluded that demolition are still providing deterrence.They repeated the same updated 2022 testimony of Palestinians ( not just relying on the 2015-2016 data ) who pulled back from terror at the last minute or turned in their kid to stop them from terror.One fascinating point wa that some of these official did not even know that Israel & rsquo ; s moratorium on house demolition had gone on for so long , nearly a decade . In fact , they were quite shocked by the notion.Part of what is interesting about that is that the year 2005-2014 & ndash ; without house demolition & ndash ; were a much less violent time period than 2015-2023 ha been with house demolitions.Of course , one counterresponse to this argument is that this wa because the IDF hit Palestinian terror much harder and deeper during the Second Intifada , and it wa this that provided quiet.Some also say that if the IDF did house demolition faster , not with week or month of delay , then there would be greater deterrence . Maybe , but there is no guarantee there either , and there have been case where a terrorist & rsquo ; s family had nothing to do with their activity and rushing forward without figuring that out would have broken even Israeli law a it currently exists ( keeping in mind that though international law ha a place for house demolition , Israel is an outlier among democracy in actually performing them ) . Some other question worth askingBut it is worth asking ; when Israeli defense official in 2023 say they are sure that demolition provide deterrence , are they fully and seriously considering the opposing view ? If some of them do not even recall a world without house demolition , can they be said to fully consider that view ? And if Israel ha been doing them more aggressively than ever since March 2022 without ending the current wave of violence , what doe that say ? There are no easy answer to these question . But they are question that could be crucial to ask by security professional who seriously consider both side and who ignore partisan noise for and against the demolition on either political side of the spectrum .","demolishing house did n't stop terror in 2005 , why doe it work in 2023 ? - analysis"

It & rsquo ; s way harder to make decision , and most mayor want to stay mayor because they enjoyed [ the ] independence & hellip ; On the other hand , when we a mayor look about and we see how the central government is run , we have a lot of criticism , and we say that with our experience we can go and create a change there . & rdquo ; Revivi claim entering national politics `` not attractive '' Revivi , 55 , ha served a mayor of Efrat since 2008 but lost in the recent election to Dudi Sheffler . During 2016-2020 , he wa also the international liaison of the Council of Jewish Communities in Judea , Samaria , and the Gaza Strip , and he is an IDF lieutenant-colonel in the reserves.During his childhood , Revivi spent time in the US and UK . His wife immigrated to Israel from the UK , and his English is perfect , a rare commodity among Israeli politician , in general , and religious one , in particular.Not only doe he speak English , but Revivi said he also know how to & ldquo ; understand English , & rdquo ; a skill that is lacking in the national arena.For example , Revivi , who attended former US president Donald Trump & rsquo ; s inauguration ceremony by invitation , said while his colleague gushed with excitement over Trump & rsquo ; s support for Israel , he wa more wary of the & ldquo ; America first & rdquo ; foreign policy . The significance of this concept wa lost on non-English-speaking politician , he said.Fiery statement by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir against US President Joe Biden & rsquo ; s policy indicate a lack of understanding of the importance of the US-Israel relationship , Revivi said.Biden is & ldquo ; proving to be maybe the most friendly president to the State of Israel that Israel ever had , & rdquo ; he said . But Biden is a Democrat in an election year , and some of his policy , such a recent sanction on several settler , should be viewed in that light and not necessarily a an act against Israel , he added.Some minister are acting & ldquo ; a if they are equivalent to the president of the United States , & rdquo ; Revivi said . & ldquo ; We & rsquo ; re not talking about it between equal , & rdquo ; he added.The sanction imposed by Biden were a mistake , Revivi said , adding that he would think about them differently . & ldquo ; When a president of the United States say to the State of Israel , & lsquo ; I don & rsquo ; t rely on your judicial system ; I don & rsquo ; t rely on you enforcing the law , & rsquo ; that is a problematic statement , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; We shouldn & rsquo ; t have gone into that situation . & rdquo ; Israel depends on the US for munition , including Iron Dome missile , and alienating the US could lead to rocket flying uninterrupted from Gaza to Tel Aviv , Revivi said.Cabinet minister in current and past government have also acted insensitivity toward US Jewry , he said . When minister spoke out against the Kotel compromise to enable egalitarian prayer at an isolated segment of the Western Wall or against recognizing non-Orthodox conversion , they were not aware of the implication for US Jewry , he added . Similarly , when Israeli minister call incessantly on Diaspora Jews to make aliyah , they are not always aware of the price these Jews pay to do so , which often include a downgrade in living standard or salaries.At the beginning of the war against Hamas , & ldquo ; A lot of donation came from the United States , a very hard-warming hug from the Jews in the Diaspora , & rdquo ; Revivi said . But they did not feel like Israelis had expressed their appreciation , and some felt that & ldquo ; nobody wa listening to them once the money came , & rdquo ; he said.Revivi said one of his accomplishment a mayor wa that Efrat grew by 60 % during his tenure , including the eight year of the Obama administration , which viewed settlement expansion unfavorably . This required an understanding of the dynamic of Israeli-US relation and wa another example of the value of leader who have this understanding , he said.Revivi said he intends to use his ability to serve a a bridge between the US and Israel in his next endeavor , adding that he doe not know whether this will be in the political arena , the Jewish relation arena , or elsewhere . & nbsp ;",‘ major pressure ’ on outgoing efrat mayor oded revivi to join national politics

Meanwhile , Irena frantically search for her daughter on the eve of the Passover holiday.She created these character and told their story through a complex writing process that took her several year .

Lapid quoted the line : & ldquo ; Don & rsquo ; t tell me , oy , but he & rsquo ; s been gone a long time/Tell me , he just went out and he & rsquo ; ll be back soon . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; For her , this wa the & ldquo ; most heartbreaking poem I & rsquo ; ve ever heard . . . .

She spoke with a woman who worked a a counselor at a center run by Elem , for at-risk youth , about how girl like Nina are preyed on by men like Johnny . & ldquo ; And she told me , & lsquo ; It doesn & rsquo ; t happen all at once . & rsquo ; . . . .

Lapid & rsquo ; s brother passed away from cancer after the book wa finished and the book is dedicated to him . & ldquo ; We were very close . . . . He knew me better than I know myself . He knew I would become a writer before I knew . & rdquo ; Lapid may seem to be the ultimate Tel Aviv insider , and at first , it is surprising that she wrote about character who live on the margin of society , but a you speak to her more , you begin to understand that she can identify with these character because she also grew up feeling like an outsider.Born in Arad , a town where & ldquo ; you visit for a minute to get a cup of coffee and to go to the bathroom when the bus stop on the way to Masada , & rdquo ; she moved with her parent , who ran a Judaica store , to the Tel Aviv area when she wa in her teen and struggled to fit in . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The distance between a place like Sderot or Arad and Tel Aviv can be even longer than the distance between Tel Aviv and New York , & rdquo ; she noted . & nbsp ; Working a a photojournalist in Tel Aviv after the army , when she first met and then married Yair , she initially felt intimidated by his distinguished family . Yair Lapid wa an actor and author at that time , and his father , Tommy Lapid , wa a politician and a journalist , while his mother , Shulamit Lapid , is an acclaimed novelist . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I took literature course at the university to keep up with them , so I wouldn & rsquo ; t seem like an idiot at their family dinner , where they spoke about literature and art all the time . & rdquo ; She turned to writing after she suffered two miscarriage and wa put on bedrest when she wa pregnant with her son , Lior , and needed a way to express herself that didn & rsquo ; t involve running around Tel Aviv on a motorcycle with a camera . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; When Lior wa born , I understood that no newspaper is looking for a photographer who ha to nurse every four hour . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Another way in which Lapid look at the world differently from how you might expect is that her daughter , Yael , is on the autism spectrum . I have known Lapid slightly for many year because I also have a son on the spectrum the same age a her daughter , and she is the president of SHEKEL , an organization for people with special need in Israel . & nbsp ; Both of the Lapids have been upfront about their struggle raising their daughter . At first , after Yael & rsquo ; s diagnosis , Lapid wa consumed by trying to help her , to the exclusion of everything else . & ldquo ; I wa a wreck , I didn & rsquo ; t want to see anyone , I didn & rsquo ; t want to work , I just wanted to save her , I tried to do everything for her . . . . There wa a very dramatic moment , where Yair said to me , & lsquo ; You have other child who need you . & nbsp ; And you have me , and I need you . Yaeli will be who she is for life , she & rsquo ; s not a project for a couple of year , it & rsquo ; s not like she & rsquo ; ll go swimming with dolphin and then everything will be fine . . . . This ha to go back to being a happy home . & rsquo ; & rdquo ; Now , having a special-needs daughter is an important part of who she is , but not her full identity . & ldquo ; I am connected to Yael , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; I will always need to be there for her . But I & rsquo ; m also a writer , I & rsquo ; m also Lior & rsquo ; s mother and Yair & rsquo ; s wife . I & rsquo ; m also a friend . & rdquo ; It wa interesting for her to write the section about Nina and Irena & rsquo ; s relationship , because her relationship with her daughter is very different . & ldquo ; I have a daughter I can & rsquo ; t fight with the way Irena and Nina fight in the book . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; One aspect of the response to her book in Israel that ha pleased her is that , & ldquo ; People have said , it & rsquo ; s so Israeli . & rdquo ; Now that it ha been published in English , she isn & rsquo ; t afraid that reader in other country will find it too Israeli and won & rsquo ; t be able to relate to it . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s like reading a book from abroad , a book like The Kite Runner , and it & rsquo ; s wonderful that it give you an authentic glimpse into another world , a window into the life of someone completely different . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Just before heading off to the rally , she said that since October 7 , she felt that the story of the bereaved mother in the novel wa even more relevant . & ldquo ; Every time I see a picture of a soldier who ha been killed , I think , there & rsquo ; s another mother like Carmela now , who will miss him for 30 or 40 year , who won & rsquo ; t be able to feel happy for 30 or 40 year . & nbsp ; They are soldier , but they are also our child . . . . Now that the book is being published in English , I think people who read it outside of Israel will have a greater understanding of what it mean to be Israeli , of the price we pay for our life here , that & rsquo ; s very meaningful to me . & rdquo ;",lihi lapid 's novel ‘ on her own ’

2024-03-20 02:37:21.257,jpost,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden spoke on the phone Monday for the first time in over a month a tension between the two leader continue to increase.The conversation focused on Israel & rsquo ; s war against Hamas . The campaign , which is now in it sixth month , ha driven a wedge between the longtime ally that some are calling unprecedented . While the relationship between the US and Israel ha been dotted with disagreement and crisis , the alliance ha largely been considered steadfast and unwavering.Tensions between President Biden and Netanyahu were evident even before the war , a the Israeli government sought to promote a widespread reform of the country & rsquo ; s judicial system . While Netanyahu insisted that the reform would make Israel even more democratic , the US voiced it concern that the overhaul would concentrate power in Israel & rsquo ; s executive branch . The White House also criticized the inclusion of several far-right ultranationalist cabinet minister in the Netanyahu government.Immediate support after Oct . 7 , but is now it dwindling ? Following Hamas & rsquo ; surprise offensive against Israel , during which approximately 1,200 people were killed , President Biden set aside his difference with Netanyahu and moved to show immediate support for the Jewish state . In a visit to Tel Aviv just day after the attack , the American leader expressed solidarity with the Israeli people and vowed to continue the steady supply of arm to Israel . The US also mobilized aircraft carrier to the region to deter Israel & rsquo ; s other foe , mainly Iran , from joining the war.As the war continued , the US raised more question about Israel & rsquo ; s tactic and end-game strategy . Israel & rsquo ; s offensive in Gaza ha led to high casualty , with Gaza & rsquo ; s Hamas-run Health Ministry reporting over 31,000 Palestinians killed and 73,000 injured . The offensive ha led to widespread destruction in the territory that will cost billion of dollar to repair . Various international organization have also warned of famine in Gaza , upping the pressure on Israel to halt it offensive.In the past week , the tone adopted by senior American official toward Israel & rsquo ; s leader ha escalated . Earlier this year , the American president wa reported to have called Netanyahu a & ldquo ; bad f * * * ing guy , & rdquo ; which he denied having said . But last week , he went on the record saying the Israeli leader wa causing more harm than good to his country . & ldquo ; This is a unique crisis , both because it is in the midst of a war and because of what appears to be it very personal nature , & rdquo ; Dr . Shay Har-Zvi , head of the International and Middle Eastern Arenas at Reichman University & rsquo ; s Institute for Policy and Strategy , told The Media Line . & ldquo ; The personal criticism , rather than criticism of policy , make this crisis exceptional and perhaps one of the most acute . & rdquo ; The main point of contention is a pending Israeli military operation in Rafah , a city in the southern Gaza Strip . According to the United Nations , a majority of the approximately 1.7 million Palestinians displaced by the war are taking shelter in Rafah . Rafah is the only city in Gaza that ha not yet seen an operation of Israeli ground troops.As Israel delay it operation in Rafah , international pressure against operating in the city ha grown . Many country are warning of an exacerbated humanitarian crisis in Rafah , prompting Israel to consider how best to handle the city & rsquo ; s civilian population.Netanyahu ha vowed to operate in Rafah , saying that Hamas & rsquo ; senior leadership is hiding there . The city is also home to an extensive underground tunnel network that is believed to cross into neighboring Egypt . The tunnel are Hamas & rsquo ; main lifeline and source of weapon , making the target a critical one in Israel & rsquo ; s mission to dismantle the terrorist organization & rsquo ; s military capability . & ldquo ; The US feel Israel is not doing enough to meet the humanitarian need in Gaza and they want answer about how Israel intends to deal with the civilian presence in Rafah , & rdquo ; Har-Zvi said . & ldquo ; The humanitarian issue is at the core of the disagreement . & rdquo ; According to a White House readout of the call between the two leader , Netanyahu agreed to send a delegation to the US to & ldquo ; exchange view and discus alternative approach that would target key element of Hamas and secure the Egypt-Gaza border without a major ground operation in Rafah . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; The American perception is that because of Netanyahu & rsquo ; s political consideration , he is rejecting any possible solution , & rdquo ; Har-Zvi added . & ldquo ; He is not only missing what could be a historic opportunity , but also strategically entangling Israel by increasing the risk of a wider conflict and this will directly hurt American strategic interest . & rdquo ; Tensions on Israel & rsquo ; s northern border have also escalated , threatening to widen the scope of the conflict . These development have the White House increasingly on edge.Negotiations for a truce and a deal that would see the Israeli hostage being held by Hamas released could have a calming effect on the region . Those talk are currently underway in Qatar . & ldquo ; The US government is concerned that the failure of these talk will mean a regional escalation , & rdquo ; Har-Zvi said . & ldquo ; There is an understanding within the administration that the region is now at a critical crossroad . & rdquo ; During last month & rsquo ; s Democratic primary in Michigan , in which the incumbent president wa running uncontested , 13 % of voter voted & ldquo ; uncommitted & rdquo ; a part of a movement to protest his handling of the Israel-Gaza war . That result signaled to the White House that it Gaza policy wa putting the president at risk . & ldquo ; In the beginning of the war , Biden wa willing to pay the price for his support for Israel , but now the uncommitted vote appear to be gaining momentum and will likely influence Biden , & rdquo ; Har-Zvi explained.Over the weekend , Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer sharply criticized Netanyahu and called for early election in Israel . Schumer wa criticized both by Israelis and by US Republicans for interfering in internal Israeli affair . The president praised the majority leader & rsquo ; s speech , further upsetting Netanyahu.Although the current tension between Israel and the US have been called unprecedented , the two country have faced rocky period before . & ldquo ; There is a tendency to see crisis a & lsquo ; the worst & rsquo ; in the heat of the moment , & rdquo ; Zalman Shoval , a former Israeli ambassador to the US , told The Media Line.He said there have been & ldquo ; far worse & rdquo ; crisis than what Israel and the US are currently facing.In the aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur War , Israel and the US faced disagreement about how to prevent future conflict between Israel and Egypt . As a result of the disagreement , the US & ldquo ; reassessed & rdquo ; it relation with Israel and froze arm delivery to the country , leading to great tension between the ally . Israel later went on to sign a disengagement agreement with Egypt , likely due to American pressure.In the early 1990s , President George H.W . Bush announced that the US would withhold loan guarantee to Israel until it stopped building settlement in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.Both crisis appeared unprecedented and , to some , insurmountable.Israeli and American society have both changed significantly since the time of those crisis . The Israeli public ha increasingly shifted to the right , with consistently less support for a negotiated solution that would see the establishment of a Palestinian state . The Democratic Party ha also changed in recent year , with a growing progressive element that show more support for the Palestinians . & ldquo ; These change must not be underestimated , & rdquo ; Shoval said . & ldquo ; The political future of both country is unclear . & rdquo ; This future depends very much on the fate of the American and Israeli leader . President Biden is in the midst of an election campaign set to culminate in November 2024 . Netanyahu is lagging in the poll , and his increasingly unpopular government is not expected to last until the scheduled 2026 election . The outcome of election in both country will impact how the crisis play out . & ldquo ; The question is whether the US will continue to see itself a the leader of the Western world or if isolationist tendency will grow , & rdquo ; Shoval said.He added that personal chemistry between the two leader is not a significant a factor a many believe . Israel and the US still have mutual interest , and the country will eventually overcome the current crisis , Shoval said . & ldquo ; American defense support for Israel also stem from it own interest , including financial one , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; Unless there will be a fundamental shift in the US , this cooperation will continue . & rdquo ; Israel spends billion of dollar every year on American weapon system , military equipment , and services.The US appears eager to end the war , despite it stated support for Israel & rsquo ; s goal of dismantling Hamas . Public opinion in Israel , on the other hand , is very much in favor of continuing the war effort . This trend is evident in many poll and is independent of Netanyahu & rsquo ; s declining popularity . & ldquo ; When Americans come to express reservation about Netanyahu , they need to remember that there is overwhelming support in Israel for the war , & rdquo ; Shoval said . & ldquo ; I am not sure they understand the basic factor in the domestic politics here . & rdquo ;","us-israel relation tested a gap between president biden , netanyahu widens - analysis"

2021-06-22 19:55:32.610,jpost,"There are large gap in trust between Israelis , Palestinians and Arab-Israelis across Israel and the Palestinian territory , according to a recent survey by Tel Aviv University ( TAU ) . & quot ; Unsurprisingly , the Jewish public expressed very high level of distrust towards the Palestinians in Gaza ( 85 % ) and on the West Bank ( 84 % ) , & quot ; TAU said in it report . & quot ; But still , these are a bit lower than the level of total distrust of Hamas ( 97 % ) . Among respondent in the Jewish public , there is also distrust of Arabs who are citizen of Israel , except among left-winger , a three-quarters of them expressed trust in Arab citizen of Israel . & quot ; In comparison , mistrust of Palestinians and Arab-Israelis by the Jewish public is at & quot ; higher level & quot ; than that of the Arab public @ @ @ s perception of the Jewish public , which is reported to be at more & quot ; moderate & quot ; level . While the majority of respondent relayed their willingness to close said gap , by strengthening equality and cooperation between the side , Jewish respondent feel a need to strengthen & quot ; Jewish control & quot ; over the region following the most recent escalation and civil unrest that plagued the country in May & mdash ; Although that notion had low support from the left-wing Israeli supporter . Arab-Israeli respondent showed clear support ( 75 % ) for increasing equality among the Jewish and Arab group . & quot ; In contrast , the Arab public expressed more ambivalence regarding their level of trust for all three of the group mentioned , but among those who expressed opinion , a majority ( 61 % ) expressed distrust of Jewish citizen of Israel , & quot ; TAU explained . Zoning in on relation between the two opposing group , a larger majority of the Jewish public are for further coordination with Arab-Israeli citizen and Palestinians alike & mdash ; except those who stand in right-wing camp , who held split opinion on such a step . Arab-Israeli respondent additionally expressed their support ( 71 % ) for further cooperation between the group and an opposition to separating the group , although stood divided on policy that would increase Israeli control across the region . & quot ; Most of the left and center ( 95 % and 83 % respectively ) support increased equality for the two group , while half of the moderate right-wing support such move , & quot ; TAU said . & quot ; Among the right-wing , only 28 % expressed support . & quot ; Similar data appear for the four ideological Jewish group , regarding the level of opposition to an increase in separation between Arabs and Jews ( 85 % , 65 % , 55 % , and 27 % respectively ) . & quot ; With regard to the widespread civil unrest that plagued the country during the most recent IDF operation in the Gaza Strip , half of the Israeli public wa under the belief that former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to deal with the violence properly , nor did they believe the violence wa justified but instead instigated by Palestinians and Arab-Israelis holding position of influence across the region , while the Arab public believed Netanyahu fueled the strife . Right-wing ( 81 % ) and moderate right-wing ( 74 % ) Israeli supporter both shared the belief that Netanyahu did not want to exacerbate the recent civil unrest that stormed through the mixed-cities across the country , while left-wing supporter ( 82 % ) and centrist ( 69 % ) thought the exact opposite & mdash ; displaying the mirror image of both camp with regard to the former prime minister . Similarly , although displaying further gap in opinion , right-wing camp believed Netanyahu did well to quell the violence while left-wing Israelis in greater majority believed that he aggravated the situation . The general Arab public tended to hold similar view with the left-wing camp across Israel , that instead of stamping out the violence , Netanyahu incited it to further the operation in Gaza . Both Arab and Jewish sector did , however , agree that the violence wa unjustified and only furthered the divide between the two side . When asked about the IDF @ @ @ s Operation Guardian of the Wall , around half of the Jewish public belief Israel & quot ; achieved more significant gain than Hamas in the recent fighting . & quot ; This is despite the feeling that the world perceives the operation a being of a & nbsp ; & quot ; disproportionate nature . & quot ; A larger majority support further military operation to bring the total collapse of Hamas in the Gaza Strip or long-term solution to the ongoing conflict . & quot ; Most of the Arab public support a long-term solution ( 57 % ) , but a third did not express their opinion , & quot ; TAU said . The most common answer given , however , across the Arab sector wa that they & quot ; did not know & quot ; who gained the upper hand in the fighting , and with regard to international opinion surrounding how the conflict played out , they are evenly divided on how the world view Israel in the aftermath of the violence believing that many country still support the Jewish State regardless .

Experts said they were evidence of the last Jewish revolt against Roman rule in Israel & ndash ; 1,650 year ago.The dramatic discovery is the first-ever evidence in Lod of the Gallus Revolt , the last Jewish resistance against Roman rule , between 351 and 354 CE.The excavation wa carried out on Nordau Street in the building from the late Roman-early Byzantine period that suffered violent destruction . Presumably , the coin , dating from 221 to 354 CE , were deliberately placed there in the hope that the owner would return to collect them when the situation calmed down.There is very little written evidence about the Gallus Revolt . However , text indicate that the force of Roman Caesar Flavius Constantinus Gallus destroyed major Jewish community such a Lod , Zipori , and Tiberias.Among the various find in the building were impressive stone and marble artifact , along with Greek , Hebrew , and Latin inscription , including one bearing the name of a Jewish man from a priestly family , which is still under examination.These inscription , coupled with the complete absence of pig bone from the bone assemblage uncovered on the site , attest to this building & rsquo ; s association with the Jewish community . ' An exciting , very emotionally moving find ' & nbsp ; According to IAA site excavator Shahar Krispin and Mor Viezel , & ldquo ; In all likelihood , this is a magnificent Jewish building that housed the city & rsquo ; s elder . From Talmudic writing , we know that Lod wa a most significant Jewish center in the aftermath of the Second Temple & rsquo ; s destruction in Jerusalem . Some of the renowned & lsquo ; Sages of Lod & rsquo ; are Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkanos , Rabbi Tarfon , Rabbi Akiva , Rabbi Yosi Ha & rsquo ; Galili , and many more . & ldquo ; The building , destroyed down to it very foundation , is a clear indication that the revolt wa forcefully put down with violence and cruelty and wa not simply a local uprising event , a some earlier study contended . This is the singular witness , thus far , to the extent and power of this revolt in Lod , which is located in the country & rsquo ; s center . & rdquo ; IAA council head Prof . Joshua Schwartz , who study Talmudic-period Lod , noted that & ldquo ; it & rsquo ; s hard to know if this magnificent building served a synagogue , study hall , meeting hall of the elder , or all three of these function a one.But what is clear is that the building & rsquo ; s size , the coin hoard , and the assemblage of archaeological find produced by the excavation fit well Lod/Diospolis & rsquo ; s description , in both Jewish and non-Jewish source , a a center of Torah-true Jewish life in the Mishna and Talmud period . Lod & rsquo ; s role a a leading community with elder continued from after the destruction through to this moment , when it wa cruelly cut down in the Gallus Revolt . & rdquo ; IAA director Eli Escuzido concluded that & ldquo ; the impressive find uncovered here reinforce our responsibility to investigate and to conserve Lod & rsquo ; s history and rich heritage . Along with the city & rsquo ; s new exhibition center of the beautiful Lod mosaic , we now bring this building to the awareness of the general public . & rdquo ; Lod Mayor Yair Revivo added that & ldquo ; this is an exciting and very emotionally moving find , another link in the chain of Lod & rsquo ; s Tannaitic period heritage a host to the author of the Mishna and Lod & rsquo ; s Jewish history .

2022-02-03 16:02:08.767,jpost,"Former US president Donald Trump already believed at the beginning of his administration that prime minister & nbsp ; Benjamin Netanyahu did not want peace with the Palestinians , former US ambassador to Israel David Friedman reveals in his soon-to-be-released book , Sledgehammer . Friedman describes in the book & ndash ; set to be released on February 9 & ndash ; how he and Trump & rsquo ; s Middle East envoy at the time , Jason Greenblatt , tipped off Netanyahu and worked together to disabuse Trump of that notion . The ambassador describes a & ldquo ; brilliant move & rdquo ; by the Palestinians ahead of Trump & rsquo ; s visit to the region in May 2017 , in which they had & ldquo ; a respected businessman , major philanthropist and active player in the region , & rdquo ; and a Trump supporter , speak to the president on the topic . That person is Ron Lauder , who once supported Netanyahu but had a falling out with him , though Friedman doe not name him in the book . Lauder told Trump that the Palestinians & ldquo ; were prepared to make peace with Israel on very favorable term , even to include conceding all of Jerusalem to Israeli sovereignty and giving up the return of refugee , but the problem wa that Bibi Netanyahu wa unwilling to negotiate peace . The surrogate informed the president that he needed to pressure Netanyahu and embrace Abbas in order to make a deal . Trump bought it . . . He wa going to put the screw to Netanyahu to force a deal . & rdquo ; Knowing that Abbas would never consider such a deal that Lauder claimed , Greenblatt called Friedman , and they agreed that Netanyahu should be warned that the Palestinians had manipulated Trump . Netanyahu wa & ldquo ; very agitated & rdquo ; by the call , and called Friedman for a meeting . The ambassador suggested that the Prime Minister & rsquo ; s Office prepare a video that would reveal Abbas & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; true color . & rdquo ; Contrary to what journalist Bob Woodward reported in his book Rage & ndash ; that Netanyahu showed Trump a doctored video & ndash ; Friedman writes : & ldquo ; I emphasized that this needed to be completely honest & ndash ; nothing out of context and nothing subject to multiple interpretation . & rdquo ; In Trump & rsquo ; s first meeting in Israel with then-president Reuven Rivlin , he said , & ldquo ; He understood that Abbas wa desperate to do a peace deal , the prime minister of Israel wa unwilling . & rdquo ; Friedman , Greenblatt and the others were worried that Trump & rsquo ; s remark would be leaked to the press & ndash ; perhaps in light of Rivlin & rsquo ; s contentious relationship with Netanyahu & ndash ; but they were not . Trump then met one-on-one with Netanyahu , and 45 minute later , aide entered the room . The leader discussed Israel & rsquo ; s security , and Friedman suggested that they watch the video of Abbas & rsquo ; s speech . & ldquo ; With that we watched two minute of Abbas honoring terrorist , extolling violence , and vowing to never accept anything less than Israel & rsquo ; s total defeat , & rdquo ; Friedman recounted . & ldquo ; Abbas ranted that the blood of every shaheed & ndash ; literally a martyr but also a terrorist & ndash ; wa holy and would be avenged . & rdquo ; Friedman did not say the video included what Woodward & rsquo ; s book said , that it & ldquo ; sounded like Abbas wa ordering the murder of child . & rdquo ; After watching the video , Trump said , & ldquo ; Wow , is that the same guy I met in Washington last month ? He seemed like such a sweet , peaceful guy . & rdquo ; LATER IN the trip , when Trump met with Abbas in Bethlehem , he & ldquo ; laced into Abbas over the tape , demanding to know who he really wa , a peacemaker a he claimed in Washington or a terrorist a he proclaimed on the tape . & rdquo ; Friedman also reported that Abbas complained about Israeli security in the West Bank . & ldquo ; Trump asked him how much Israel wa charging the PA for those security service , & rdquo ; the ambassador wrote . & ldquo ; Abbas looked stunned . He replied that Israel wa performing those service at no cost to the Palestinians . & rdquo ; The book continues : & ldquo ; The president jumped on this admission . He observed that the Palestinians live in a very dangerous part of the world and have virtually no ability to defend themselves . . . He wa incredulous that Abbas wa rejecting free Israeli security support when Israel wa the only player in the region that knew how to fight these implacable foe . & ldquo ; Abbas looked at Trump a if he had two head & ndash ; no one had ever spoken to him before with this brutal clarity , & rdquo ; Friedman recalled . One of the recurring motif of Sledgehammer , a memoir of Friedman & rsquo ; s time a ambassador and relationship with Trump , is the envoy butting head with the establishment . He repeatedly clashed with former secretary of state Rex Tillerson , one of which wa about the video Friedman suggested that Netanyahu show Trump . Tillerson and then-national security adviser H.R . McMaster were & ldquo ; livid & rdquo ; and thought it wa a & ldquo ; cheap propaganda trick . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; I work for the president , nobody else , & rdquo ; Friedman said he told the official . & ldquo ; He had been given bad information . Frankly , I & rsquo ; m surprised you didn & rsquo ; t know about it . I am going to make sure that he is well informed so that he get Israel policy right . And I will keep doing that a long a I have this job , and even after I don & rsquo ; t . & rdquo ; Trump did not seem to see a problem with Friedman & rsquo ; s approach . At the end of the president & rsquo ; s trip to Israel , he wrote Friedman a letter commending the & ldquo ; tremendous job & rdquo ; he did , and that he & ldquo ; will be able to help u negotiate the ultimate deal . & rdquo ; Trump reverted back to his pre-video-viewing opinion of Netanyahu in recent year . Friedman told this week & rsquo ; s Jerusalem Post & nbsp ; Podcast that Trump wa unhappy with Netanyahu & rsquo ; s speech at the White House in 2020 , when Trump presented his peace plan for the Israelis and Palestinians . Trump felt Netanyahu & rsquo ; s remark sounded too much like an election speech , and Netanyahu wa too hasty in pushing for sovereignty in Judea and Samaria , Friedman recounted . Speaking to Israeli journalist Barak Ravid in early 2021 , Trump said , & ldquo ; I thought the Palestinians were impossible , and the Israelis would do anything to make peace and a deal . I found that not to be true . & ldquo ; Bibi did not want to make a deal , & rdquo ; he stated . & ldquo ; I wish he would have said he didn & rsquo ; t want to make a deal . . . because a lot of people devoted a lot of work . But I don & rsquo ; t think Bibi would have ever made a deal . & rdquo ; Abbas , Trump posited , & ldquo ; wanted to make a deal more than Netanyahu . . .

As recounted in the Book of Joshua , after wandering in the wilderness for forty year , the Israelites , led by Joshua , stood on the eastern bank of the Jordan River , poised to enter the land of Canaan.Mirroring the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea led by Moses , Joshua ordered the priest carrying the Ark of the Covenant to step into the water of the Jordan . As they did , the river miraculously parted , allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground , just a the slave generation had done 40 year earlier . This event symbolized the fulfillment of God & rsquo ; s promise to deliver the land to the Israelites and marked the beginning of their conquest and settlement of Canaan.Historical research corroborates element of this biblical account , suggesting that the crossing of the Jordan River likely occurred at a shallow ford near the modern-day site of Kasser Al-Yahud . Archaeological evidence and geographical study support the plausibility of such an event , with scholar proposing that the timing of the crossing coincided with the spring thaw when the river & rsquo ; s water would have been at their lowest .","israeli commemorate bible 's jordan river crossing 3,300 year ago"

Hamas ha asserted that close to 16,000 Palestinians have been killed in war violence since hostility began on October 7 after the terror group infiltrated southern Israel killing over 1,200 people and seizing 240 hostages.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a & ldquo ; sustained humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza , the unconditional [ and ] immediate release of all hostage , and unimpeded [ and ] sustained humanitarian aid flow to meet the need of the people throughout the Gaza Strip . & rdquo ; Lynn Hastings , who is the humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territory , panned Israel & rsquo ; s safety zone in the south . & ldquo ; Israeli military operation have expanded into southern Gaza , forcing ten of thousand of others into increasingly compressed space , desperate to find food , water , shelter and safety , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo ; Nowhere is safe in Gaza and there is nowhere left to go , & rdquo ; she added . & ldquo ; The condition required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist . If possible , an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold , one in which humanitarian operation may not be able to respond . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; The quantity of relief supply and fuel allowed in are utterly insufficient . Despite the enormous effort of the Egyptian and Palestinian Red Crescent Societies , UN agency , and other partner , the use of only the Rafah crossing - meant for pedestrian - to bring in truck of good doe not work . & ldquo ; What we see today are shelter with no capacity , a health system on it knee , a lack of clean drinking water , no proper sanitation , and poor nutrition for people already mentally and physically exhausted : a textbook formula for epidemic and a public health disaster , & rdquo ; she said.The head of the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross , visited Gaza on Monday , issuing a statement in which she said the level of human suffering wa intolerable , called for the protection of civilian , respect for the law of war , and the release of hostage held by Hamas . `` We would welcome Hamas laying down it arm '' In Washington , State Department spokesman Matthew Miller defended the resumption of Israel & rsquo ; s military campaign to oust Hamas from Gaza that began after the October 7 attack . He blamed Hamas for the war and said that more people should call for the terror group to lay down it arm . & ldquo ; It is Hamas that is putting [ Palestinian ] civilian in harm 's way . I am surprised that I do not hear more people say why doesn & rsquo ; t Hamas move out of school ? why doesn & rsquo ; t Hamas take additional step to protect civilian ? Because we think they should a we think Israel should . & ldquo ; We would welcome Hamas laying down it arm at any point , & rdquo ; he added . & ldquo ; They could do it today if they cleared about Palestinian civilian life . & rdquo ; Miller also called on Israel to do more to protect civilian in Gaza , a Hamas asserted that close to 16,000 Palestinians have been killed in war-related violence.The United States is watching IDF action in Gaza & ldquo ; very closely , & rdquo ; Miller said a he explained that there were difference between Israel & rsquo ; s military campaign that resumed on December 1 and the one that ended on November 24 . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Too many Palestinians were killed in the opening week of the conflict , & ldquo ; Miller said . & ldquo ; We have seen a more targeted request for evacuation & rdquo ; by Israel so that the army is focused on clearing specific point rather than asking an entire city to evacuate , Miller said.Civilians have been asked to relocate to & ldquo ; de-confliction zone rather than being asked to flee , Miller said.During US Secretary of State Antony Blinken 's visit to Israel last week , he clarified to official & ldquo ; We do not want a military campaign in the south that look like it wa in the north . & rdquo ; Blinken wa briefed & ldquo ; on plan intended to avoid mass casualty . & rdquo ; It wa understood that there would be civilian casualty , & ldquo ; that is true in all war zone and is particularly true here & rdquo ; given that Hamas operates from within civilian area , Miller said.Both Miller and Sullivan addressed the collapse hostage deal by which 81 woman and child were freed , but there are still some 17 or 20 woman and child among the captives.Qatar and Egypt mediated the deal . Sullivan said that Israel and US official are still in conversation with those two country to seek a way to resume hostage releases.Miller said that the hostage deal partially fell apart last week because Hamas wanted to prevent the remaining Israeli woman it hold in Gaza from talking about their time in captivity . & ldquo ; It seems one of the reason they don & rsquo ; t want to turn woman over that they have been holding hostage and the reason this pause fell apart is that they do not want these woman to be able to talk about what happened to them during their time in captivity , & rdquo ; Miller alleged during an emotional moment in the press conference.Later in the briefing , Miller clarified that he doe not know this claim to be a definitive fact.Separately , in the briefing in Washington , Miller addressed the issue of settler violence saying that the US ha also spoken with Israel about doing more to crack down on attack against innocent Palestinians in the West Bank , Miller said . & ldquo ; We have seen them take some step to respond to violence . We do not think those step have been sufficient . They need to prosecute people who engage in violence against [ innocent ] Palestinians , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; We have made very clear to the Israeli government that we will be taking additional step to hold people accountable for violent extremism , & rdquo ; he said , explaining that this could include visa restrictions.Miller also addressed the issue of rising antisemitism , condemning it in the strongest term . & ldquo ; We oppose antisemitism wherever we see it , & rdquo ; Miller said . It & rsquo ; s tragic that after October 7 , & ldquo ; one of the response ha been an increase in antisemitism that is extremely tragic and it & rsquo ; s incumbent on everyone in position of authority to speak out . & rdquo ;",u : idf expected not to attack ‘ no-strike zone ’ in south gaza

2024-03-12 17:30:58.233,jpost,"Hezbollah is currently engaged in a war of attrition on the Israeli border , but it is not unlikely that they will receive order from Tehran to redirect force to another area they recently fought in & ndash ; northern Syria . In the past week , a wave of protest began in every district of the rebel-held Idlib province in northwestern Syria . This is the last stronghold of the Syrian opposition and the last remnant of the civil war in Syria from a decade ago , a war that ended in other area of the country in 2018.Syria 's Idlib district is not ready to surrenderAt the height of the civil war in Syria in 2015 , opposition force , led by Jabhat al-Nusra , a jihadist faction of al-Qaeda in Syria , united . The coalition of Islamist organization pushed the Syrian army out of the Idlib district and ha held most of it to this day . This is a district that the Syrian regime can not afford to ignore due to it strategic location . Idlib is very close to Latakia & ndash ; the stronghold of Syria 's ruling Alawite community , a well a to Russian military base in Syria & ndash ; the Russian-operated air force base in Hmeimim and the naval port in Tartus . Despite the relentless Syrian air force bombing on the Idlib district ( including even to the present day ) , the opposition maintains control of the area with impressive tenacity . It seems that in recent year , even Assad 's supporter have given up hope of seizing control of Idlib . Shi'ite militia have depleted their force in Syria , and most of Hezbollah 's men have returned to Lebanon . The Russians ' attention is elsewhere too , a they are deeply involved in the war in Ukraine.Bashar Assad 's army is not capable of effectively fighting , due to the significant wear and tear it ha endured . The economy of Syria is shattered , unemployment is rampant , and the currency continues to lose it value . There is no money to sustain the army or rebuild it significantly . However , this doe not stop Assad 's army from continuing to bomb the civilian of Idlib indiscriminately . The regime 's message is clear : life in the `` liberated `` territory will remain a hell until they return to Assad 's rule.The ruler of Idlib are trying to gain local legitimacy . They changed the name of their organization from Jabhat al-Nusra to `` Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham `` ( Organization for the Liberation of the Levant or HTS ) and seemingly distanced themselves from al-Qaeda , but they remain a jihadist fundamentalist group . The area under the organization 's control essentially are Islamic emirate with strict religious law . The region doe receive support from Turkey , mainly felt in civilian area , especially regarding food . However , Turkish aid is limited a Turkey itself is experiencing a complex economic crisis . Overall , the Idlib province suffers from severe poverty and unemployment.Israel is also involved without even knowing itBoth side , the Syrian regime and the opposition in Idlib , accuse each other of receiving Israeli support . The opposition constantly compare Assad 's bombing on school and hospital to the current situation in Gaza : to them , Assad and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are two similar enemy . The only place in Syria where demonstration in support of Gaza have taken place since October 7 wa in Idlib province . By contrast , the Syrian regime accuses the opposition of seeking help from Israel , a the Israeli Air Force often bomb Assad 's supporter in Syria & ndash ; mainly Shi'ite terrorist group such a Hezbollah . It seems that in the Middle East , the enemy of your enemy can still be your enemy.Opportunity for the Syrian regimeLast week , protest began in various area of Idlib province against the rule of HTS and specifically against the leader of the organization , Abu Mohammad al-Julani . Al Jazeera recently covered the development in the province with concern.According to Al Jazeera , which is known for it support of Islamic organization , the protest arose due to two issue : political and economic & ndash ; the authoritarian rule of the provincial leader , accusation of corruption , and the severe economic crisis . Julani 's organization recently carried out a wave of arrest of around a thousand activist from various opposition organization in the province , including activist who had previously belonged to his organization . The released detainee reported severe torture of prisoner who were arrested on suspicion of collaborating with the Assad regime . Analysts attribute the deteriorating situation to the lack of a political solution and a significant reduction in international aid to the province in recent month . This crisis wa created due to the uncompromising and unyielding stance of the zealous jihadist ruler Julani , who is not willing to make any political concession . The current wave of protest openly call for the overthrow of Julani 's oppressive rule , which some compare to the repression of the Assad regime.The protester claim that the current situation is even worse than during Assad 's rule because it also includes religious repression in the style of ISIS . The protester demand the establishment of a local council to run the province . HTS is now trying to calm the protest by releasing more prisoner , monitoring price increase , and easing some tax . However , it seems that the protest have spiraled out of control and are only gaining momentum.Interpreters from the Lebanese Al-Mayadeen outlet revealed that behind the protest stand Turkey , which aim to undermine the control of Idlib from the hand of Julani and return it to the Free Syrian Army under Ankara 's direct control . The recent development undoubtedly weaken Julani , who still control about 75 % of Idlib . This mark the breakdown of the coalition after many year of unity.An opportunity for Assad , a problem for HezbollahThe division , anarchy , and turmoil in the Idlib region undoubtedly present a golden opportunity for control in Damascus , which may not return . Now Assad 's army could potentially enter the region with significant support to restore it to the embrace of the regime , after almost a decade of neglect . However , this would require substantial support force . For the occupation of Idlib , a significant asset for the Assad regime in particular , and the `` resistance axis `` in general , Iran would need to send substantial force . These force mainly include Shi'ite Popular Mobilization Unit militia from Iraq and Hezbollah force from Lebanon . However , Hezbollah can not afford a two-front war.Now , Iran 's axis of resistance , the Syrian regime , and Shi'ite militia face a crossroad : whether to continue the war in the Israeli arena or redirect force to northern Syria ? In the case of the Israel front , it is a purposeless war with Hezbollah already suffering over 230 casualty and no achievement against the highly motivated and prepared IDF . In the case of Idlib , however , it present an opportunity for a significant strategic victory against the disintegrating opposition.Will the Syrian arena affect our northern border ? Will Hezbollah agree to a compromise on our border in order to turn it attention to Syria ? Only time will tell.Dr .

And a the ongoing Israel-Hamas War show , the conflict 's importance and intensity show no sign of slowing down . & nbsp ; But what is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ? Where did it start ? Who are the key player involved ? & nbsp ; Here is everything you need to know.Where is Israel ? Israel is a country in the Middle East , specifically in the Levant region . It is steeped in thousand of year of history and ha been the home of numerous civilization and religious faiths.Israel is bordered by Egypt , Jordan , Lebanon , Syria , and the Palestinian territory and is on the coast of both the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . & nbsp ; While most country consider it capital to be Tel Aviv , Israel and a few other country , such a the United States , recognize Jerusalem a the capital.Where is Palestine ? Palestine is a self-proclaimed country , recognized largely a the Palestinian territory , located in the Middle East , specifically on the west bank of the Jordan River ( known colloquially a the West Bank ) and in a region along the Mediterranean coast known a the Gaza Strip . It is bordered by Israel , Jordan , and Egypt , with the Gaza Strip being on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea . & nbsp ; Though it proclaims Jerusalem a it capital , it de facto capital is Ramallah in the West Bank.Where is Gaza ? Gaza , known a the Gaza Strip , is a part of the Palestinian territory and is located along the Mediterranean coast . It border Israel and Egypt and ha three border crossing : the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossing with Israel and the Rafah crossing with Egypt.Has Israel recognized Palestine ? Israel ha refused to recognize a Palestinian state , though progress had been made following the Oslo Accords . & nbsp ; Currently , Israel officially support the idea of a two-state solution . Still , it is at odds with the proposed Palestinian border , a well a the issue of Israeli settlement in the West Bank and the possibility of Palestinian terrorist attack against Israel . & nbsp ; However , Israel doe recognize Palestinian control over certain part of the West Bank.Does Palestine recognize Israel ? Palestine technically doe recognize Israel , with then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat announcing it a such in 1988 . This wa reaffirmed following the signing of the Oslo Accords . However , the Palestinian leadership continues to have strong opposition to the State of Israel , and many Palestinian faction disagree with the recognition of Israel.Israel is oftentimes referred to by these body a the `` Zionist occupation . `` What is the Palestinian Authority ? The Palestinian Authority is the official ruling entity in the Palestinian territory . It is led by President Mahmoud Abbas and is controlled by his Fatah party . & nbsp ; The PA is based in Ramallah and exercise control over the Palestinian-run area of the West Bank , a well a claiming control over the Gaza Strip . & nbsp ; The government wa meant to be an interim body rather than a permanent political entity . & nbsp ; Officially a democracy , the Palestinian Authority is , in practice , an authoritarian entity , not having had election since 2006 , with further attempt at having election never actually manifesting . & nbsp ; Abbas wa elected to a four-year term in 2005 , though his term in office ha continued for almost two decade at the time of writing . & nbsp ; The PA ha also been accused of violating human right , censoring a free press , and engaging in widespread corruption . & nbsp ; Currently , the PA is fractured following the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary election , which saw the terrorist group and party Hamas win control of the parliament . Since then , a schism ha erupted between Fatah and Hamas , and attempt at mending this split have been unsuccessful.What is Hamas ? Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist terrorist group that wa founded in 1987 by Ahmed Yassin . Its origin lie in a Muslim charity organization , Mujama al-Islamiya , affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood organization . & nbsp ; Since it official founding in 1987 , Hamas ha become infamous for it terrorist activity and it staunch refusal to recognize Israel 's right to exist . & nbsp ; Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary election , but the Palestinian Authority dissolved the government and replaced it with a Fatah-led one , leading to the schism mentioned above.Hamas ha fought several armed conflict with Israel since taking over Gaza , with the current ongoing war being sparked by Hamas 's attack on southern Israel on October 7 , 2023 , which saw 1,200 people in Israel killed and 250 people taken hostage . & nbsp ; Hamas 's leadership is spread out between Gaza and Qatar . Its leader in Gaza is Yahya Sinwar , while the organization 's overall political leader is Ismail Haniyeh.When did the Israeli-Palestinian conflict begin ? The starting point of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the subject of fierce debate since many believe the Palestinian national identity did n't begin until the middle of the 20th century . In contrast , others believe the Israeli national identity did not technically exist until the establishment of the State of Israel . & nbsp ; What is agreed upon , though , is that Jews and Arabs have conflicted with one another in the region since the late 19th and early 20th century . & nbsp ; This coincided with the arrival of Jewish Zionist settler into the future State of Israel to escape antisemitic persecution in Europe . At the time , the land wa ruled over by the Ottoman Empire , though by the end of World War I , the British took it over and instituted the British Mandate of Palestine . & nbsp ; Over the coming decade , the two demographic would grow increasingly in conflict a tension grew , with the Arabs staging multiple revolt in the mandate . In 1947 , a plan wa proposed by the British to partition Israel into Jewish and Arab state . The Jews agreed , but the Arabs did not . & nbsp ; A year later , Israel declared independence , and war wa declared . Surrounded on all side by enemy nation , Israel proved victorious , and many Arabs ended up fleeing their home - an event Palestinians refer to today a the Nakba . & nbsp ; Tensions exploded in the late 1980s a Palestinians launched the First Intifada , an uprising aimed at lashing out at what they perceived a an oppressive Israeli occupation . The intifada ended with the signing of the Oslo Accords , which many hoped would lead to a lasting peace . However , fierce opposition by hardliner among both Israelis and Palestinians prevented this , particularly with the assassination of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and the election of a new right-wing Israeli government.In 2000 , the Second Intifada started up , lasting several year and seeing multiple casualty . It ultimately ended following the unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip , though it continues to have control over Gaza 's border and airspace.While the most visible part of the conflict now take place in Gaza , there is still considerable tension among Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem , where terrorist attack and bout of violence still occur.Are Israel and Palestine fighting over Gaza ? The ongoing Israel-Hamas War is fought largely in the Gaza Strip , but it is not a fight `` over `` Gaza . Only a small minority of Israeli lawmaker are calling for the full annexation of Gaza . Rather , the ongoing war is over the eradication of Hamas and the freeing of the hostage held in Gaza .",everything you need to know about the israeli-palestinian conflict

2024-03-16 07:16:02.000,jpost,"The six small stand-up box contain three-dimensional doll in Inca costume , complete with their traditional design and surrounded by ceramic pot , also in the traditional style . Highly colorful , these miniature doll are amazingly made out of potato flour ! Peruvian artist Zuly Jimenez had been asked by Jerusalem-based artist David Moss to illustrate the Purim story a told in the Scroll of Esther a if it were set in the artist & rsquo ; s own surroundings . Jimenez decided to root her interpretation in Peru & rsquo ; s ancient culture , which meant going back to a time when the Incas ruled the land . One innovation among many wa the depiction of Haman leading Mordechai sitting on a llama , since , a she explained , the horse had not been introduced into this part of the world until the Spaniards came and conquered Peru.The experience of making these model wa for Jimenez & ldquo ; unforgettable & rdquo ; in that it combined art and history , legend and story-telling . It wa precisely the reaction that Moss wa looking for and had already received from his many guest artist from around the world over the previous thirty year when he started this unique project . & ldquo ; In 1990 , I wa in Bali , Indonesia , & rdquo ; he recalled , & ldquo ; searching for craftspeople for another project of mine , when I viewed the beautiful miniature being produced by the local artist . Bali , a traditional Hindu society , is full of palace , royalty , prince and princess , ceremony and ritual . All these thing strongly reminded me of the story of Esther and Purim . So when I went back the second time , I asked artist from two different village to do their take on the story . I gave them parchment and the story of Esther translated into Indonesian . I drew six small blank rectangle and I told them to imagine that this story wa happening right in their village . The six scene I asked them to envisage included Achashverus & rsquo ; s party at the beginning of the story ; the beauty contest in which Esther participates and win ; the reaching out of the scepter by the king to Esther ; Haman leading Mordechai on the king & rsquo ; s horse ; the hanging of Haman & rsquo ; s ten son ; and the writing out of the megilla to go out to all the land of the king & rsquo ; s massive kingdom . I didn & rsquo ; t want them to imagine Persia or anything to do with the original story . It had to be local in their own culture and style . I waited for the response . When I viewed the stunningly original crafted image they had produced , it gave me another thought : Perhaps I could expand this idea by seeking out folk artist from around the world willing to depict these same six scene in their own vernacular culture and style . Thus began a fascinating , bizarre thirty-year quest I & rsquo ; ve come to call Esther without Borders , & rdquo ; said Moss.Esther without BordersAlthough it wa initially happenstance that energized the beginning of the project , Moss & rsquo ; s enthusiasm only grew a he encountered folk artist from around the world who responded positively to his strange request . In the course of his ongoing project , he encountered artist from Ukraine , Russia , Bali , India , Italy , Ecuador , Colombia , Panama , California , New Mexico , and so on , thus echoing the megilla & rsquo ; s Achashveros , whose kingdom spread from & ldquo ; Hodu to Kush & rdquo ; ( India to Ethiopia ) . The original Purim ha a profoundly universal flavor . & ldquo ; I initially sought out folk artist , & rdquo ; said Moss , & ldquo ; although I & rsquo ; ve asked a few professional artist , too . Another change came about when I approached an artist in Italy whose charming work I had spotted in a small exhibition in the Piedmont region . He said he & rsquo ; d love to do the project but that he could not work in the miniature format I had been requesting . I told him to use whatever format he liked . He wa very imaginative , created a delightful accordion book , and also drew the main character from the story on the back of the work . He had a great sense of humor , depicting the eunuch of the king , for example , with a pair of scissors on his turban ! & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Once the mold wa broken , I let the rest of the artist do the image in whatever format they were most comfortable with . This came to mean the project ha been done on tile , fabric , icon , and envelope , a well a on paper and parchment . & rdquo ; Although Moss is a much traveled artist , the language of communication with the artist doe sometimes present problem . & ldquo ; With the Italian artist , I found a nearby gallery owner who helped locate and communicate with the artist . I use Google Translate to communicate with many of the artist . Fortunately , the Book of Esther is also in the Christian Bible , which ha been translated into hundred of language . I send the artist the entire book in their own language and highlight the six verse , & rdquo ; he explained . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; A friend wa headed off to Australia , and I asked her to propose the project to an Aboriginal artist if she came across one . She found Emma Burchill , a wonderful artist who did the project in their highly abstract , symbolic style . She explained to me how the Aborigines paint their work using dot a if they were looking down at the scene from a bird & rsquo ; s eye view . Therefore , she showed the feast viewed from above a their campfire , with the guest dancing the traditional corrobbree ceremony around the fire . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; He did not have to travel for every artist . Some came to him in his studio in Huzot Hayotzer beneath the wall of the Old City of Jerusalem . Moss met Boris Gozzo , a talented Ukrainian artist living in Israel whose illustration portrayed some of the men in the scene a drunken peasants.Most year , the art studio in Huzot Hayotzer play host to an international art and craft fair , so it wa that Moss met Rajendra Kumar Moktan from Nepal whose expertise is in the creation of mandela & ndash ; prayer wheel used in Buddhist and Hindu sacred rite and a an instrument of meditation . The detailed scene he painted on canvas truly convey the ceremony of Nepalese culture . & nbsp ; When I met Moss in his somewhat overcrowded studio , he had just got off the phone with a woman from Portugal . & ldquo ; Her name is Teresa , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; She work on Azulejo tile in the blue and white ceramic tradition from the 17th and 18th century . They were influenced by Delft tile . She had just sent me a sketch of what she is doing and wrote to me that she wa finishing the last tile . She had painted the station of the cross in ceramic for her local cathedral and the tile for the Esther story were done in this strong Portuguese , Christian tradition . & rdquo ; Not that every encounter is successful . & ldquo ; I tried a Chinese artist but didn & rsquo ; t like what he did . I & rsquo ; ll have to go back there and try someone else . Also , although I pay the artist whatever fee they request , if they ask more than I can afford , I let it go , & rdquo ; he said.It is perhaps not surprising that some of these artist became firm friend . & ldquo ; In Morro Bay , California , I met Philip Carey , who specialized in drawing delightful miniature scene on envelope and mailing them to their destination via the post office . They are whimsical and full of humor . I marveled how he translated the Esther story into his envelope art . He portrayed each of the figure a being from the animal world . So his king is a Monarch butterfly , Esther is a Morro Bay sea otter , Mordechai a bald eagle riding on a sea horse , Haman is depicted a a coyote , and so forth . Esther sends out the Purim story by & lsquo ; seamail & rsquo ; on seahorse , and & lsquo ; landmail & rsquo ; with roadrunner . Philip executed all these envelope image in ink and colored pencil and then sent them to me through the post office . We were in close contact over the year , but tragically he ha passed away . I treasure these miniature masterpiece that so embody who he wa . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Although Moss wa happy to give many of these artist some visibility , he came upon one group of unknown artist who had simply disappeared . These were the Mimbres , an extinct civilization from southern New Mexico who flourished between 1,000 and 1,150 CE and then vanished , leaving behind no writing . All that remains of them are the ruin of their building and their black-and-white pottery with unique stylized design . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I wa always captivated by the powerful design they left behind , and felt that it wa somehow unfair that I wa limiting my project to living culture . I decided to imagine myself a an ancient Mimbres artist and designed the six Esther scene a round , bowl-like image based on what wa recovered from their tradition , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; Moss , an internationally recognized book artist , calligrapher , designer of ketubot and architectural design , appreciates how he ha succeeded sufficiently well to have the ability and willingness to help fellow artist who were not so fortunate . At the same time , he ha not rushed this project nor doe he have future plan for it . & ldquo ; I love that there is no end , goal , or deadline to this , & rdquo ; he confessed . & ldquo ; People have suggested that I turn it into a book , others that it should be exhibited . My daughter Elyssa run a center opposite my studio called Kol HaOt , which brings together art and Judaism . We did do a small show of these work there . But the beauty of this project for me is in the remarkable people it ha connected me with , the thrill and surprise of opening each new contribution , and the sheer joy of watching a simple idea unfold and blossom in so many surprising way . & rdquo ; Whichever way Moss decides , it would indeed be a pity if this impressive project were not viewed by a much larger audience . But maybe , a he joke , he & rsquo ; s going to wait until he reach 127 nation & ndash ; from India to Ethiopia and beyond ! ■",david moss 's purim project : esther without border
2021-01-28 16:24:13.983,jpost,"An angry & quot ; protest note & quot ; from Jordan ha demanded that Israel stop hindering restoration work at Jerusalem @ @ @ s al-Aqsa mosque compound , Islam @ @ @ s third holiest site . Jordanian foreign ministry spokesman Daifallah Alfayez said the note sent on Monday urged Israel to & quot ; refrain from such violation and provocation , and respect the mandate of Jordan in administering Muslim holy site . & quot ; Israeli official did not respond to request from The Media Line for comment . Jordan & rsquo ; s King Abdullah II is the custodian of Muslim holy site in east Jerusalem , an arrangement agreed upon in the 1994 peace deal between the two country . Under the agreement , Israel recognizes Jordan @ @ @ s guardianship of Islamic and Christian holy site in east Jerusalem , which wa captured and annexed by Israel in 1967 . Wakf , the Islamic endowment authority run by Jordan , this week accused the Israel Police of preventing it employee from conducting restoration work on the Dome of the Rock shrine . Jordan insists that the Wakf is & quot ; the sole authority responsible for the supervision and maintenance of al-Aqsa . & quot ; Jawad Anani , a former deputy prime minister and former foreign minister of Jordan , told The Media Line from Amman that Jordan @ @ @ s role in east Jerusalem is a redline for the king . & quot ; The Jerusalem issue for His Majesty the King is very important . Islamic and Christian holy place in Jerusalem are under Hashemite guardianship , & quot ; he said . Anani , who also served a chief of the Royal Court , and coordinator of Jordan & rsquo ; s peace negotiating team with Israel , say that Israeli domestic politics is a factor in the rising tension . & quot ; We see this a a challenge for Jordan and His Majesty . The reason is that the current Israeli administration is seeking to gain vote , because ( Prime Minister Benjamin ) Netanyahu is in a difficult and critical situation . He try to appease the extremist and religious people in Israel , & quot ; he said . Oded Eran , a former Israeli ambassador to Jordan , concedes that the relationship between the two country is at it lowest point . & quot ; I think the relation are not frozen , but I would say quite cold , & quot ; he said . Eran , who wa Israel @ @ @ s top diplomat in Amman from 1997 to 2000 , say that despite their problem , the two country cooperate on some issue , including intelligence and security . & quot ; There are contact between the two ministry of foreign affair , the minister met twice in recent month , and they discussed cooperation on many issue , & quot ; he said . But Abdullah and Netanyahu have not spoken to each other for some time , he added , which say a lot about the state of relation between the two country . He compare this to the & ldquo ; warmth & rdquo ; of the relationship between the late Jordanian King Hussein and the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin . Anani said that there is & ldquo ; no chemistry & rdquo ; between the current king and prime minister . & quot ; The relationship ha gone nowhere since Netanyahu took office . Full of challenge , there is a long list of action that Netanyahu took that indicate his animosity , & quot ; he said . Unpopular among the majority of Jordanians , the 26-year-old peace treaty ha withstood the test of time , in spite of increased tension between Israel and Jordan in the last few year . The rising animosity between Jordan and Israel come at a time when Israel is normalizing relation with four Arab state . & quot ; Jordan found itself alone in standing firmly behind the Palestinian cause , while other Arab country are normalizing relation with Israel , & quot ; Eran said . He added that these breakthrough accord should help Jordan , too . & quot ; The addition of Arab state to the circle of normalization with Israel open up the possibility of regional economic cooperation for which Jordan can certainly benefit in many sector , & quot ; he said . Eran say good relation with Jordan should be a top priority for Israel . & quot ; It is a very sad comment on the current state of affair and one can only hope that a resumption of a political process a soon a possible between Israel and the Palestinians will also bring greater cooperation between Israel and Jordan , & quot ; he said . When Trump rolled out his vision for peace in the Middle East last January , he did it with little to no consultation with Abdullah . Making matter worse , there wa the US position approving of Israeli plan to annex the West Bank portion of the Jordan Valley , which Amman strongly reject , calling it a threat to it national security . Under the Trump Administration , Jordan & rsquo ; s role in the region wa marginalized . Trump bypassed the strategic relationship that the US had with the kingdom for decade , in favor of Gulf state . & quot ; No one can exclude or circumvent Jordan & rsquo ; s role in Jerusalem . There is no contesting of the Hashemite custody of the Holy Places , & quot ; Anani said .","tension growing between israel , jordan over al-aqsa restoration work"

Pinocchio & rsquo ; s nose grew longer every time he told a lie.Israeli newspaper cartoonist apparently came up with a similar idea . For some year now , they have been depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with an abnormally long nose . In actual fact , the prime minister & rsquo ; s nose is not unusual in size , but he doe have a tendency to arrogate to himself declaration and deed , the credit for which belongs to others.Surprising Purim tradition & nbsp ; Not everyone is aware that there is more than one Purim and even more than two or three . Prior to the reading of the Scroll of Esther , or the Megillah a it & rsquo ; s generally known , at the Yad Vashem synagogue in Jerusalem , two senior staff from Yad Vashem & rsquo ; s guiding department , Naama Galil and Yochai Copenhagen , presented an intriguing lesson on the history of Purim , how it is celebrated and commemorated in different country and the special delicacy that are eaten.The reading of the scroll wa done by Prof . Jonathan Halevy , the president of Shaare Zedek Medical Center , whose style and perfect enunciation make him a much in demand Torah reader at various Jerusalem synagogues.The Yad Vashem synagogue , designed by prizewinning , internationally acclaimed , Israeli-born architect Moshe Safdie , is in itself a mini museum , showcasing sacred item that are remnant of European synagogue destroyed during the Holocaust . The synagogue serf a an archive of memory to the once-flourishing Jewish community of Europe . It is also a place for personal prayer in memory of relative who were murdered or who perished in the ghetto and the camps.The synagogue ha superb acoustic & ndash ; something that is not always taken into account in design of building for public use.In the Balkans , according to the two Yad Vashem representative , every time the Jewish community wa saved from a massacre through some apparent miracle , another Purim wa declared.The special cooky that are eaten on Purim , known a hamentashen , were originally called mohntashen & ndash ; poppy-seed pocket ; and in country where Ladino is spoken rather than Yiddish or Hebrew , the recipe are somewhat different , and so are the names.There are four essential Purim commandment : to read or attend a reading of the Megillah ; to be joyful while simultaneously remembering attempt by despot to eliminate the Jews from the face of the earth ; to exchange gift of food ; and to provide for the poor.Most of the people who attended the Purim service at the Yad Vashem synagogue were child Holocaust survivor , and quite a few came dressed in the Purim spirit.The evening concluded with a merry klezmer recital by Omri Rivlin and Vladimir Czeczlinski.On display , in front of the ark , wa a centuries-old Scroll of Esther discovered and rescued from the Krakow Ghetto in March 1943.Legend ha it that there wa also a Queen Esther in Krakow , though there is no absolute proof . However , there is a street named after her in the old Jewish Quarter of Krakow . According to the story , she wa exceedingly beautiful and caught the eye of King Casimir the Great . The main clue to any truth in the story is that Jews suffered great persecution in 14th-century Poland , and that after Casimir fell in love with Esther , persecution ceased . Esterka , a she wa called , is referred to in both Jewish and Polish historical literature.Herzog delivers Megillah reading & nbsp ; In any given week , President Isaac Herzog travel the length and breadth of the country , but for the Megillah reading on Sunday night , all he had to do wa cross the road to the synagogue at the Theatron hotel , which is directly opposite the rear entrance to the President & rsquo ; s Residence . Services are held daily in the beautifully appointed synagogue , and in recent month attendance ha been gratifying , a nearly all the guest room are occupied by evacuee , most of whom are traditional in their religious observance.Joining Herzog at the service were evacuee from Kiryat Shmona , Sderot , and Shlomi.Herzog greeted the congregant , saying that it wa very emotional for him to meet them , to strengthen them , and in particular to assure those from the North that he is well aware that they are living through a period of great uncertainty . He offered them encouragement in the knowledge that in the final analysis they would all return home in peace and by the grace of God . & ldquo ; We all pray and work toward the speedy return of the hostage , & rdquo ; he said , quoting Maimonides . & ldquo ; There is no greater deed than liberating captive . & rdquo ; He also called for the strengthening of the Israel Defense Forces on land , sea , and in the air . His final appeal wa for the preservation of national unity and love of Israel.The return of Adloyada & nbsp ; There wa considerable controversy in Jerusalem this year a to whether to hold an Adloyada parade during wartime . Those in favor said that the somber atmosphere of the nation should not be imposed on child , and that they should be allowed to celebrate and have fun . & nbsp ; Those against said it would be a travesty to parade through the street of the capital in joy , while the hostage kidnapped by Hamas were still languishing in Gaza.The various argument prompted Aryeh Halivni , the founder of Toldot Israel , the anthology of Israel & rsquo ; s contemporary history , to release an item about the beginning of the Adloyada tradition.For those who may not be aware , it & rsquo ; s customary to drink alcoholic beverage on Purim till one reach the stage of losing awareness . & ldquo ; Adloyada & rdquo ; is a conglomerate of three Hebrew word literally translated a & ldquo ; till he didn & rsquo ; t know . & rdquo ; The excerpt from Toldot Israel read a follows : & ldquo ; In December 1931 , the Tel Aviv Municipality held a contest to choose a new name for the annual Purim festival . Suggestions came in from such noted author a Bialik , Tchernichovsky , and Avraham Shlonsky . The winning entry came from Yitzhak Dov Berkowitz , Sholem Aleichem & rsquo ; s son-in-law , and himself an Israel Prize-winning author . & ldquo ; & lsquo ; Adloyada & rsquo ; is a contraction of & lsquo ; ad d & rsquo ; lo yada , & rsquo ; the Aramaic word in the Talmud that encourage drinking on Purim until one no longer know the difference between blessed is Mordechai and cursed is Haman . The name stuck , and to this day , Purim celebration throughout Israel are known a the & lsquo ; Adloyada . & rsquo ; & rdquo ; Purim history & nbsp ; Currently doing the round on electronic medium is a story about a Purim song . During Purim 1954 , Moshe Sharett , who wa then prime minister , came to the Milo Club , which wa then the cultural center of the Labor Party , and saw that everyone wa in a dejected mood.Five year earlier , Yigal Alon had sent a cable to Israel & rsquo ; s first prime minister , David Ben-Gurion , informing him of the conquest of Eilat.Following five-year anniversary celebration , a busload of merrymaker who were returning home , on March 17 , 1954 , which coincided with the eve of Purim , wa attacked by terrorist , plunging the whole country into shock , fear , and grief . Eleven of the passenger were murdered . . The tragedy hung like a cloud over planned festivity . The Purim party at the Milo Club at 16 Zamenhoff Street wa anything but cheerful.In the crowd , Sharett caught sight of songwriter Ya & rsquo ; akov Orland and Mordechai Zeira , who were then the celebrity songwriter of the nation , and whose work are still popular today . Sharett grabbed them by the arm , dragged them into the kitchenette , gave them a bottle of brandy , and demanded that they write a happy song to change the mood . He left them alone , and a he closed the door he told them not to exit until they could come up with a new , happy song.After a short time , the two emerged with the song written on a paper serviette . They started to perform it for Sharett , who wa the product of a musical family . He immediately caught the tune , took a clarinet from the band and accompanied them.Returning to Israel post-pandemicBefore Covid , New Yorkers Leslie and Fern Penn used to come to Israel at least once every two year . For Leslie it wa purely a vacation and a mean of boning up on his knowledge of Zionist history and of Israel . For Fern , it wa a mix of business and pleasure.The couple used to be the proprietor of a Made in Israel fashion , accessory and giftware store , and Fern & rsquo ; s foray to Israel were to look at merchandise in the abovementioned category . She made friend with Israeli designer , and even after she and Leslie gave up their enterprise due to soaring rent in the Big Apple , Fern remained involved with Israel by leading food and fashion tour to Israel.But then came the pandemic , during which many international airline service were suspended , and any plan the couple had for visiting Israel were put on hold.They finally returned to Israel last week , after an eight-year hiatus . It wa not the Israel they remembered , though their two favorite hotel , the Dan in Tel Aviv and the King David in Jerusalem , still carried the quiet luxury aura of decade past , even though each had undergone subtle renovations.But street in both city had changed . Where once there had been single-story cottage , or three - or four-story apartment building , tall tower now dominate the skyline , and new street have been created in some places.In New York , Leslie is the executive director of the Conservative Synagogue of Fifth Avenue , of which he wa previously the longtime president . Fern prefers the Orthodox synagogue in Riverdale led by Rabbi Avi Weiss , and known a the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale , or the Bayit . But Riverdale is too far from her home to walk , so she go to the Conservative Synagogue on Fifth Avenue on Shabbat and other Jewish holy day , and to the Avi Weiss synagogue on weekday , where congregant have made Links of Love crocheted multicolored necklace strand to give to evacuee in Israel.Fern brought 100 of these necklace with her to distribute to evacuee in the hotel where she and Leslie stayed . The congregant also made gift for soldier and family of hostages.Jews all over New York want to do something for Israel , said Fern , who is thinking of leading another food and fashion tour , if she can persuade people to shake off their fear of coming to Israel.Meanwhile , she want to make contact with the Kadar Foundation which late last year sought to promote awareness of the plight of the Israeli hostage with bouquet of hope made up of yellow flower . The project , which began in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv , spread to the United States , where proceeds from sale are transferred directly to the family of the hostage . Fern belief that if she and Avraham Kadar put their head together , they can come up with some more awareness-raising initiatives.October 7 family speak outBeing famous is no guarantee that member of the government will come to your side in a time of trouble . Soccer commentator Shlomo Scharf , in an interview with Shalom Kital on KAN Reshet Bet radio , mentioned that after his granddaughter wa murdered by Hamas on October 7 , not a single member of the government came to pay a condolence call . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s a terrible thing when a grandparent ha to bury a grandchild , & rdquo ; said the former soccer player , coach of the national team , and the coach who led Maccabi Haifa to three championships.Meanwhile , he ha donated an ambulance to the Haifa Home for Holocaust survivor , to be used free of charge whenever one of the resident requires hospitalization . He is also a regular visitor to the home , assisting it resident with their various needs.Celebrations with the Baha ' i community & nbsp ; Like many other movement , organization , and institution , the Baha & rsquo ; i International Community , which last week celebrated it new year and the coming of spring , debated what kind of celebration it should have this year in view of the circumstance , or whether it should have a celebration at all , said David Rutstein the BIC secretary-general.In the final analysis , it wa decided to go ahead , but on a somewhat lower key than usual . This wa evident both in the floral decoration and in the musical entertainment.In past year , mini garden have been established in the lobby leading to the banquet room at the David Citadel Hotel in Jerusalem , where the BIC always celebrates it new year or Nowruz , a it is called in Persian.This year , the floral creation were subdued and consisted of two garden patch , each with a large yellow centerpiece to symbolize the hoped-for return of the hostages.There appeared to be more guest than in year gone by , including Russian Ambassador Anatoly Viktorov , who , socially speaking , ha paid the price for his president & rsquo ; s folly . He could not have known of the tragedy that would strike his country the following day.Following the terrorist attack in a Moscow concert hall , President Herzog called Viktorov to offer his condolence to the family of the dead , and sincere wish to all the wounded for a speedy recovery.Herzog condemned in the strongest term the barbaric terrorist attack perpetrated in Moscow , and emphasized that terrorism of any kind , especially jihadist terrorism , indiscriminately target all people , of all belief and religion , while sowing fear and destruction.Fighting terrorism is a major international challenge , and the country of the world must fight it together , he said.Chefs at the David Citadel outdid themselves in presentation and flavor . A piquant mullet wa reminiscent of highly spiced chraime , and the poached salmon with a semi sweet sauce wa delicious . The colorful fruit platter with a rich assortment of top-quality fruit were a feast to both the eye and the palate . There wa also a variety of meat dish for carnivore , but vegetarian and some of the people who had abstained from eating during the day , during the Fast of Esther , avoided the meat for fear that it might be too difficult to digest after a fast.BIC deputy secretary-general Ariane Sabet explained that the new year fall at the beginning of spring , which is the season of renewal , the season in which there is less darkness and more light.Representing the government wa Eyal Sisso , the director-general of the Population and Immigration Authority , who wa born and raised in Haifa , where he frequently visited the Baha & rsquo ; i Gardens . Commenting on the & ldquo ; strong and important relation between Baha & rsquo ; i and Israel , & rdquo ; he said that he is happy to welcome Baha & rsquo ; i volunteer from around the world to Israel.Underscoring the difficulty of celebrating while the hostage are still suffering in captivity , Sisso said : & ldquo ; We pray daily for their return . & rdquo ; Several of the Baha & rsquo ; i volunteer wore the national costume of their respective countries.Singing with soldiersAmong Israel 's most popular community singer is Einat Sarouf , who in her youth wa a great fan of Yaffa Yarkoni , who she say remains her source of inspiration , and she will be playing Yarkoni in a Habima musical during the summer.Meanwhile , before she figuratively step into Yarkoni & rsquo ; s shoe , she ha been singing to and with the troop and civilian in the same manner a Yarkoni , who died in January 2012.She ha also been traveling to America to raise the morale of Jewish community and Israeli expatriate . Israelis living in New York and Miami have turned up in drove to her concert there , and , according to interview Sarouf ha given to the Israeli medium , some actually weep over the line in the national anthem declaring that our hope is not yet lost . It & rsquo ; s a line that applies perfectly to the present situation.Dermer speaks on roleStrategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer posted on X ( formerly Twitter ) : & ldquo ; When I wa Israel & rsquo ; s ambassador to Washington , I must have met more than 160 other ambassador . I never met the ambassador of Babylon , never met the ambassador of Imperial Rome , and I didn & rsquo ; t meet the ambassador of the 1,000-year Reich . But there is an ambassador of Israel . We will survive this enemy . & rdquo ; Bibi-bashing indulgence ? Former US ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk , who twice served in that position , appears to be indulging in subtle Bibi-bashing ( some might consider it Israel-bashing ) via his X account . If he keep it up , it will only serve to increase support for Netanyahu.Israelis of all stripe are permitted to indulge in Bibi bashing , but not anyone from abroad , even if that someone happens to be Jewish . It & rsquo ; s something like a parent being permitted to say anything negative about his or her child , but woe betide anyone else who take the liberty of deriding or chastising that same child . Israelis can say terrible thing about Bibi , but will take a tough stand against non-Israelis who dare to do the same.Packing and sending mishloah manot & nbsp ; It would be a reasonably safe bet to say that more Purim gift package of pastry , cake , candy , chocolate , fruit , and wine were delivered in Israel this year than the usual average . Good-hearted Israelis and people from abroad sought to bring cheer to evacuee displaced for indefinite period from their home , reservist in the IDF , and soldier who have been wounded.When the ANU & ndash ; Museum of the Jewish People came up with an idea to involve it friend & rsquo ; organization in Israel , the US , and elsewhere in an initiative that would cater to all the aforementioned category , expectation were that sufficient fund would be raised for a few hundred gift parcel . In the final analysis , 2,100 gift package or mishloah manot , a they & rsquo ; re called in Hebrew , were distributed by museum employee to patient in hospital from Jerusalem to Beersheba , a well a to displaced person in hotel around the country.The initiative wa in partnership with Foodish , the culinary unit of the museum , which baked pastry and prepared other food item , and made sure to purchase ingredient from reservist in the food industry.Foodish CEO Merav Oren said that such enthusiasm had not been anticipated , but she wa delighted with this.Freed Israeli hostage speaks out & nbsp ; Last week at the United Nations Human Rights Council , B & rsquo ; nai B & rsquo ; rith International , the B & rsquo ; nai B & rsquo ; rith World Center-Jerusalem , and B & rsquo ; nai B & rsquo ; rith & rsquo ; s Office of United Nations Affairs facilitated remark by freed Israeli hostage Aviva Siegel , whose husband , Keith , remains in Hamas captivity in Gaza , and Ofri Bibas , whose multiple family member have remained captive for more than five month .

Bush between former prime minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas . & nbsp ; It wa at it lowest point in 1995 with only 36.9 % support , based on IDI data . & nbsp ; From July 27 to 29 , the IDI polled 750 Israelis over the age of 18 by phone and over the Internet , including 151 Arabic-speakers . The margin of error is 3.59 % for the poll on a wide array of topic , including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . & nbsp ; Participants were asked if they would back a & ldquo ; two-state solution with the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Israeli-Arabs were much more likely to support a two-state resolution than their Jewish peer . & nbsp ; Out of the 39.7 % who said they found such a resolution to the conflict acceptable , 33.8 % were Jewish Israelis and 68.8 % were Israeli-Arabs . & nbsp ; That answer flipped when it came to the 48 % of Israelis who opposed it , of which 53.6 % were Jewish and 20.5 % Arab . & nbsp ; The poll wa conducted in the absence of any peace process , with the United States and Israel appearing to prefer maintaining the status quo for the moment . & nbsp ; According to the IDI poll , out of the 37.1 % of Israelis who support maintenance of the status quo , 41.5 % were Jewish-Israelis and 15.4 % were Israeli-Arabs . & nbsp ; Similarly , Israeli-Arabs were more likely to oppose the status quo , with 69.5 % finding it unacceptable compared to the 37.2 % of Israeli Jews finding it acceptable .

2024-03-13 02:30:10.467,jpost,"Love struck Rusalka ( soprano Alla Vasilevitsky ) meet a handsome prince ( tenor Alexei Dolgov ) in the same-titled opera by Czech composer Anton & iacute ; n Dvor & aacute ; k , now offered at the Israeli Opera.Sadly , she is a mermaid and he is a human . When she attempt to touch him , he think she is a wave in a pool . To leave her realm , Rusalka trade with the witch woman Jezibaba ( mezzo-soprano Edna Prochnik ) , exchanging her voice for legs.Will the prince see how much she love him when she is mute , and she will gain a human soul , or will he reject this pale , sad , silent woman and condemn her to change again & ndash ; this time to a murdering bog spirit ? Delighting opera fan for over 100 yearsThis much beloved opera , with it mythical and folk aspect , ha delighted opera fan since it world premiere in 1901 . Director Stefano Poda ha adapted it in a visually stunning , powerful manner . More conventional adaptation & ndash ; like the 1977 Czech film by Peter Weigl , or the 2017 Met Opera production directed by Sir Mark Elder & ndash ; have character move on stage from forest pool to palace and back a if in a fairy tale ; Poda flood the stage and make it an actual pool.When Rusalka & rsquo ; s father , the water spirit Vodnik ( baritone Ionut Pascu ) emerges , he rise from that pool . The element of water is massive . The nymph lay down and roll around Vodnik , unable to rise since , in this mythic logic , they don & rsquo ; t have foot . Pascus is able to sing beautifully , inhabits the role of the grieving father who lament the loss of his daughter to the human realm , and jump to the pool without missing a beat . Good opera is hard ; to sing submerged in water is an Olympian feat.Starring in the title role , Vasilevitsky offered a wonderful performance from start to finish . It wa a delight to watch her interact with Prochnik in the role of Jezibaba.Poda & rsquo ; s vision had the witch walk with a collection of iron item attached to her dark dress . When she tear a dagger and offer it to a distressed Rusalka , encouraging her to murder her prince , we sense that Jezibaba is reliving a past trauma of her own.This is implied by her strong insistence that Rusalka is motivated only by desire , and the witch & rsquo ; s taunt that the prince & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; kissy-kisses & rdquo ; were not what the mermaid - turned-human expected . Rusalka , who actually want a soul , pretend the witch is wise and all-knowing to get her to help.One of the few major world opera performed in Czech , Jezibaba often speaks in a diminutive form . When she say to Rusalka & ldquo ; by the devil you will have foot , & rdquo ; what she is actually saying is & ldquo ; by the devil you will have footsie-wussies to walk with . & rdquo ; Prochnik & rsquo ; s performance of the aria & ldquo ; Cury mury fuk & rdquo ; ( roughly translated a & ldquo ; abracadabra & rdquo ; ) during the potion-making scene wa outstanding.A gargantuan production , some thing were lost due to it grandeur . When Jezibaba meet the hunter ( baritone Oded Reich ) and the kitchen apprentice ( mezzo soprano Rona Shrira ) , they are meant to be scared of her . It is very difficult to convince the audience they are frightened if they were told to collect plastic bag from the water pool and keep on singing when a scary , evil witch is speaking with them.Like Rusalka , who gave her voice in exchange for a shot at a human soul and true love , this production traded some of the familiar aspect of this opera to gift the audience with a larger-than-life production many will remember with deep gratitude for year to come.Anton & iacute ; n Dvor & aacute ; k & rsquo ; s & lsquo ; Rusalka & rsquo ; will perform daily until Thursday , March 14 , at 8 p.m . & ndash ; except for one Friday performance on March 15 , given at 1 p.m .

Voicing full support for the Bedouin citizen of the Negev , the PA and the Palestinian faction called for stepping up the protest against Israel & rsquo ; s practice . The tension erupted this week when Bedouin citizen protested the planting of tree by Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund on disputed land in the Negev . According to the Palestinians , the tree-planting in the Negev come in the context of Israel & rsquo ; s & ldquo ; settlement policy & rdquo ; and & ldquo ; crime & rdquo ; in the West Bank , Jerusalem and Gaza Strip . The PA and the Palestinian faction refer to the Arab Israelis , including the Bedouin , a & ldquo ; Palestinians & rdquo ; or & ldquo ; the Arabs of 1948 . & rdquo ; Some of the faction called on the Bedouin citizen to launch an intifada ( uprising ) in protest of the Israeli attempt to confiscate & ldquo ; Arab-owned land . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; The crime of the occupation state in the Negev are an extension of it war on the Palestinians , & rdquo ; the PA Foreign Ministry said in a statement . & ldquo ; The ministry strongly condemns the heinous crime committed by the occupation state against the Palestinian Arabs of the Negev and their land and property .

The PLO & rsquo ; s Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) also likened the Israeli measure in the Negev to the ongoing tension between the Palestinians , IDF soldier and settler in the West Bank . The PFLP praised the Bedouin citizen for & ldquo ; rising up in rejection of [ Israel & rsquo ; s ] decision to confiscate their land in favor of settlement project . & rdquo ; The PFLP called for & ldquo ; uniting all effort to confront this new project , which is a repetition of what happened with our people in Khan al-Ahmar . & rdquo ; KHAN AL-AHMAR is a Bedouin village located near Ma & rsquo ; aleh Adumim . In 2018 , the High Court of Justice ruled that the village can be evicted because it wa illegally constructed , a move that triggered a crisis and international outcry and resulted in the postponement of the demolition . The PFLP called for a & ldquo ; heroic response & rdquo ; of the Bedouin citizen in the Negev to Israel & rsquo ; s alleged plan to seize their land . It also called on the Bedouin citizen not to serve in the IDF . & ldquo ; We call on the mass of our people to mobilize and participate widely in the demonstration of anger that will start today [ Thursday ] and tomorrow [ Friday ] in the village and town of the occupied Negev , & rdquo ; the PFLP said .

2024-05-14 10:54:08.507,jpost,"Friday , May 14 , 1948 . The final hour of the British Mandate in Palestine ticked away . The mandate wa set to expire at midnight . David Ben-Gurion gave order for the ceremony to mark the birth of the Jewish state . He decided to make the historic declaration just before Shabbat came in.In the fevered atmosphere of the time , Ben-Gurion ’ s overriding concern wa security . If the location of the ceremony became public knowledge , a single terrorist bomb could wipe out the entire embryonic government of the new state , together with most of it notable . So it wa not until the middle of that Friday morning that official began telephoning the 200 people who had been selected to attend the ceremony . Only then were they told that it wa to take place in Tel Aviv ’ s Municipal Museum on Rothschild Boulevard , at exactly 4 p.m.Another 50 or so people also received a call that morning , instructing them to be present – the member of what wa then known a the Palestine Philharmonic Orchestra , comprised of Jewish musician – for by 1948 the national orchestra had become so identified with the Jewish people that an occasion of such historic significance wa unthinkable without their presence.ON MAY 15 , 1948 , the orchestra became the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra ( IPO ) , and it relationship with the people of Israel ha a deserved place in the reflection about nationhood , identity , and independence that mark Independence Day.As the National Council and the guest made their way to the ground floor area , the orchestra assembled in the museum ’ s upper gallery . At exactly 4 p.m . , Ben-Gurion rapped his gavel . This wa the prearranged signal for the orchestra to strike up “ Hatikvah . ” Unfortunately , someone missed the cue , and from above came only silence . Never one to lack initiative , Ben-Gurion promptly launched his uncertain voice into the anthem ; rather raggedly , the other member of the People ’ s Council joined in.But someone in the hall did respond to that gavel – a young radio engineer , Ralf Hellinger , who had been running the underground radio station of the Hagana , the clandestine Jewish self-defense force . Tipped off by American journalist about what wa to take place , Hellinger had arrived at the Tel Aviv museum that afternoon carting two of his cumbersome 78 rpm recording machine . After proclaiming the new State , Ben-Gurion invited the member of the People ’ s Council , one by one , to sign the document . As the last one put his name on the scroll , to thunderous applause , the orchestra finally made it presence known , and brought the proceeding to a close with “ Hatikvah . ” The audio recording of the event of that historic Friday afternoon have been preserved in the archive of the Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation , which today operates under the brand name Kan . When the musician assembled at the Municipal Museum that Friday afternoon , they did so a the Palestine Philharmonic Orchestra . By the time they played “ Hatikvah ” they had become the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra ( IPO ) . Give or take a few month , the orchestra itself wa 12 year old by that time . How had it come into existence ? IN THE early 1930s , Germany ’ s increasingly harsh race law roused the eminent violinist , Bronislaw Huberman , to a fury . In article and letter to the newspaper , he berated German intellectual for failing to make a stand for freedom of cultural expression ; and tried to mobilize world opinion against the Nazis ’ persecution of Jewish writer , artist , and musician . Finally , Huberman decided to do something practical to help those of his own profession who were being denied the right to perform inside the Third Reich . He began to persuade first-rank Jewish musician to emigrate to the Land of Israel , known then a Palestine . Against all the odds , he succeeded in setting up a viable orchestra , largely comprised of immigrant musician . Even more remarkably , Huberman wa able to persuade Arturo Toscanini , possibly the most eminent conductor in the world at that time , to conduct the opening concert of the orchestra . “ I am doing this for humanity , ” the maestro declared.The Unfinished by Franz Schubert ( 1797-1828 ) wa one of the two major work included in that first public performance by the orchestra on December 26 , 1936 . Present were the British high commissioner Lord Peel , Vera and Chaim Weizmann , Paula and David Ben-Gurion , and a vast audience , which included Signora Toscanini . The first year were not easy . Not only had the 75 player brought a wide diversity of style with them , but the diversity of language added further difficulty . Despite the problem , they quickly coalesced into an orchestra that renowned conductor were happy to lead , among others Bernardino Molinari ( 1880-1952 ) , William Steinberg ( 1889-1978 ) , and even Britain ’ s distinguished Malcolm Sargent ( 1895-1967 ) . The version of “ Hatikvah ” currently used by the orchestra is based on the orchestration by Sargent in those early days.While recognized remarkably early a a first-class orchestra , the Israel Philharmonic is today world-class . This transformation wa due to two towering figure in it history – famed conductor Leonard Bernstein and Zubin Mehta . The first a Jew , the latter a gentile , these two men share equal credit for forging the unique symbiosis between the orchestra and the people of Israel that is the outstanding characteristic of the IPO . No other top-flight orchestra in the world is so closely identified with it constituency a the Israel Philharmonic . City orchestra in the United States , the United Kingdom , Europe ; national orchestra in the Netherlands , Switzerland , and elsewhere , none are woven , a the IPO is , into the very fabric of their audience ’ s life . Where the Israeli people have gone , there ha been the orchestra , giving musical expression to the great event in the nation ’ s story.BERNSTEIN ARRIVED in Israel in October 1948 to open the first orchestral season in the State of Israel . The season included six special concert for service men and woman – the most spectacular in the town of Beersheba just captured from Egyptian troop . Braving bad road , sand and dust , the orchestra traveled from Tel Aviv with their own piano and played their concert on a makeshift stage before a thousand-strong audience of troops.That November , Bernstein broadcast from Israel to the United States . “ Last week , ” he said , “ we gave a concert in Jerusalem for soldier only . Imagine 2,000 soldier simultaneously given leave one morning in a city under siege ! “ Imagine them crowding into the Edison Theatre , filling every nook , suspended literally from the roof , curled up on window sash , packed into the aisle and staircase – all to hear a Brahms symphony . “ And at the end , the shouting and screaming wa an almost unbearable tribute . Yes , the orchestra is the lifeblood of Israeli culture , and I am dedicated to the task of seeing it flourish . ” That wa a commitment Bernstein honored to the full , in the year that followed.An unforgettable concert during the Six Day WarTOWARD THE end of May 1967 , with Israel ’ s Arab neighbor mobilizing on her border , the distinguished foreign conductor , who had been engaged for the summer concert series , took fright and hurriedly departed . In the middle of the six day of fighting that began on June 5 , Mehta arrived from Europe in a plane otherwise filled with ammunition , joining Daniel Barenboim and Jacqueline du Pré who were already performing with the orchestra . Close on their heel came Sir John Barbirolli and Bernstein.In July , with Jerusalem once again united , an unforgettable concert wa staged in the amphitheater on Mount Scopus . In the warm summer afternoon , before a packed audience that included then-prime minister Levi Eshkol and former prime minister Ben-Gurion , Bernstein conducted a performance of Mahler ’ s Resurrection symphony that life in the memory of those present a an almost unbearably moving experience.By this time , Mehta ’ s connection with the IPO wa strong , forged in his first season with the orchestra in 1961 . “ When I came on to the stage for the second rehearsal , ” he once recalled , “ the player applauded . ” How a musician from India , coming to this group of Jewish musician assembled from around the world , managed to ignite so extraordinary and lasting a chemistry is something of a mystery . Mehta himself sometimes ascribes it to the fact that he wa a member of the Persian “ Parsi ” minority in his own country , although , he always add : “ The Parsis have never experienced racism like the Jews . ” In the heady day that followed the Six Day War – day that saw the marriage of Barenboim and du Pré in Jerusalem – Mehta alternated with Bernstein in conducting the IPO in a series of victory concert . The opening of the 1968-69 season coincided with the announcement of Mehta ’ s appointment a musical director of the IPO , an appointment extended for life in 1981 . “ I will stay for a long a the player want me , ” declared maestro Mehta , in accepting the honor.It wa under his directorship that the IPO achieved acknowledged world-class status . He melded the rich string sound that come so naturally to European musician with the special quality of brass and woodwind that flourish in the United States . Mehta provided the inspired leadership that united a body of musician into a musical instrument that is greater than it part . Above all , he cherished and fostered the unique relationship that ha existed from the first between the orchestra and the people of Israel . Under the Indian Mehta ’ s baton , the IPO wa transformed into the musical expression of the Israeli nation ’ s very identity . ",76 year of the israel philharmonic orchestra

2024-05-04 10:16:04.333,jpost,"Everything about the movie June Zero , which opened in theater throughout Israel on May 2 , is unusual.This includes the fact that the director and co-writer of this quintessentially Israel movie , which tell several story connected to the building of the oven that wa used to cremate Adolf Eichmann after his execution in 1962 , is an American : Jake Paltrow , and yes , he & rsquo ; s Gwyneth & rsquo ; s brother.Paltrow ha made several previous film , including the excellent 2007 The Good Night , about a man who want to achieve in his dream what he couldn & rsquo ; t accomplish while awake , starring Gwyneth Paltrow , Penelope Cruz , Danny DeVito , and Martin Freeman.Paltrow , whose late father , the director , Bruce Paltrow , wa Jewish , became interested in the story surrounding the Eichmann trial , especially concerning the fate of Eichmann & rsquo ; s body , and began researching them in detail . Deciding that for the sake of authenticity , any movie about this topic would have to be in Hebrew and needed a screenwriter who wa an Israeli native , he brought on director Tom Shoval , who made the movie Youth and Shake Your Cares Away , to collaborate with him on the screenplay.June Zero present three story that are connected thematically and create a vivid portrait of the diversity of life in Israel in the early & rsquo ; 60 . We know that Eichmann , the notorious Nazi commander who wa responsible for implementing the Final Solution and causing the death of million of Jews , wa hanged outside a Ramla prison on June 1 , 1962 . & nbsp ; However , people forget that he spent about two year in Israel , a investigator interrogated him before the trial , during his trial , and in the period of appeal that followed the trial . There wa a great fear on the part of the government & ndash ; a justified fear & ndash ; that a concentration camp survivor might assassinate him a revenge for the murder of their family . Since the vast majority of Holocaust victim were Ashkenazim , only Mizrahi police were allowed to guard Eichmann , and the movie focus on Haim ( Yoav Levi ) , his Moroccan-born main guard . & nbsp ; We hear Eichmann speak and see his foot and other part of his body & ndash ; such a his neck , in a harrowing scene when he is getting his hair cut and Haim worry that the barber will try to slit his throat & ndash ; but he is not a character in the film . Instead , we identify with Haim who faithfully carry out the bizarre task of ensuring that no harm come to one of the most notorious war criminal in history.Other story portrayed in the filmANOTHER STORY feature David ( Noam Ovadia ) , a mischievous 13-year-old immigrant from Libya , who ha been sent to work part-time in a factory run by a gruff owner ( Tzahi Grad ) . This factory is given the assignment to build an oven for cremation , a method of body disposal not used in Israel since both Jewish and Muslim religious law prohibits it use . The idea wa to cremate Eichmann & rsquo ; s body and scatter the ash outside Israel & rsquo ; s territorial water , so there would be no grave that could become a spot where pro-Nazis could make pilgrimage to . For the factory and it staff , it wa a race against time to create this oven that is unlike anything they have ever made before , and they are aided by David & rsquo ; s boldness and by the thoroughness of a survivor ( Ami Smolarchik ) , who struggle with his memories.The third section is set in Poland , a Micha ( Tom Hagy ) , a young Holocaust survivor investigating Eichmann & rsquo ; s crime , revisits the ghetto and other site where he and his family suffered and tell his story to visitor from abroad . There he meet a representative ( Joy Rieger ) of an Israeli delegation and the two engage in debate over how best to commemorate the Holocaust . She is critical of dwelling too long on the detail of what happened , while he feel it is his mission to tell his story to the world , and for all survivor to tell their stories.In a statement released by the producer , Paltrow , who visited Israel many time to research the movie , said that he felt that it wa urgent to tell story from the Holocaust to a younger generation around the world who may not understand what really happened and that he wanted to tell story people had not heard before . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; What distinguishes this film from other Holocaust film is the examination of the subject through the most obvious physical and political consequence of the Holocaust : the State of Israel . Israel is not only a country where Holocaust survivor and their descendant live , but it diversity creates a rare mosaic of culture and origin . The Eichmann trial wa a turning point in the young country & rsquo ; s understanding of the atrocity committed by the Nazis in Europe . & rdquo ; While many film , both documentary and drama , have focused on the dramatic Eichmann trial in Jerusalem , Paltrow chose to start the movie after the end of the trial . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Our film is intended to lay the foundation for understanding the complexity of Israel , from the aftermath of the Holocaust to today . This is not the story of the survival of a people in crisis , it is the story of the identity crisis of a people after survival . And throughout it there is also laughter , there is happiness , there is sadness and tear , conflict and drama , & rdquo ; he said.Tom Shoval spoke warmly and appreciatively about collaborating with Paltrow on the screenplay . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Jake got interested in everything connected to the Eichmann trial , it wa a way for him to connect to his Jewish root and identity , it & rsquo ; s something he & rsquo ; s spoken about a lot . & rdquo ; Paltrow became very interested in Israel in the early & rsquo ; 60 , Shoval said , and after he read an article about the building of the oven , he knew it would be the centerpiece of the film.PALTROW WAS visiting Israel to work on pre-production for the film when the COVID pandemic broke out , and he wa stuck in Israel for a few week . He and Shoval used the time to fine-tune the script . Paltrow even filed paperwork to emigrate to Israel so that he could stay in the country to keep working . & ldquo ; It wa a long journey , filled with unexpected turn , & rdquo ; said Shoval . At first , they had planned the movie to be mainly about the building of the oven , but then they realized it needed to be a & ldquo ; panorama of Israeli story of this period . This interested u and we found so many fascinating story , we knew we needed to include them . & rdquo ; The decision to move outside of Israel and back to Poland to tell Micha & rsquo ; s story wa also important in their writing process . & ldquo ; The movie is about memory and history , about what it is to bear witness to the past . . . Before the Eichmann trial , it wasn & rsquo ; t acceptable for Holocaust survivor to tell their story in public in Israel . . . and it wa at this moment when the survivor received a kind of validation of their experience . It wa a turning point and we wanted to show a character who experience this a part of the film . & rdquo ; The wealth of story they discovered & ldquo ; made it possible for u to present a varied wide-ranging portrait of Israel , to show the Ashkenazim and the Mizrahim , the secular and religious , the Jews and the Arabs , the survivor and those who weren & rsquo ; t in the Holocaust , and how it all came together in this story . . . & rdquo ; said Shoval . & ldquo ; It & rsquo ; s a story that hasn & rsquo ; t been told before , and it wa important to u to tell it . & rdquo ;",' june zero ' : an obscure story about eichmann in israel after the trial

2021-05-20 20:49:14.703,jpost,"& nbsp ; Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told US and European Union official this week that he is ready to return to the negotiating table with Israel under the umbrella of the Quartet , which , in addition to the Americans and Europeans , also consists of Russia and the United Nations . & nbsp ; On Wednesday , Abbas repeated his readiness to resume the stalled peace process with Israel during a speech before the Arab Parliament , the legislative body of the Arab League . & nbsp ; Abbas & rsquo ; s talk about reviving the peace process came amid the war that erupted last week between Israel and Hamas . Abbas & rsquo ; s remark came in the context of his effort to show the Americans and Europeans that he is a relevant a ever and that they should look forward to working with him , especially regarding any future peace process with Israel . & nbsp ; Abbas , in other word , wa sending a message to everyone , including the Palestinians and Arabs , that he remains the one and only address for any arrangement or agreement concerning the Palestinians and the conflict with Israel . He felt the need to send this message a his rival in Hamas were negotiating with UN , Egyptian , Qatari , Turkish and other official around the world way of reaching a ceasefire with Israel . & nbsp ; THE 85-YEAR-OLD Abbas ha always been known a someone who like to be the center of attention . He enjoys making a drama out of anything that upset him . He also seems to relish the thought of keeping everyone in suspense regarding his future move , just a he did when he announced & ndash ; and later delayed & ndash ; the Palestinian parliamentary and presidential election , which were supposed to take place on May 22 and July 31 , respectively . & nbsp ; Abbas & rsquo ; s decision in late April to postpone the election put the spotlight on him again , even though he received a lot of negative coverage in the Arab and Western medium for using Jerusalem a a pretext to call off the vote . But in this case , Abbas seems to be going along with the famous quote : & ldquo ; I don & rsquo ; t care what the newspaper say about me a long a they spell my name right . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Abbas , however , did not foresee the consequence of his decision to delay the election and blame Israel for hindering the vote . His accusation against Israel , particularly surrounding the controversy over the participation of Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Arab resident in the Palestinian election , are seen by Palestinian political analyst a one of the factor that contributed to the eruption of violence in the city . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The president did not expect that his statement would add fuel to the fire , & rdquo ; said political analyst Ghassan Abu Omar . & ldquo ; Worse , he did not expect the demonstration , which began in Jerusalem and later spread to the West Bank , to turn into pro-Hamas rally . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Indeed , Hamas wa successful in it effort to take advantage of the violence on the street of Jerusalem to further bolster it standing among the Palestinian public . Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip were rubbing their hand with glee a they watched thousand of Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank raise Hamas flag and chant : & ldquo ; We are all the men of [ Hamas military wing commander ] Mohammed Deif ! & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Buoyed by these scene , Hamas decided to take the risk of firing rocket at Jerusalem during the Jerusalem Day celebration a part of the Gaza-based terrorist group & rsquo ; s effort to present itself a the & ldquo ; defender & rdquo ; of the city and al-Aqsa Mosque . Apparently , Hamas wa expecting a limited response from Israel , one that would perhaps lead to only a few hour of fighting . & nbsp ; The rocket that Hamas launched at Jerusalem were directed not only against Israel , but against Abbas , too . The rocket were meant to show the Palestinian public , a well a all Arabs and Muslims , that while Hamas wa prepared to attack Israel to & ldquo ; deter & rdquo ; it from evicting Arab family from the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah , Abbas wa doing nothing to stop the Israeli & ldquo ; aggression . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; The Hamas attack on Israel made Abbas look very bad , & rdquo ; remarked a veteran Palestinian journalist from Nablus . & ldquo ; In the eye of the Palestinian people , Hamas became the hero , while Abbas wa continuing to conduct security coordination with Israel , making him appear a a traitor . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; To avoid a damaging loss of face , Abbas and his ruling Fatah faction leader joined call for a & ldquo ; day of rage & rdquo ; earlier this week in protest of Israel & rsquo ; s military strike on the Gaza Strip . Senior Fatah leader such a Mahmoud al-Aloul were even sent to participate in demonstration against Israel in some part of the West Bank . Fatah activist in Ramallah and other Palestinian city tried to turn the protest into pro-Abbas rally , but to no avail . & nbsp ; Moreover , masked gunman belonging to Fatah & rsquo ; s military wing , al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , appeared on the street of some Palestinian city in the West Bank to issue threat against Israel . This move wa part of a desperate effort by the Fatah leadership to counter the numerous appearance of masked commander and spokesman of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad during the past week . It wa Fatah & rsquo ; s way of telling the Palestinian public that the faction ha not abandoned the armed struggle against Israel . & nbsp ; In his speech before the Arab Parliament on Wednesday , Abbas said that he wa still working to set a new date for the parliamentary and presidential election . He is also reported to have relayed the same message to US envoy Hady Amr and EU official with whom he met during the past week . & nbsp ; If true , this message prof that Abbas ha completely lost touch with reality . Any election that are held under the current circumstance would be disastrous for Abbas & rsquo ; s Fatah , given Hamas & rsquo ; s rising popularity among the Palestinians in the aftermath of the latest round of fighting with Israel . & nbsp ; Hamas leader are already claiming & ldquo ; victory & rdquo ; for firing thousand of rocket and missile into Israel and forcing million of Israelis into bomb shelter . & nbsp ; They are also taking credit for damaging relation between Jews and Arabs inside Israel and allegedly forcing Israel to & ldquo ; scale down & rdquo ; it measure in Jerusalem , including the suspension of visit by Jews to the Temple Mount , the removal of security barrier at the Old City & rsquo ; s Damascus Gate and the postponement of a court decision to evict the Arab family from their home in Sheikh Jarrah . & nbsp ; These & ldquo ; achievement & rdquo ; will be added to the fact that , a in previous round of hostility , the latest fighting did not end Hamas & rsquo ; s rule over the Gaza Strip . Hamas may have suffered severe blow due to the loss of some of it senior military commander and the massive destruction of it military facility and terrorist infrastructure , but a long a it retains it control over the Gaza Strip , that & rsquo ; s seen by it leader and many Palestinians a a & ldquo ; victory . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; This , in addition to the fact that Hamas once again succeeded in proving that despite the continued Israeli and Egyptian blockade on the Gaza Strip , it ha managed to amass large amount of rocket and missile . & nbsp ; Needless to say , any & ldquo ; victory & rdquo ; for Hamas is bad news for Abbas and Fatah . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; First , Abbas lost much credibility when he delayed the election , & rdquo ; explained Palestinian academic Marwan Abu Sbeih . & ldquo ; The Gaza war drove the final nail in his coffin . No one seems to take him seriously , not even the Arab leader . Not a single Arab head of state called President Abbas during the war to talk about the situation . The only people who were talking to him were the Americans and Europeans , who still believe that he is relevant . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; IN THE coming day and week , Abbas is likely to increase his effort to return to center stage in order to show his people and the rest of the world that he remains a major player in the Palestinian arena . But the event of the past few month have shown that he ha even lost control over his own Fatah faction , which wa planning to run in the parliamentary election on three separate list . The split in Fatah and the fear of a Hamas electoral victory are believed to be the main reason behind Abbas & rsquo ; s decision to delay the vote . & nbsp ; Even if the US and the EU manage to revive the peace process between the Palestinians and Israel , it & rsquo ; s hard to see how Abbas would be able to return to the negotiating table amid the fragmentation in Fatah and the soaring popularity of Hamas.As a former Fatah official in Ramallah commented this week , & ldquo ; If the Palestinians and Arabs no longer take this man seriously , why should anyone else , including the Israelis , Americans and Europeans , take him seriously ? & nbsp ; & ldquo ; This man [ Abbas ] ha divided Fatah , alienated many Palestinians and consolidated the division between the West Bank and Gaza Strip .

As the global community gear up to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day , Yad Vashem & ndash ; Israel & rsquo ; s revered memorial to the victim of the Holocaust & ndash ; stand a a poignant reminder of the peril of forgetting the lesson of the past.Scheduled for Sunday evening , May 5 , the solemn State Opening Ceremony at Yad Vashem & rsquo ; s Warsaw Ghetto Square hold a particular resonance . The Oct . 7 massacre , where Jews living in southern Israel were brutally attacked and murdered by genocide-driven terrorist , felt unfathomably familiar . These event rang a familiar , unnerving tone : of the presence of unwavering hate and the dire consequence that await if we choose to ignore the history of event that led up to the persecution of Jews and the Holocaust.Eclipsed only by the global trend of antisemitism , these occurrence give u cause for renewed worry and angst . College and university campus , meant to be incubator of enlightenment and leadership , are once again being used a hotbed for hatred and extremism . This begs the question : If our future leader are being influenced , what kind of future is in store for Diaspora Jewry ? The theme of Holocaust Remembrance Day 2024It is therefore very appropriate that at the heart of this year & rsquo ; s Holocaust Remembrance Day is the theme & ldquo ; A Lost World : The Destruction of the Jewish Communities . & rdquo ; A profound acknowledgment of the devastation wrought upon the fabric of Jewish life by the effect of unchecked antisemitism . The Jewish community , a unique and autonomous social unit that characterized Jewish existence in the Diaspora for century , wa dealt a fatal blow that devastated the life and community of thousand of pre-war Jews , many of which had formed the very bedrock of Jewish existence.The rise of the Nazi Party and the establishment of German hegemony over Europe plunged Jewish community into a reality of persecution and terror . The establishment of ghetto only served to further isolate entire community , forcing these leader to enforce Nazi decree and assume duty formerly entrusted to governmental body . Finally , the ultimate campaign , the systematic extermination of Jews in Europe and North Africa , inflicted utter devastation upon thousand of community , leaving behind a landscape of destruction and loss.While the Oct . 7 massacre dealt a blow to our nation & rsquo ; s sense of security and serenity , the cruelty inflicted upon the Israeli-Jewish population did not mark another Holocaust . This nuanced reflection honor the individual life of each tragedy.Remembrance and education lie at the heart of a remedy for this disease known a antisemitism . That is why the annual memorial ceremony broadcast across the world in five language including Arabic is so critical . The symbolic Memorial Torch , to be lit this year by Holocaust survivor and Chairman of the Yad Vashem Council Rabbi Israel Meir Lau & ndash ; someone who epitomizes triumph of the human spirit over adversity & ndash ; must transcend into reality if we have any hope of fighting the scourge of antisemitism.Additionally , the story of the six torch lighter & ndash ; Pninah Hefer , Allegra Gutta , Arie Eitani , Raisa Brodsky , Michael Bar-On , and Izi Kabilio & ndash ; only serve to make the enormity of the atrocity more personal.Yad Vashem & rsquo ; s commitment to commemoration extends beyond the confines of mere ceremonial remembrance . For the second year now , it partnership with the Our 6 Million organization seek to personalize remembrance by allowing individual to pay homage to specific victim by lighting a memorial candle bearing the name of the murdered victims.Moreover , Yad Vashem , the World Holocaust Remembrance Center , ha launched an innovative initiative aimed at engaging individual from diverse background to raise public awareness about the Holocaust . The Who Is Your Holocaust Hero ? campaign invite international leader , influencers , diplomat , and actor to personally connect with the Holocaust by sharing the story of an individual who serf a their Holocaust Hero . Participants are asked to record a short video clip , one to two minute long , and share it on their social medium platforms.As the world pause to remember the six million Jewish victim of the Holocaust , Yad Vashem reaffirms it commitment to preserving their memory and educating future generation about the importance of remembrance and tolerance.Through solemn ceremony , innovative initiative , and ongoing campaign , Yad Vashem honor the legacy of those who perished , ensuring that their story endure a a beacon of hope and resilience for generation to come . ■",holocaust remembrance day : observing with renewed urgency post-oct . 7

The Lebanese al-Akhbar newspaper reported that Lebanese official were informed that Israel is interested in entering talk concerning demarcating the land border between the two country and that Hochstein may visit Beirut soon .",nasrallah warns hezbollah will respond if tent are attacked
2023-10-18 20:58:15.947,jpost,"On US President Joe Biden & rsquo ; s flight to Tel Aviv on Wednesday , National Security spokesperson John Kirby said Biden would be asking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & ldquo ; some tough question . & rdquo ; Among those tough question were certainly one about what Israel would do to prevent a many civilian casualty a possible inside Gaza , what Israel would do to prevent a humanitarian crisis , and how Jerusalem planned to respond to Hezbollah provocation in the north.And one of those tough question wa surely a simple one : what is the endgame ? What is Israel & rsquo ; s plan and vision for the Gaza Strip the day after ? Israel clearly stated the goal of this war : to destroy Hamas and remove it control over Gaza . But what happens the day after ? Then what ? Amid the horror , shock , and fury that ha gripped this country since October 7 , there ha been little public discussion inside Israel of this issue and the future of the Gaza Strip.From an Israeli point of view , this is entirely understandable . With the blood still boiling from the horrific Simchat Torah massacre , the country & rsquo ; s focus is simply on uprooting Hamas , on delivering the terrorist organization a mortal blow . & nbsp ; Everything else can wait , including apportioning blame and responsibility for the catastrophe and thinking about what come next.But for Washington , a & ldquo ; we-will-deal-with-this-later & rdquo ; attitude is not enough , and for Biden to be able to sell continued support for Israel to his party and his country , he obviously want to know what policy he is supporting and what Israel want to do after Hamas is expelled.Hamas : Short-term v long-term goalsDelivering a devastating blow to Hamas and removing them from power in Gaza are short-term goal . But what is the long-term goal ? This is important to define because some will only support short-term goal if they know the long-term plan.And this place Israel in a dilemma because it ha never articulated any long-term plan for Gaza.Before October 7 , Israel & rsquo ; s policy toward Gaza could be summed up a containing terrorism until Hamas either realizes that it is not in their interest to pursue terror or something big happens and it is driven from power.Well , now something big ha happened , and Israel is determined to drive Hamas from power . Biden came here partly to hear from Israel what come next.On the face of it , the option are rather limited.The first option is that Israel re-occupies Gaza - - either the whole area or part of it - - and remains there indefinitely.The logic behind this is that the only way to ensure that , once kicked out , Hamas doe not return is for Israel to be in control.While two week ago this idea would have been dismissed a the ranting of the far-right , the Simchat Torah atrocity have brought discussion of that into the mainstream . Even though President Isaac Herzog ha said publicly that Israel ha no intention of doing this , the idea is out there.In a 60-minute interview on Sunday , Biden related to this and said that , in his estimation , such a move would be a & ldquo ; big mistake . & rdquo ; He certainly made that position clear in his meeting here on Wednesday.After dismantling Hamas , a second option is for Israel to hand control of it and it more than two million resident to the Palestinian Authority.The problem with this option is that the Palestinian Authority , both weak and highly unpopular among Palestinians , can barely control the area in the West Bank currently under it control , let alone take on a much bigger project . & nbsp ; In this scenario , handing Gaza over to the PA , which the Palestinian Authority lost control of in 2007 in a bloody coup , would likely necessitate Israel retaining the right to enter the Gaza Strip , a it doe currently in Palestinian town in the West Bank , for security reasons.A third option would be for Egypt to take control of the area , something Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ha made abundantly clear he ha no interest in doing.And another option would be for Gaza to come under the administration of some kind of international consortium , perhaps an international peacekeeping team or a group of state from the Organization of Islamic Conference.This option , too , is considered unrealistic . First , few country are biting at the bit to take on this chore . Second , Israel & rsquo ; s experience with international peacekeeper keeping terrorist group out of territory ha not been good , a evidenced by the situation in southern Lebanon , where peacekeeper have been unable to keep Hezbollah from taking control and threatening Israel.In addition , inviting international actor into an area where Israel might continuously need to engage militarily is only inviting trouble.Since none of those possibility are particularly attractive , developing other , perhaps more creative idea is needed to present a an endgame.Having an endgame is essential not only to answer Biden & rsquo ; s question but also for other reason , including to help Israel & rsquo ; s public diplomacy effort a the war grind on and the focus , a is already the case , move from the October 7 massacre to the devastation in Gaza.Israeli spokespeople interviewed about the situation have so far been able to deflect question about an endgame by saying & ldquo ; first thing first , & rdquo ; first let the country defeat Hamas , and then Israel will deal with the future of Gaza . & nbsp ; But the country & rsquo ; s public diplomacy effort would be helped if the spokespeople said , & ldquo ; We are destroying Hamas today , and this is what we want to see happen tomorrow . & rdquo ; In the need for an endgame , Israel should learn from the experience of the 1967 Six-Day War . Israel won that war , but never succeeded in clearly defining what it hoped to see down the line . It never defined clearly , and still ha not defined clearly , what it endgame wa for Judea and Samaria . And it suffered from that lack of clarity.As the Palestinians demanded a complete return to the 1967 line , Israel always said what it wanted depended on what the Arabs said , what the Americans wanted , and what the Palestinians would agree to . But Israel never stated clearly what it wanted to do with the territory . It always depends , but depends is not policy . One can not achieve what one doe not define.Israel already need to define what it want to see happen in Gaza when the war end and Hamas is destroyed . Only then , maybe , will this be achievable .",israel already need a plan for the day after it topples hamas - analysis

2023-02-18 15:42:53.083,jpost,"Tensions are elevated in Jerusalem amid several devastating terrorist attack in the city over the past month . & nbsp ; The first , on a Shabbat evening in the Neveh Ya & rsquo ; acov neighborhood , left seven Israelis dead a they departed synagogue to go home to their meal . The next day , a 13-year-old Palestinian opened fire on Jewish worshiper in the City of David , leaving two civilian wounded . Shortly before sundown on Friday last week , a terrorist rammed his vehicle into Israelis at a bus stop , killing three & ndash ; including two brother aged six and eight . And there were two stabbing attack this past week , one by a 14-year-old.This is alongside record number of Palestinians being killed by IDF force in the West Bank during ensuing raid and arrest , leading to a general feeling of unease by everyone in the holy city . The Magazine spoke with a range of individual in the capital to find out how they feel , what they are doing differently , and where they see thing going.What did Israelis think about the violence in Jerusalem ? Views were diverse , depending on where they stood in the spectrum & ndash ; whether native-born Israeli , immigrant , secular or religious . For example , Samantha Levy , an activist who moved to Israel nine year ago , said that & ldquo ; the circumstance in Jerusalem lead me to seek out training in self-defense and how to handle security threat . & rdquo ; For native Israelis or those who have lived in the country for a long time , recent event have rekindled horrid memory from the day of the Second Intifada in the early 2000s . Noam Elia , an Israeli-American who grew up in Jerusalem and returned six month ago after living in New York for a decade , said that the situation is not like then , when bus were blowing up nearly every week . He added , however , that thing are moving in a dangerous direction . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; I remember during the Second Intifada riding my scooter up Agrippas Street and wa about to turn into the Nahalot neighborhood when I saw a police officer at the end of the street . I decided not to turn , and a few second later a huge explosion went off . It is scary . & rdquo ; Noam Elia & ldquo ; I remember during the Second Intifada riding my scooter up Agrippas Street and wa about to turn into the Nahalot neighborhood when I saw a police officer at the end of the street . I decided not to turn , and a few second later a huge explosion went off . It is scary . & rdquo ; Although bomb are not going off today , & ldquo ; you have to keep an eye out for suspicious people or activity . Jerusalem is the center of all of this . & rdquo ; Emanuel , a tech entrepreneur , recalled what it wa like to grow up in Jerusalem . & ldquo ; You are exposed to persistent conflict from a young age . I remember being in school in the heart of the city , and you could hear the sound of attack while sitting in class . & ldquo ; The constant state of alertness , whether at bus stop or while taking public transportation , ha become a way of life for me . Despite this , I have not let it sway my choice of making Jerusalem my home . & rdquo ; Another resident , Isabella Swart , said there is a sense of anxiety in the air but that & ldquo ; Israel is a super-resilient country . We are not afraid because we are in our land with our people . & rdquo ; She continued with a suggestion to add cement barrier on sidewalk to prevent ramming . & nbsp ; Elya Cowland of Ramot , where the two child were killed last week , spoke somberly about an attack that wa close to home . & ldquo ; Despite not knowing the victim , I feel a heightened sense of tragedy and loss . When terror struck my neighborhood , the numbness I usually feel regarding these attack shattered . I saw with complete clarity the heinousness and horrific nature of the event . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Despite not knowing the victim , I feel a heightened sense of tragedy and loss . When terror struck my neighborhood , the numbness I usually feel regarding these attack shattered . I saw with complete clarity the heinousness and horrific nature of the event . & rdquo ; Elya CowlandRabbi Yehoshua Pfeffer of Ramot also spoke about the attack a he wa headed to the shiva for the victim , pointing out two way to view the situation . & ldquo ; On the one hand , this is a human tragedy & ndash ; and that is perhaps the first reaction , especially with this so close to home . These are bus stop where all our kid are , so you feel a certain sense of insecurity ; you don & rsquo ; t know who is going to be next . The result is a more tense atmosphere . & ldquo ; The religious response is to turn to God in prayer and strengthen element of practice . But there is also the political aspect . For example , people such a [ National Security Minister Itamar ] Ben-Gvir have promised to restore security in face of attack and threat . & ldquo ; He is always first at the scene and garnered support from even haredi and the youth . And yet , ha he done anything ? Is it all talk or will he actually do something that will give u a greater sense of security ? & rdquo ; He pointed out that Ramot is a primarily haredi area . & ldquo ; We don & rsquo ; t consider ourselves settler ; there is no settler consciousness here . This is happening to u , and what is the response from our rabbi and [ haredi ] politician ? Nothing . Just to pray . Of course we need to , but we also need policy . & rdquo ; Pfeffer lamented the imbalance between MKs and rabbi , who & ldquo ; can speak up on religious matter & ndash ; which are important & ndash ; but so are people & rsquo ; s life . If you have the privilege to be in power , you can not sit on the sideline . It is up to [ the politician ] to come up with some type of policy . & rdquo ; ARABS WHO live in east Jerusalem chose to remain anonymous when speaking with the Magazine . One said that he think that & ldquo ; the silent majority of east Jerusalemites don & rsquo ; t like attack on civilian because it hurt them more than it benefit them . However , I think the majority see attack on soldier and police a a win . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Others expressed outrage at the deadly shooting at the Neveh Ya & rsquo ; acov synagogue , saying that & ldquo ; attack on those leaving prayer service is crossing a line . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Yet it is evident that the general mood among Palestinians in east Jerusalem and the West Bank is reaching a boiling point . This is especially true in east Jerusalem . Arabs there are under complete Israeli sovereignty , yet lack the same service that are available to Israelis . This includes issue surrounding passport and visa & ndash ; flash point , a they desire the freedom to travel and work abroad . The reality is bleaker in West Bank city such a Nablus or Jenin , where many attacker come from.What happens going forward ? Policymakers are assessing how the terror attack will impact tourism and , in turn , the economy . Upward of four million people on average visit Jerusalem annually , with tourism a vital economic lifeline . Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Fleur Hassan-Nahoum , whose portfolio includes tourism , told the Magazine that & ldquo ; the recent terrorist attack have shaken our whole nation and left u in mourning . I understand the fear and concern among our resident and tourist alike , but Jerusalem is a city of strength and resilience . & ldquo ; It ha faced and overcome many challenge in the past , and these act of terror will not define it . & rdquo ; She continued that & ldquo ; necessary measure have been taken to ensure safety and security . I am confident that Jerusalem will continue to thrive and attract visitor from around the world . & rdquo ; HOW TO respond on an individual level is a question on the mind of many . Ben-Gvir ha pushed for expediting gun license for civilian , pointing to the fact that many terrorist are stopped quickly by armed Israelis . Those interviewed echoed this sentiment , expressing a desire to obtain a license and purchase a gun . Some are even carrying deterrent such a pepper spray or knives.Elia said he ha purchased pepper spray for himself and his family ; others said they keep an eye out for potentially dangerous situation . & nbsp ; Arguably , the most frightening reality about the current attack is just how unpredictable they can be . Unlike in the past , when attack were often carried out by centralized terror group , today & rsquo ; s terrorist may have no prior history of criminal behavior , yet find themselves so radicalized that they take up arm . & nbsp ; These type of & ldquo ; lone wolf & rdquo ; terrorist have sprung up across the world and are also a challenge for Israel & rsquo ; s police force . Though there is a common profile of these attacker & ndash ; single and unemployed & ndash ; the provocative rhetoric in the mosque and the proliferation of hateful messaging on social medium are also inciting brutal attack on civilian , young and old.WHERE THIS is leading to is anyone & rsquo ; s guess . Will it spiral into an all-out third intifada a some predict ? Though many hope not , the possibility is nevertheless being discussed . Even the smallest of perceived provocation , such a Ariel Sharon & rsquo ; s 2000 visit to the Temple Mount , can spiral out of control and be the catalyst of wide-scale disturbances.Levy pointed out that the lack of action or change in the political realm ensures that the status quo of terror will continue . & ldquo ; Our political figure have not been pursuing the change that we need . & rdquo ; As a result , & ldquo ; it make no sense that child should have to be killed by a ramming at a bus stop before Shabbat or that older people should be killed a they exit a synagogue after prayer . & rdquo ; Elia belief politician like Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich are aiming for escalation , a & ldquo ; it can help reach a determination in the conflict . & rdquo ; In any case , it is clear from these discussion that despite the uptick in violence , no one is making plan to leave the country . This is their home , nowhere else . With that in mind , no amount of attack can stop people from continuing to move to the capital and start family . ",what do jerusalemites think about security on the street ?

In general , upon arrival it assesses the situation and us precision tactic and special tactic to neutralize terrorist . & ldquo ; I have to be certain about every shot that I take and be responsible for every bullet that come out of my rifle , & rdquo ; said Ran.The team is supposed to be an QRF ( quick reaction force ) , along with other elite unit such a Shaldag , Duvdevan , and Seyeret Metkal . On Saturday , it had to deal with a massive terrorist wave swamping the entire border and threatening 20 community and some 60,000 people.The QRF always ha a unit on standby that can proceed to a scene . By 7:30 a.m . , the first unit had arrived in Sderot . This wa a four-man team , and it wa confronting a situation where , according to some estimate , 250 terrorist had tried to infiltrate the city . & ldquo ; As the first team went to Sderot , my team member and I went to the unit and began mobilizing the team [ to operate ] alongside the Gaza Strip , from south to north , to see how we could create some safety net around the Strip in order to push and make it more organized when the entire military arrives and join the fight , & rdquo ; Boorstein explained.As he proceeded to join his unit , he said , all the reservist had received the gear that they needed . This wa in contrast to some report of reservist showing up and saying they lacked some important item . & ldquo ; Every soldier who came got a weapon and helmet and everything needed , including water , food , and ammunition . We have it all . & rdquo ; Meanwhile , Bergman & rsquo ; s Kfir unit had retaken Re & rsquo ; im . & nbsp ; There had been some 40 terrorist there , and they were neutralized . The unit killed 10 of them . Then they began to assist in the rescue of people . In one home , people were hiding in a shelter , and terrorist were in the house.The unit came to the door and managed to throw grenade , killing the terrorist and rescue those hiding.TWO TERRORIST body were found . It took two day to secure the entire area.Then the unit went to Kibbutz Be & rsquo ; eri , where there had been a massacre and more than 100 body were found . This wa a difficult battle.Now Bergman ha been sent to the North , and another unit had replaced theirs.For Ran and the QRF , the battle had just begun . & nbsp ; The Lotar went street by street in Sderot , clearing the city of terrorist . They killed at least 15 among the enemy . They said terrorist were operating in many place , and the initial chaos meant that the enemy seemed to be everywhere . One member of the Lotar wa killed in Sderot ; another wa wounded . The team of 12 , bolstered by other member who had just arrived , wa then led by the sergeant , who took over for the wounded commander . & ldquo ; By 8:30 to 9 a.m . , a lot of special force unit were joining u to create this safety net in Sderot , and they continued the fighting , & rdquo ; Ran recounted.The unit wa also involved in retaking and securing the military base near Nahal Oz , where , Ran estimated , there were 150 IDF casualty . Some were killed and burned alive , he said . & ldquo ; You can imagine what they did to the body , and the amount of thing I & rsquo ; ve seen , it & rsquo ; s not even close to what a human being is . I can & rsquo ; t imagine what drive them to do such thing . . . We saved a many soldier a we could ; some were trapped and hiding alongside the outpost . & rdquo ; After securing the area , they moved along the security fence to an IDF outpost called Taga.There , they found a scene from a horror movie . It wa quiet , silent even . Yet the war wa raging along the border . The Golani brigade wa supposed to be in Taga.The counterterrorism force had 28 member by this time , including some from Oketz , the unit that operates with specially trained dog . Ran praised one of the dog for saving life in the battle.As they moved through the outpost , which seemed abandoned , suddenly they saw two shape in the distance . It could be a hostage situation , they feared . But it turned out to be two terrorist , and the Israeli fighter shot them . It took about 30 minute to clear the area , and they saved five Golani soldier who were sheltering . & ldquo ; We scanned another site nearby that belongs to another Israeli security service of Israel . & rdquo ; When the area wa secure , they moved on to another mission and drove to Nir Yitzhak , a kibbutz . & ldquo ; It wa Saturday night . We were guarding around the kibbutz and making sure no terrorist were infiltrating the kibbutz line . By now , reserve team were mobilized to Be & rsquo ; eri . There wa a whole massacre there of 100 to 200 civilian ; none of them were armed , & rdquo ; he said.He then joined IDF unit from Shayetet , Shaldag , Yamam and others to retake the area . It took 18 hour of fighting . Then they helped evacuate people from Kissufim , Nir Yitzhak , Sufa , Kerem Shalom , and other places.ON OCTOBER 7 , the QRF faced an unbelievable challenge never seen before in Israel . With 20 location under attack and approximately six unit trained for these kind of situation , they had to prioritize where to go first . For instance , Shaldag and Seyeret Matkal went to Sderot . Others went to Be & rsquo ; eri and Ofakim.Many area were left for the local to defend , a they had to wait for the army to arrive . That wa the case in Erez . Cohen and his small team from the two community were able to save the kibbutz from slaughter by laying down fire and keeping the enemy away from the community & rsquo ; s entrance . However , they felt surrounded for many hour and knew there were enemy sniper nearby . & ldquo ; From 7 to 11 a.m . , no one came to support u , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; We didn & rsquo ; t know what wa happening . We wondered & lsquo ; Where is the army ? & rsquo ; Then we understood that there wa a large attack . & rdquo ; They felt alone . The enemy brought up an RPG ( rocket-propelled grenade ) and fired at them . It hit a house , but luckily the family inside survived . They heard the sound of tank in the distance but didn & rsquo ; t know what wa happening . At Or HaNer , there wa concern that terrorist could strike . Cohen faced the difficult choice of whether to send two member of the team back to his community or to keep them in Erez . They stayed in Erez . There wa a buzzing , perhaps a helicopter in the distance . But the din of shooting meant it wa hard to know.Eventually , the army arrived at 11 a.m . and rescued the security team . An entire community wa saved.Others had been massacred.Cohen wa then called up to his unit and began serving near his community . & ldquo ; The casualty we had wa the member of the Konenut who died , and two wounded that we managed to rescue from the terrorist , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo ; We had a very complex situation . & rdquo ; He emphasized it is important to understand that in the most recent day of the war , his battalion experienced success . & ldquo ; We are approaching victory . We are a strong nation with a strong army . & rdquo ; BOORSTEIN & rdquo ; S UNIT defended community around Gaza during the fighting on Saturday and in the day after . He ha a long record of experience in these type of battle , having served in the 2006 Lebanon War and in this year & rsquo ; s Operation Break the Wave and Operation Shield and Arrow . Despite the initial setback on Saturday and the massacre of civilian , he stressed that Israel will win this war . & ldquo ; We will rebuild & ndash ; here and everywhere in Israel , & rdquo ; he said , adding that all of Israel saw the hellish story that unfolded on Shabbat . Everyone watched the news and saw & ldquo ; very difficult image . & rdquo ; & ldquo ; But despite how hard it is , we will win and change and become a stronger society a Israel know how to do . & rdquo ; ",how the idf retook the gaza border from hamas terrorist

2023-11-23 08:56:38.440,jpost,"The IDF and the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) around 2:30 p.m . Thursday afternoon finally admitted to having arrested the director of Shifa Hospital , which ha been at the center of medium narrative battle between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.First , report in the Palestinian and Hebrew medium about his arrest surfaced already much earlier Thursday morning.Questioned repeatedly earlier in the morning about why he had been arrested and why no official announcement had gone out , Israeli and IDF official ' response alternated from surprise at the event to a promise that an announcement would go out soon.However , even the 2:30 p.m . announcement did not make any direct charge against the Shifa chief.Rather , the announcement said that he had been arrested and brought to the Shin Bet for interrogation after significant testimony and video evidence from others that Shifa had been used a a command center for Hamas during the director 's tenure.The statement stated , `` the terror group Hamas utilized many resource , including electricity in order to strengthen it tunnel which it built under the hospital . In addition , Hamas kept military item stored in the hospital and in it immediate surroundings . `` In addition , the statement read that after the October 7 Hamas mass terror attack on Israel 's South , the terror group `` used the hospital a a refuge for it terror force and even brought Israeli hostage to there who were kidnapped during the day of slaughter . A pathology report confirmed that soldier Noa Marciano wa murdered on the ground of Shifa Hospital . `` Next , the statement said vaguely that , `` a decision regarding his detention would be made in conjunction with the finding of the investigation regarding his involvement with the hospital 's connection to terror . `` There are a number of possible scenario about how this could play out.If Israel ha direct Palestinian witness testimony or videographic evidence to incriminate the director , he could actually be brought to trial before special civilian court or Israeli military court on those charge and could be potentially sentenced to prison time in Israel.Alternatively , Israel may not have such direct incriminating evidence , and it evidence may be more ambiguous , such a the idea that it would be impossible for any reasonable director to be completely oblivious to the sheer volume of us by Hamas of his hospital.In this case , it might still try to mount a case for some kind of easier to prove more minor charge , such a aiding and abetting terrorism without even being a member of a terror group.Yet another possibility is that the Shin Bet hope to scare him into providing them intelligence information to more quickly uncover the remaining aspect of Hamas 's concealed presence at Shifa , in which case if he cooperates , he may be released with no charges.Even if a case is brought against him , he could always defend against any conviction by claiming his life wa under threat and that any passive cooperation he provided to Hamas wa under coercion and duress , or wa for the benefit of his patient , who Hamas might otherwise kill.This could make him difficult to convict.In all scenario , detaining him will be complex globally , a generally democracy do not detain senior medical staff who are not their citizens.Hamas immediately condemned the arrest of the director of the hospital , saying `` We see this move by Israel a nothing less than despicable , lacking any sense of humanity and moral . It is also a flagrant violation of international norm and charter , given obligation to ensure that medical personnel are never harmed , including in time of war . `` `` We call on international body , including the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , with which Dr . Muhammad wa in contact to evacuate the remaining patient and wounded from Al-Shifa Hospital , to exert pressure on the Israeli occupation army to secure his release , along with the medical personnel who were arrested simply for continuing to fulfill their humanitarian duty . `` Since 2014 , top Israeli defense official have repeatedly stated that top Hamas official spent the 2014 Gaza conflict hiding in tunnel under Shifa Hospital and the complex ha since been turned into a massive underground military installation.In recent day , the IDF ha published footage showing room and tunnel found under the hospital , a well a weapon found in the facility.Hostages held in Shifa hospitalSurveillance camera footage retrieved from the hospital showed at least two hostage being brought by armed individual into the hospital on October 7 , including one who wa being dragged by his head through the hospital.IDF R . - Adm . Daniel Hagari also revealed recently that intelligence ha shown that Israeli hostage , Noa Marciano , wa killed in Shifa.The IDF did not comment on report that a small number of other medical staff were arrested.Meanwhile , the IDF worked hard on Thursday to toughen it position across northern Gaza to prevent any surprise attack by Hamas.In 2014 , Hamas violated a number of temporary ceasefires , in some case successfully surprising and killing IDF soldiers.IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi had held a briefing with all major general , brigadier general , and colonel involved in Gaza operation on Wednesday to ensure that they would be ready for anything Hamas might try.The IDF also said that Maj . Gen . ( re . ) Nitzan Alon had set up a special apparatus near the Gaza border for taking in hostage presuming Hamas follows through with the term of the war pause . & nbsp ; That apparatus is highly organized both in term of special medical and psychological staff a well a helicopter and other heavy weaponry to ensure security.Besides those development , due to the war pause being delayed , the IDF continued attack on Hamas on Thursday in Jabalia and Zeitoun , northeast area which it only turned it attention to late last week after having already taken over central Gaza City.The IDF said it had found more weapon hidden in child 's bed , mosaues , and other civilian location , a it had previously in other part of Gaza.If the war pause end in the next 4-10 day , the IDF would be expected to spend some day or up to a week finishing with Hamas in Jabalia and Zeitoun a well a taking on Hamas in the tough Shejaiya neighborhood where some of the harshest battle were fought in 2014.The IDF would also need to eventually invade Khan Younis and Rafah , among other Hamas southern stronghold , which could take more time to subdue .",idf arrest director of gaza 's shifa hospital

Guterres ha been a strong advocate of a two-state resolution to the conflict and reaffirmed that stance at the meeting . & ldquo ; The secretary-general reaffirms the UN commitment to supporting the party to achieve a just and peaceful solution to the conflict , including through the Middle East Quartet and the establishment of two state , based on 1967 line , with Jerusalem a the capital of both state , & rdquo ; Dujarric said . This would be & ldquo ; in line with UN resolution , international law and previous agreement , & rdquo ; he said . Friday & rsquo ; s meeting marked the end of a series of high-level conversation among a small group of Israelis and Palestinians last week in Washington and New York . They met with US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and the nominee for assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs , Barbara Leaf , a well a number of Democratic member of Congress and the Senate , including Sen . Chris Van Hollen of Maryland . The meeting with Guterres lasted for 40 minute and included four of his adviser , Beilin said . The UN head said the plan could perhaps help revive the peace process , and he expressed regret at the absence of negotiation . Beilin said he had asked Guterres if he would include the confederation plan in his talking point with leader in the region and if he could help the group use the UN platform for debate and discourse on the confederation . & ldquo ; He [ Guterres ] promised that in his talk with his interlocutor , a he said , he will raise this option of a confederation , & rdquo ; Beilin said , adding that separately , & ldquo ; for the first time after many year , [ Guterres said ] he can have a dialogue with the Israeli government . & rdquo ; Brig . - Gen .

When they met with Sherman , she wa particularly interested in the section about settler remaining in their home , given that the issue of evacuating the settlement is one of the most difficult one on the road to peace , Beilin said . Sherman did not endorse the plan , but she said it wa productive and that they had & ldquo ; not given up & rdquo ; and were trying to find a realistic path to peace , he said . The Holy Land Confederation plan proposes a European Union-style confederation of an independent Israeli and Palestinian state based on pre-1967 border a outlined by the 2003 Geneva Initiative . This new plan is not formally connected to the initiative or to the organization that continues to promote it . Beilin wa instrumental in the formation of the 1993 Oslo Accords and the Geneva Initiative , which he ha incorporated into his latest endeavor . Among the distinct feature of the plan is a joint Israeli-Palestinian narrative of the history of both people . The plan also provides a blueprint by which settler would remain in their home a resident but not citizen of a Palestinian state . In exchange , a similar number of Palestinians would be allowed to live in Israel a resident but not citizen . Beilin and Husseini have published their plan at a time when few Israelis and Palestinians are pursuing talk . The formal peace process ha been frozen for almost eight year . Prime Minister Naftali Bennett ha been blunt about his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state , and US President Joe Biden ha not spoken of any intention to put forward a peace process at this time .",guterres lauds effort of israeli-palestinian confederation plan author

2021-02-07 21:22:58.777,jpost,"& nbsp ; Israel & rsquo ; s right to self-defense and to it ancient biblical capital of Jerusalem suffered a blow on Friday when an International Criminal Court ( ICC ) ruling advanced the possibility of war crime suit against Israelis . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; If the International Criminal Court is making a list of so-called Israeli [ war crime ] suspect , I ask that my name be put a the top of that list , & rdquo ; Yamina party head Naftali Bennett said on Sunday . & nbsp ; It wa not just a statement of bravado against the highest international criminal judiciary body . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; As a former defense minister , there is a very real possibility that he could one day be targeted by the court . & nbsp ; For the Palestinians , the ICC ruling offered a ray of hope to hold Israel accountable for alleged human right abuse . & nbsp ; Upon hearing of the ruling , Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh responded by stating that perpetrator of crime will & ldquo ; not go unpunished . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; For many Israelis the idea that the court plan to target them with respect to action in Gaza and Israeli settlement activity , but ha not held human right abuser in Iran , Syria and or China accountable , speaks to the continued bias of international organization against the Jewish state . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; But how real is the possibility of war crime suit ? Who would be targeted and for what ? & nbsp ; & nbsp ; How harmful or helpful wa the ruling to either Israel or the Palestinian Authority , which first turned to the court in 2015 and asked that it adjudicate war crime suit ? & nbsp ; 1 . Is the probe only focused on Israel ? & nbsp ; No . The ICC will examine action by both Israeli and Palestinians , including Hamas . But the probe wa launched at the request of Palestinians and is expected to overwhelmingly focus on activity by Israelis against Palestinians . & nbsp ; 2 . Can all Israeli and or Palestinians action be considered war crime ? & nbsp ; No . The ICC will examine activity that occurred since June 13 , 2014 . The scope of the probe is also limited to only those incident which occurred over the pre-1967 line in east Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza . This includes Jerusalem & rsquo ; s Old City , the Western Wall and the Temple Mount , known to Muslims a al-Haram al-Sharif . Israelis are liable for such action , even though Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute which governs the ICC . The Palestinian Authority , in contrast , signed the statute in 2015 . & nbsp ; 3 . What three main issue will the ICC likely probe ? & nbsp ; The first is the 2014 Gaza war , including the question of disproportionate attack by the IDF and indiscriminate rocket attack by armed Palestinian group in Gaza , including Hamas . & nbsp ; The second is IDF use of lethal force against the Hamas-led & ldquo ; Great March of Return & rdquo ; along the Gaza border , which began in March 2018 and ended in December 2019 . & nbsp ; Third , the ICC would also look at the issue of whether settlement activity in the West Bank and Jewish building in east Jerusalem , since that June 2014 date , could be considered a war crime . Israel & rsquo ; s razing of Palestinian structure could be examined tangentially , but not a the main focus . & nbsp ; Other incident since that date could also be probed in the future , but the main immediate thrust is expected to be these three issue . & nbsp ; 4 . Is the state and or individual Israelis at risk ? & nbsp ; Both . On the policy level , Israel fear that a negative ruling on matter relating to Gaza would ultimately raise question about Israel & rsquo ; s right to self-defense and make it difficult for the IDF to operate against threat to the state and it citizen , particularly on Israel & rsquo ; s southern border . & nbsp ; A negative ruling on settlement and Jewish building in east Jerusalem , Israel fear , would undercut it legal claim to historical and religious right to it ancient Biblical territory and it legal claim to be indigenous to that territory . & nbsp ; If the Palestinians are successful at the ICC , then Israeli activity in both it biblical heartland of Judea and Samaria , otherwise known a the West Bank , and in it ancient capital of Jerusalem , would be a war crime . & nbsp ; The security cabinet mentioned the absurdity of both claim when it issued a statement against the ICC ruling on Sunday . & nbsp ; On the individual level , war crime suit could be leveled against people and not the state . This mean that leader such a Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Moshe Ya & rsquo ; alon , who held that post during the 2014 Gaza War , and Avigdor Liberman , who wa defense minister when the Great March began . Defense Minister Benny Gantz and his predecessor Bennett could also be targeted along with individual soldier and commander . & nbsp ; 5 . What wa Friday & rsquo ; s ruling and why did it matter ? & nbsp ; The ICC & rsquo ; s Pre-Trial Chamber ruled 2-1 that the court & rsquo ; s & nbsp ; Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda had the jurisdiction to open an investigation into potential Israeli and Palestinian war crime on territory over the pre-1967 line in the West Bank , Gaza and east Jerusalem . Jurisdiction wa one of the earliest and most global ground on which the threat of an ICC war crime suit could have been averted both on the issue of Gaza and the settlement , had the three judge ruled against jurisdiction . & nbsp ; Their decision in support of jurisdiction can & rsquo ; t be appealed at this stage . The argument against jurisdiction can only be reopened at a later phase in the process , once individual charge have been filed to the court for approval . & nbsp ; 6 . Did the court & rsquo ; s jurisdictional ruling include recognition of Palestine a a state ? & nbsp ; No . The Pre-Trial Chamber specifically stated that such a move wa outside of it purview , but it said that it could be considered a such solely for the purpose of these issue of adjudicating war crime . & nbsp ; The basis of it ruling strengthened the status of de facto Palestinian statehood and the role of the United Nations in determining that status . The ruling upgraded the significance of the 2012 UN General Assembly Resolution that granted the Palestinians the status of a non-member state by legitimizing the de facto status it granted the PA to have the right of member state to sign UN treaty and statue , including the Rome Statute . It wa that signature which opened the possibility of war crime suit . & nbsp ; The Pre-Trial Chamber also relied on the text of that resolution to set the territory on which it had jurisdiction . It wa a move that upgraded the legal status and impact of such resolution , particularly with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . & nbsp ; 7 . How significant wa the dissenting opinion ? & nbsp ; ICC Judge P & eacute ; ter Kov & aacute ; c disagreed with his two other peer ; Reine Ad & eacute ; la & iuml ; de Sophie Alapini-Gansou and Marc Perrin de Brichambau , a well a with Bensouda herself . He said that Palestine could not be considered a de facto state for the purpose of the tribunal and that the court & rsquo ; s jurisdiction could not be fully extended to Gaza , the West Bank and east Jerusalem . & nbsp ; He took particular issue with the reliance his peer and Bensouda placed on the UNGA & rsquo ; s 2012 resolution , which he said wa non-binding and did not carry the legal weight attributed to it . & nbsp ; In a strongly worded 168-page option , that wa longer than the original 60-page one issued by the Pre-Trial chamber , he brought into evidence statement by PA official themselves a well a the UN , to the effect that Palestine is not yet considered to be a state . & nbsp ; Kov & aacute ; c argument lend legal weight to Israel & rsquo ; s contention that Palestine can not be considered a state . They reflect a lack of legal unanimity on the issue with the court and can be used later to bolster appeal claim . & nbsp ; 8 . What are the next step ? & nbsp ; Bensouda would inform the party and the court that she ha opened an investigation , at which time they would have 30 day to respond . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Among the critical aspect of her investigation is the question of whether the Israelis or the Palestinians have adjudicated or would adjudicate issue with regard to Gaza and the settlement , according to Israel Democracy Institute Vice President of Research and legal expert Prof . Yuval Shany . The ICC is called into play often only in situation where the national court system is non-existent or ha not addressed the pertinent issue , he explained . & nbsp ; It is at this stage that Israeli probe or potential probe into criminal activity by it soldier in Gaza could sway Bensouda not to move forward on war crime allegation with regard to Gaza , Shany said . & nbsp ; Israel ha not simultaneously held criminal investigation into settlement activity & ndash ; which it considers to be legal & ndash ; and thus Bensouda is likely to move the matter of settlement forward to the phase of individual criminal charge . & nbsp ; Those charge against individual either with respect to Gaza or the settlement must be confirmed with the court . It is at that phase that individual charged could appeal , including on jurisdictional ground , Shany said . & nbsp ; The timing of the matter is likely to be crucial , since Bensouda & rsquo ; s term a chief prosecutor is slated to end in June and a new prosecutor will make decision on the case .",eight thing to know about the icc war crime suit against israel

In an exercise held this week in the Gaza Division , the force practiced such scenario , including an infiltration into Israeli territory . The aboveground barrier , made of steel , is about 65 km long and six meter high . It will extend from Zikim Beach to the Kerem Shalom crossing and it purpose is to prevent terrorist from entering Israeli territory from aboveground . The defense establishment belief that Hamas leader understood , a part of the conclusion drawn from Operation Guardian of the Walls , that alongside the attack tunnel , which it people continue to invest in , the organization must develop additional option for operation that it ha used effectively in the past , but abandoned in recent year . The security tension and stalemate in talk with Hamas over an agreement for calm and a prisoner swap agreement , mediated by Egypt , could push the organization to take action against Israel . According to evaluation , a part of operational order for when the order is given , Hamas member are training for raid and infiltration into Israeli territory a well a the use of large explosive vehicle . As mentioned , the defense establishment is aware of the fact that Hamas is investing a lot of effort in digging new defensive and attack tunnel and in rehabilitating the tunnel damaged in the operation . It is estimated that the route of the attack tunnel is approaching the barrier area , although no tunnel out into Israeli territory is known . Israel ha noticed that in recent month Hamas ha been making a major effort to rehabilitate and improve it military capability , a a lesson from the operation in which it men found it difficult to hit IDF soldier and target along the border .

2021-05-14 08:24:26.737,jpost,"Iron Dome always had a weakness . It shot down 85 % - 90 % of Hamas rocket in past round of battle & ndash ; and that wa out of the one which were projected to land in populated area . As long a the volume of rocket Hamas could shoot in a single salvo wa small , this wa almost a hermetic defense . But Israeli intelligence and national security official had long warned that Hezbollah had a sufficient number of rocket to pound the Jewish state with over 1,000 rocket in a day , an amount that could pierce the Iron Dome shield . This wa one reason the IDF ha been so careful when it came to Hezbollah . The terror group ha 150,000 or more rocket , including hundred of advanced one , which mean that 1,000 per day wouldn & rsquo ; t even dent it arsenal . Has Hamas now found it own way to undermine Iron Dome ? During the 2014 Gaza War , Hamas fired almost 4,000 rocket , but that wa spread out over 50 day . It usually fired dozen of rocket in a day at most , and spread them out over the day . Its high wa around 200 rocket spread over a whole day & ndash ; and out of the 50 day of the war , it fired more than 100 rocket per day for only around two week . Also , the vast majority of these rocket were fired at the Gaza corridor since Hamas had a limited number of rocket capable of reaching Tel Aviv and other area .

This is a jump both in the number of rocket being used against Tel Aviv , and in the terrorist group & rsquo ; s ability to fire a high volume of rocket simultaneously . This is an ability that Hezbollah wa known to have , but wa thought to be some time away still for Hamas . DOES THIS mean the Iron Dome is no longer effective ? No . It still intercept the majority of rocket fired at Israeli population center although some are getting through . The bigger question is whether Israeli intelligence estimate are correct that Hamas ha only a few hundred missile which can reach Tel Aviv . If those estimate are accurate , then Hamas may have used up a large chunk of that arsenal , even if it ha thousand more which can hit Beersheba , Ashdod and community near the Gaza border . But if Hamas ha more of those longer-range rocket , this could impact Israel & rsquo ; s plan for this round of violence and especially the question of how long it want it to last . If Hamas can pierce the missile shield with 100 rocket in a few minute twice in one day , how much more damage can Hezbollah and Iran do with the longer , larger and more accurate missile it possesses ? Israeli decision-makers and military strategist will need to take this into account in deciding how long this can go on for and how quickly they will need to either escalate with a ground offensive to reduce Hamas rocket fire ( clearly the IDF & rsquo ; s extensive bombing on Tuesday did not succeed in that sufficiently ) or to find it way to a ceasefire more quickly and make new plan for the next round . The IDF will also need to rethink the speed with which it will need to move in a conflict with Hezbollah , let alone Iran .",is iron dome effective against hamas rocket a originally thought ?

It 's a shame that a Jewish director took advantage of the stage that he wa given to make antisemitic remark comparing the Holocaust to the war of no-choice that wa forced upon u .

And this is what we are fighting against . A massacre . A terror organization that say that it want to be from the river to the sea , and that mean that they want the whole state of Israel to be free of Jews . Does that remind you of somebody , saying that a whole area should be free of Jews ? That is what they are saying . And for that to happen they want to kill and murder and slaughter and rape so that this whole area will be free of Jews . So , this is the right context to look at the Holocaust and October 7 , [ at ] some similarity that they have , `` Stein said.Glazer & rsquo ; s German-language film is about the family of the commandant of Auschwitz living on the death-camp grounds.After thanking the Academy , his cast and producer , and Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum , Glazer read from a written statement , although he wa clearly emotional , a he spoke about the war in sentence fragment , saying , & ldquo ; All our choice were made to reflect and confront u in the present , not to say that what they did then , rather than what we do now .

2022-02-15 19:49:15.437,jpost,"Israel need a peace authority to pursue and maintain relation with it Arab neighbor and the Palestinians , former Israeli negotiator Gilead Sher told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday . & ldquo ; This authority will handle only peace , and peace-making and peace-preserving , & rdquo ; Sher told The Jerusalem Post after the meeting , adding that this new body would have & ldquo ; one mission statement . & rdquo ; This would be an independent authority with a commissioner that would be appointed by the Knesset , Sher said . He explained that this wa different from other governmental body such a the Foreign Ministry , the Prime Minister & rsquo ; s Office or the National Security Council , which handle a myriad of task . & ldquo ; This is a fresh new idea that is completely detached from politics of Left and Right , & rdquo ; said Sher . & ldquo ; This relates to the very basic fundamental of the establishment of the State of Israel with a Declaration of Independence of 1948 , which expressly say that Israel will seek peace and extend it arm toward it neighbor for peace and security . & rdquo ; Sher ha a long history with peace process , having served a an attorney and chief of staff for former prime minister Ehud Barak , a well a a negotiator for both Barak and former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin . Israel need to move beyond the paradigm of dealing with peace only a a necessary pursuit when the opportunity open and make it a permanent part of it national agenda , Sher said . Israel should & ldquo ; not be satisfied with short-time , ad-hoc administration whenever there is an opportunity to do something , & rdquo ; he said . During past peace process , he noted , there were temporary mechanism that were established and then dismantled . During the 2007 Annapolis process , there wa even & ldquo ; a peace administration , & rdquo ; but & ldquo ; it wa a very short-term administration without any continuity of the collective memory and the data that wa processed . & rdquo ; A Peace Authority , Sher said , would allow for a kind of continuity that is not absent . & ldquo ; This is a stable permanent body that would become one of the most important body in the state of Israel , & rdquo ; he said . Sher spoke at a time when the peace process with the Palestinians ha been frozen for almost eight year . It is also a time when Israel ha advanced peace with it neighbor under the rubric of the Abraham Accords , establishing tie with the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Morocco and Sudan . Sher said that the peace authority would work to shore up those relation a well a Israel & rsquo ; s peace treaty with Egypt and Jordan . In addition , it would prepare for normalized tie with additional Arab country . A senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies , Sher said this plan wa his initiative , and that when he put it forward , he did not represent any specific organization . He spoke during a meeting in which the FADC listened to proposal on how to advance Israeli-Palestinian relation and heard summary of pending problem area . MK Gaby Lasky ( Meretz ) told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that she could not recall when such a forum had been convened . Lasky said the idea for an administration or a peace authority could be put into place fairly quickly . It ha been a mistake to rely so heavily on a military body to represent Israel in it tie with the Palestinian Authority . It would be important for a civilian body to exist that would upgrade Israel & rsquo ; s tie with the PA , Lasky said .","israel need a peace authority , former negotiator tell knesset"

Her 10-year-old son , Neidav , wa diagnosed with leukemia in December , and they had been living at Schneider & ndash ; Children & rsquo ; s Medical Center while he received treatment . & nbsp ; I met Meirav at the Zichron Menachem annual four-wheeling trip , now in it 11th year . The Land Rover tour wa located in the Ben Shemen Forest , an area full of tree , field , and rocky terrain . Our Land Rover wa number 13 . Our driver & rsquo ; s name wa Zion , and he only had one hand . He lost his other hand in an accident in the IDF . He said he doesn & rsquo ; t let it stop him from living his life . & nbsp ; As we drove over the rock embedded in the ground , I asked Meirav about Neidav . Meirav ha four child ; her oldest is 17 . Their family life in Beit Aryeh . & nbsp ; The week before the trip , Neidav finished his treatment . & ldquo ; We beat cancer , we beat it , & rdquo ; Meirav said proudly . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; Neidav is 10 , but ha a mind like a 50-year-old , & rdquo ; she said . She recounted that throughout his treatment he had stayed positive , with the understanding that there wa no other option but to fight . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; It wa all in the head ; there wa no other option but to win . & rdquo ; Meirav said he knew everything that wa going on , and his sibling knew a well.When they learned that Neidav wa going to lose his hair , the family threw a party . His brother , Be & rsquo ; eri , and his father both decided to shave their head with Neidav so he wouldn & rsquo ; t be alone.Be & rsquo ; eri sat with u in the Land Rover . However , Neidav wa not with u because he had a fever . Part of the effect of leukemia is an extremely weak immune system . As a result of this , Neidav ha not been able to attend school . Meirav belief he will catch up , though . She said that Neidav is very smart . & ldquo ; He learned English all by himself from TV show , & rdquo ; she said proudly . & nbsp ; Neidav had to undergo chemotherapy for five month . His mother confided that it had been an extremely difficult time , but that Neidav had continuously tried to be positive . Now that the treatment is over , they can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel . & nbsp ; When we got out of the Land Rover , there wa a barbecue waiting for u with all type of meat , salad , and chip . All the kid were handed water gun , along with the volunteer & ndash ; who were either in high school or doing National Service . During the water fight , nobody wa spared . Then , the volunteer led the kid in song I knew from summer camp . One young man had drum , and others held child on their shoulder . They all stood in a circle singing and dancing while their parent sat around , talking and relaxing . There were kid of all age , ranging from all sector of Israeli society , from secular to haredi.As I stood watching , I wa approached by Tomer Baum , a parent I had spoken on the early morning bus ride from Schneider Hospital in Petah Tikva to the forest . & nbsp ; Tomer had told me about his son Yair , who is 13 year old and wa diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in December 2023 . Yair wa at a summer camp in the United States , but Tomer brought his son Aviv on the Land Rover tour . While Yair had been undergoing treatment at Sheba Medical Center , Aviv wa very scared and stressed , Tomer explained . & nbsp ; Yair & rsquo ; s treatment lasted six month . In addition to chemo , Yair & rsquo ; s doctor also attempted additional treatment . Tomer talked about the scariest day at this hospital for him , when the doctor tried to give Yair a & ldquo ; biologic & rdquo ; treatment . When the nurse left the room , Yair stopped breathing , Tomer recalled . & ldquo ; He turned purple . & rdquo ; It turned out that Yair wa having an allergic reaction to the medicine , causing the doctor to immediately cease the treatment . For Tomer , it wa the & ldquo ; worst day ever . & rdquo ; Now Yair is in remission , but the next five year are crucial , a period during which the disease could reappear . & nbsp ; Tomer said that knowing Yair had a trip to the US to look forward to during his treatment had given him hope . As Aviv wa also scared and stressed during his brother & rsquo ; s treatment , this Land Rover trip wa a way for him to have fun , relax , and be a kid , his father said.VolunteeringI ALSO spoke to Bram , a high school student who ha been volunteering with Zichron Menachem for a year and a half . As well a going on trip and helping at summer camp , he also assist individual family . & nbsp ; Bram told me about a family with five child that he began helping after the outbreak of the war with Hamas . The father wa on reserve duty , and the mother wa studying to be a doctor . One of the kid had cancer . & ldquo ; It felt like the house wa falling apart , & rdquo ; he shared . & ldquo ; I wa just trying to hold the house together . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Bram said that since the war began , there have not been enough volunteer , and many who used to travel to hospital or to help individual family could no longer do so . & nbsp ; Zichron Menachem ha several hundred volunteer . The organization wa founded 34 year ago by Chaim and Miri Ehrental , whose son Menachem battled cancer for over 14 year . According to the founder , the organization belief that the emotional well-being of his/her family is crucial to a child & rsquo ; s healing process.Zichron Menachem run a rehabilitative educational social day center , a hospitality center for family , study program , and club and workshop & ndash ; a well a annual vacation camp abroad for child during winter and summer break , and a spring camp for parent of child with cancer .

The terror group ha forcibly controlled Gaza since 2007.Hamas ha asserted that over 8,500 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed from war-related violence . Israel ha banned the entry of good , food , medicine and fuel into Gaza through it passage , but ha allowed a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the Strip through Rafah.The US ha pushed for a plan that would allow for 100 truck a day , but ha yet to meet that goal , although the number continues to rise . Aid official have said the good are not enough to prevent a humanitarian crisis.At issue in particular ha been Israel & rsquo ; s ban on fuel , which it fear Hamas would divert for military purpose . Both the US and Israel have said that Hama ha fuel that it could provide for humanitarian use.The international commuting ha focused on the civilian cost of the war , particularly the harm done to hospital and the Jabalia refugee camp a Israel battle a terror group whose infrastructure is located within a civilian population.Hospitals struggled to cope amid shutdown forced by shortage in fuel , Medical student Ezzedine Lulu , working at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza , filmed himself walking through corridor filled with sleeping child sheltering from the bombardment . `` I can heal the wound , I can stop the bleeding , I can not heal the cold of these child 's body .

2024-04-20 14:26:57.280,jpost,"Pressure is mounting on the largely pro-Iran regime mayor of the German city of Freiburg , Martin Horn , to dissolve his municipal partnership with the heavily militarized city of Isfahan in Iran that last week played a key role in the Islamic Republic & rsquo ; s massive aerial bombardment of the Jewish state.Some Iranians in Isfahan celebrated the aerial bombardment targeting Israel last week.Calls for Horn to end the twin city partnership grew after Iran & rsquo ; s regime fired over 300 missile and suicide drone at Israel . Isfahan is the main hub of Iran & rsquo ; s missile production program and it illicit nuclear weapon apparatus.Lieutenant Colonel ( Retired ) Jonathan Conricus , who served a the Israeli army 's international spokesperson from 2017 to 2023 , told the Jerusalem Post : `` I find it odd that a city still ha a connection to an official institution from the Islamic Republic of Iran . Ending the partnership would send a message to the hostile Iranian regime that this city , like all German city , adheres to German value . `` Dr . Efraim Zuroff , the world & rsquo ; s leading Nazi-hunter and head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center & rsquo ; s Jerusalem office , told the Post that the twin city partnership & ldquo ; make Freiburg look a bunch of total idiot . & rdquo ; He said that & ldquo ; To have a twin city agreement with a city in Iran doe not make any sense . It encourages Iran to continue to do what they are doing & mdash ; spreading death and destruction . & rdquo ; Zuroff stressed that & ldquo ; Freiburg is not in line with the general attitude in Germany . & rdquo ; Addressing the Iranian peopleBen Sabti , who led the IDF Spokesperson & rsquo ; s platform in Persian , which wa created to address the Iranian people directly , told the Post that & ldquo ; Iranian drone were sent from Isfahan & rdquo ; to attack Israel.Sabti , who wa born in Tehran and is research fellow for Institute for National Security Studies , added that in Isfahan & ldquo ; There are many military base & rdquo ; in & nbsp ; Isfahan & nbsp ; because it is in the heart & nbsp ; of Ian and it is & ldquo ; very secure & rdquo ; for Iran to place military installation in the central province of Isfahan.Israel , according to foreign medium report , on Friday launched a counter-strike against an air base in Isfahan and hit a key part of Iran 's S-300 air defense system . The New York Times reported on Saturday.Freiburg is widely considered one of the most hospitable European city for Iran & rsquo ; s regime , which wa classified a the world & rsquo ; s largest state-sponsor of terrorism by the Biden administration . Zuroff noted that Isfahan is the & ldquo ; center of nuclear weapon production & rdquo ; in Iran.The campaign to end the reported appeasement of Iran & rsquo ; s regime by Freiburg & rsquo ; s mayor , Martin Horn , and the left-wing Green and Social Democratic party in the city council ha been largely led by Iranian dissidents.Dr . Kazem Moussavi , a German-Iranian dissident who ha campaigned against the partnership since it wa founded in 2000 , told the Post & ldquo ; As an Iranian opposition activist and spokesman for the Green Party of Iran in Germany ( in exile ) , I have been warning Freiburg 's respective mayor , now Martin Horn , and the city council for year , in vain , that Freiburg 's relation with Isfahan are dangerous and a back door for the mullah to spread their antisemitism and Islamism in Baden-W & uuml ; rttemberg and in all of Germany . & rdquo ; Freiburg is a university town located in the southwestern German state of Baden-W & uuml ; rttemberg.Moussavi continued that & ldquo ; However , they paid no attention to my protest and report in the context of appeasement policy . They ignored that Isfahan is an execution center for opponent of the regime , the main base for uranium enrichment to produce nuclear bomb , ballistic missile and drone , and to equip the war against Israel . It ha now been proven that the Revolutionary Guard from Isfahan fired ballistic missile at Israel . If these rocket had hit Israeli city , it would have been an even more terrible crime than the Hamas October pogrom , for which the city of Freiburg would also be morally responsible . & rdquo ; The well-known German-Iranian activist added & ldquo ; If Mayor Martin Horn and the Freiburg city councilors had reflected on these danger and Israel 's attack on military installation in Isfahan , they would have to resign immediately and break off Freiburg 's relation with the city of Isfahan . This sister city partnership endangers Israel 's security . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Sheina Vojoudi , who is an associate fellow at the Gold Institute for International Strategy , told the Post , & ldquo ; Isfahan is of great strategic importance in Iran . There are military and nuclear base in Isfahan and it show how the regime is concentrated in this city and the rocket that were fired at Israel were also fired from one of the base in Isfahan . Today 's attack on Isfahan mean that this city is one of the main point where the regime can pose a threat to Israel and of course to the Iranian people because of the intense activity of the IRGC . & rdquo ; Voujoudi , who fled the Islamic Republic to Germany , added & ldquo ; The regime 's nuclear activity have almost ruined the life of the people of Isfahan and increased the rate of cancer in Isfahan . Every nuclear activity of this regime , which is based on dangerous and deadly ideology , is a warning sign for the whole world . After the rocket attack on Israel from Isfahan , it 's time for Freiburg to end it town twinning with Isfahan , and Jewish community in Germany can play a key role in ending this partnership . & rdquo ; Freiburg & rsquo ; s mayor and city government and it tiny Jewish community run by the controversial chairwoman , Irina Katz , declined to condemn Isfahan & rsquo ; s call to eradicate Israel in April . At a April demonstration held on Al-Quds day in Isfahan , the last Friday of Ramadan , the Imam of Isfahan , Ayatollah Yousef Tabatabainejad , declared , & rdquo ; It is our obligation to support the oppressed Muslims who have been oppressed and we hope that , with divine providence in this path of resistance , we will be able to wipe the Zionist regime off the face of the earth . & rdquo ; Katz took to the street last year to protest Prime Minister & rsquo ; s Benjamin Netanyahu & rsquo ; s hotly debated effort to reform the judicial system . She ha not called for the end of the Freiburg-Isfahan partnership.The German state of Baden-W & uuml ; rttemberg , where Freiburg is located , ha enabled Iran & rsquo ; s chemical missile weapon program . In 2018 , the Post reported the company Krempel , located in Baden-W & uuml ; rttemberg , sold technology to Iranian regime businessmen that wa later used in the production of chemical rocket that resulted in a Syrian regime gas attack on civilian . The chemical missile attack resulted in 21 injury , including many children.It is unclear if the Krempel technology wa used in Iranian missile fired at Israel . & nbsp ; The Green party governor of Baden-W & uuml ; rttemberg , Winfried Kretschmann , ha permitted a flourishing trade relationship to exist between Iran & rsquo ; s regime and German bank and engineering company in his state . The Post previously & nbsp ; reported on Kretschmann & rsquo ; s financial support in the amount of $ 32,000 for an antisemitic Palestinian Christian pastor who support BDS.The Wiesenthal Center & rsquo ; s Rabbi Abraham Cooper ha urged civil society group like the German-Israel Friendship Society in Stuttgart ( DIG-Stuttgart ) to call for the end of the partnership between Isfahan and Freiburg.After week of mounting pressure on the DIG-Stuttgart , the group sent an email to the Post on Friday calling for the termination of the partnership . When asked if the DIG-Stuttgart will urge Mayor Frank Nopper of Stuttgart , the capital of Baden-W & uuml ; rttemberg , to delete information for the pro-Hamas group Palestine Stuttgart Committee on the city website , Oliver Vrankovic , the chairman of the DIG-Stuttgart , refused to comment.The NGO Palestine Stuttgart Committee ha raised fund for the Israel-designated terrorist organization Samidoun , which ha an office in Iran . Germany classified Samidoun a terrorist entity after the October 7 massacre . & nbsp ; Susan Kaufmann , a spokeswoman for Stuttgart 's mayor , told the Post that & rdquo ; The state capital Stuttgart ha reinstated the address of the Palestine Committee Stuttgart on the city 's homepage in consideration of the legal position represented by the Stuttgart Administrative Court . & rdquo ; German legal expert and pro-Israel advocate argue that Nopper is not serious about stopping the financing of Hamas and Samidoun because he could delete all NGO entry on the city & rsquo ; s website to ensure there is no financing of Palestinian terrorism.When asked if Nopper would delete all NGO entry on the city & rsquo ; s website , Kaufmann refused to comment.When asked if the DIG-Stuttgart will urge the Stuttgart-based bank LBBW to close the account of Palestine Stuttgart Committee , Vrankovic declined to comment . The DIG-Stuttgart and it national organization DIG are financed by the German foreign ministry . It is unclear why DIG-Stuttgart retains a dovish posture toward the financing and support of Hamas and Samidoun by & nbsp ; Stuttgart and the state of Baden-W & uuml ; rttemberg . Stuttgart and the state government reportedly own nearly 50 % of the LBBW bank . & nbsp ; The LBBW bank is opposing the trend in Germany to counter alleged financing of pro-Palestinian terrorist organization , in which bank have closed account of pro-Hamas group . Last month , the Berlin Sparkasse bank suspended the account of the far-left and pro-Hamas group & ldquo ; Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Middle East & rdquo ; because of alleged tie with Palestinian terrorist and extremists.In 2019 , after a series of Post investigative report on the bank account of the pro-BDS group & ldquo ; Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Middle East , & rdquo ; the German Bank for Social Economy in Cologne & nbsp ; closed the organization & rsquo ; s account.In December , the Post reported Yesh Atid head MK Yair Lapid demanded German authority disrupt and end Hamas funding stream in Germany . Lapid told German news organization Die Welt & rsquo ; s TV program that & ldquo ; there are people in Germany who have bank account , there are people who perhaps also personally support Hamas activist . And they are working on transferring money to Hamas . & rdquo ; Mayor Horn and the Green and Social Democratic party in Freiburg & rsquo ; s city council refused to answer numerous Post press query . All of the major party in the city council ( with the exception of the tiny pro-Israel JUPI Party ) and Mayor Horn have remained wedded to the partnership with Isfahan.In 2021 , the Post broke the story that the University of Freiburg stopped it cooperation agreement with Isfahan University.The city of Freiburg ha been embroiled in numerous pro-Iran regime scandal . Freiburg rolled out the red carpet for Mohammad Khatami in 208 , who served a Iran 's president from 1997 to 2005 , and praised the late French Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy.Saeed Laylaz , former advisor to President Khatami , recently said that & ldquo ; If Israel or the US respond to the Islamic Republic & rsquo ; s attack , the Islamic Republic will test it first nuclear bomb , & ldquo ; according to Iran International.The New York-based Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) wrote in 2016 & ldquo ; the Islamic Association of the University of Isfahan ha announced that it will hold it own Holocaust cartoon contest . The Islamic Association held a similar contest in 2015 .

He met with Abbas after holding talk with Israeli official in Tel Aviv and Arab leader in Jordan over the weekend.In his meeting with Arab leader , such a King Abdullah in Jordan on Saturday , he attempted to assuage their fear over the possibility of a forced expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza.US President Joe Biden issued the same message to Abdullah when he spoke with the monarch last Tuesday.They & ldquo ; agreed that it is critical to ensure that Palestinians are not forcibly displaced outside of Gaza , & rdquo ; the White House said after the call.US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby echoed that sentiment in speaking with reporter last Wednesday.He rejected any report of a plan to expel Palestinians from Gaza . & ldquo ; I want to stress that is not our policy .
