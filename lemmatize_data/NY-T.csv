. from “ the new york time , ” i ’ m sabrina tavernise . and this is “ the daily . ” [ music playing ] in an unexpected speech last week , president biden revealed the detail of a secret proposal intended to end the war in gaza . most surprising wa where that proposal had come from . today , my colleague isabel kershner explains biden ’ s gambit and the difficult choice it present for israel ’ s leader , benjamin netanyahu . it ’ s wednesday , june 5 . isabel , tell u about this speech from president biden last friday at the white house . so last friday , president biden made a speech . and it came at a pivotal moment in the war because for week beforehand , the whole world had been focused on israel ’ s long delayed invasion of the city of rafah , the southernmost city in the gaza strip and also the city that about a million displaced palestinian had fled to to find refuge from fighting in other area of the gaza strip . so understandably , there wa huge concern internationally and particularly a lot of pressure coming from the white house for israel not to go into rafah . it wa just considered way too risky . but for the israeli , they were saying the last battalion of hamas are there . many hostage are there . and without taking control of that area , the israeli felt they wouldn ’ t have accomplished anything . so in the end , they did begin to move into the eastern part of rafah . but then a the israeli were operating in eastern rafah with their tank and ground troop , the israeli on may 26 carried out a strike , an airstrike . this wa an attack meant to target two hamas operative . and they did , in fact , strike those two operative and killed them with what they said were the smallest missile that their jet could carry . unfortunately , that strike then set off an absolutely devastating fire because the area the strike took place in is right by a camp of makeshift shack and tent where hundred or thousand of palestinian were sheltering . this fire ripped through the tent and ended up killing 45 civilian according to the gazan health authority . and it wa exactly the kind of disaster that everybody had feared if israel were to operate in this crowded , southern , dusty border town . which presumably put a lot more pressure on the biden white house to do something about this war . that ’ s right . now , we know that the white house , the biden administration , would very much like to see this war come to an end a soon a possible . and then on friday — good afternoon . before i begin my remark — — president biden give a speech . and surprisingly — now to another issue . — this speech when it turn to the israel-hamas war wa not about rafah . in fact , it wa something totally different and much bigger . israel ha now offered — israel is offering a comprehensive new proposal . it ’ s a road map to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostage . what president biden described a the outline of an israeli proposal for a ceasefire truce and hostage release deal with hamas that would end the war . this proposal ha been transmitted by qatar to hamas . today , i want to lay out his term for the american citizen and for the world . and , isabel , what did he mean exactly by the israeli proposal ? well , there ’ s been a lot of smoke and mirror around this whole process of talk and negotiation between israel and hamas . and , in fact , the last time we saw a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release wa at the end of last november . but , in fact , there had been this on again , off again attempt at getting negotiation back on track over the last few week . and it soon came to light that this wa the latest israeli proposal that wa apparently presented . and this proposal it turn out wa unanimously approved a a basis for the negotiation by israel ’ s war cabinet . and here is an american president spelling out this previously undisclosed israeli position on television . absolutely . and the israeli public knew nothing about this . so what doe biden actually say ? what doe he say is in this proposal ? ok , well , what he say — this new proposal ha three phase . three . he present it a a deal in three phase , which is generally in line with all the previous plan of the last few month . and the first phase would involve a six week temporary ceasefire during which a certain number of hostage — — including woman , the elderly , the wounded — — the most vulnerable one — there are american hostage who would be released at this stage . and we want them home . — would be exchanged for hundred of palestinian prisoner in israeli jail . and israeli force would be withdrawing from population center within the gaza strip . — with 600 truck carrying aid into gaza every single day . humanitarian aid would be flowing at a much greater level and generally the beginning of a change in atmosphere and climate . so this seems in some way like the temporary ceasefire in november , right ? woman and child , vulnerable hostage , a cease in hostility for six week . what about phase two ? well , here we get to the crucial part because during phase one , the side are supposed to start negotiating phase two . now , i ’ ll be straight with you . there are a number of detail to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two . and phase two is supposed to culminate in all remaining living hostage released and exchanged again for many more palestinian prisoner from israeli jail . this would involve also the withdrawal of israeli troop from the gaza strip . and in his speech , president biden doe say that a long a hamas life up to it commitment , the temporary ceasefire would become , in the word of the israeli proposal — — the cessation of hostility permanently . ” — essentially meaning the end of the war . so biden is actually talking about the end of the war . he ’ s saying that out loud , which is not something we ’ ve been hearing from israel at all , at least publicly . on the contrary , in fact , our colleague wrote a story at the end of last week when one senior israeli official said the war would last until at least the end of the year . so this is something very new . absolutely . and then we get to phase three because there ’ s a third phase to this plan . and that is moving ahead already to the day after the war , which ha been kept very vague by the israeli up to now . and the phase that president biden outlined wa essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for gaza . that ’ s the offer that ’ s now on the table and what we ’ ve been asking for . it ’ s what we need . so the president is saying that this is a deal that should be accepted , that meet the requirement of both side , that can point to a path forward . and he make a couple of point to bolster that — the people of israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they ’ ve devastated hamas force . — one of which is that in his view , hamas ha already been sufficiently degraded and devastated to the point where , a president biden put it , hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another october 7 . in other word , that goal of total victory that netanyahu talk about , biden is actually saying they ’ ve accomplished it . the israeli have accomplished it . not really , actually . he take on netanyahu on the total victory slogan — indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring israel and will not bring down — will only bog down israel in gaza , draining the economic , military , and human resource and furthering israel ’ s isolation in the world . — and say that total victory is a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal that would basically mean indefinite war because what doe total victory mean ? you can ’ t kill every last hamas operative . and even if you did , presumably there would be many more palestinian who would come to replace them . and in a way , he ’ s using this speech to go over the head of netanyahu and go straight to the israeli people and present them with these term to in a way corner netanyahu , but also to put down the gauntlet to hamas and say , here are the term . they sound very like the term hamas wa asking for and putting hamas equally on the spot to come back to the table even though israel is still fighting in rafah . it ’ s time to begin this new stage , for the hostage to come home , for israel to be secure , for the suffering to stop . it ’ s time for this war to end , for the day after to begin . thank you very much . so biden is essentially saying here , listen . israel , you have won the war effectively . hamas is degraded . now it ’ s time to accept the ceasefire deal that you yourself have designed . what wa the reaction inside israel ? the initial reaction took a while to come because president biden made his speech . and it landed at about 8:30 in the evening on friday israel time . and this is the time where many , many family are sitting around their sabbath dinner table , a i wa with my family and friend , not watching the news , not looking at phone for the most part . observant jew have actually switched off for the sabbath and aren ’ t going to hear any news until saturday night . and a the news did begin to trickle out , it really shook israel up . and this leaf netanyahu in a great bind because for month , he ’ s really been playing for time and juggling competing interest and really not having to make a decision one way or the other on what come next . we ’ ve been hearing that rafah is really the last stronghold of hamas , and this is something the military ha to do . but after that , there wa just a kind of void and no news on the hostage or a ceasefire or a deal on the horizon . and so when this speech wa made , suddenly it shook up everything . and netanyahu is suddenly facing a very crucial choice . we ’ ll be right back . so , isabel , you said that this is a very important moment for netanyahu , that now he really is facing a choice . what doe he do ? what doe he come out and say ? so his office actually put out a statement . and his first response wa that israel is sticking to it objective of the destruction of hamas ’ s military and governing capability . and he said the actual proposal put forward by israel would allow israel to uphold these principle . now , this wa a slightly ambiguous response that you could pas in different way . he wasn ’ t exactly denying that this wa an israeli proposal . and indeed , we quickly learned that , in fact , israel ’ s war cabinet had unanimously voted on the general outline of what president biden had presented . he wasn ’ t denying it . but the one thing missing from that statement wa this declaration we ’ d been hearing for month on end that the war wouldn ’ t end until there wa total victory . that had gone . so total victory had gone , which is a difference , which mean potentially the war goal have shifted a little bit . well , the way he articulated it is talking about the degradation or dismantling of hamas ’ s capability a opposed to talking about the total elimination of hamas a a movement . and then he followed up . his office put out another statement on saturday , also still during the sabbath , which wa a little stronger . he said under the proposal , israel would insist on it condition being met , these same war objective , before a permanent cease fire is put in place and that any suggestion that israel would agree to that permanent ceasefire before the condition are met would be a non-starter . but again , it wa kind of conditional and could be interpreted in different way . at what point doe one declare that the capability have been dismantled or sufficiently degraded ? so it left a lot of room for maneuver . and so what is netanyahu up to here , isabel ? i think he ’ s trying to balance all these competing side . he ’ s seems to be trying not to torpedo the chance of this deal but at the same time to be able to hang on politically when he ha a very serious challenge looming within his government should this deal go ahead . so tell me about that challenge . israel ’ s government is formed of a coalition of party . netanyahu ’ s likud is the main party . but it totally relies for it majority in parliament on it partner in the coalition . and they include two ultra-orthodox party and two far right party . and the far right party have both come out explicitly saying that should this deal a outlined by president biden go ahead , they will not be party to it . so netanyahu face this real political danger on his right . that ’ s right . so there are the leader of these two right wing party who he relies on for his coalition government . he relies on them for his majority in parliament . and the leader of those party are itamar ben-gvir , who ’ s the national security minister , and bezalel smotrich , who is currently the finance minister . now , neither of these party nor their leader are sitting in the much more tight and small war cabinet that actually oversees and directs and make the decision on the course of the war in gaza . they were seen a way too extreme to be part of that forum . that forum is much more reflective of the national consensus . but these party are part of the broader government . and they have threatened not only to oppose the deal a outlined by president biden should it go ahead . but they have actually vowed if it doe go ahead , they would withdraw their support to netanyahu and bring his government down . and if his government were to collapse a a result , he would then be facing a new election . now , he ha been trying to stave off the end of the war and the prospect of new election ever since october 7 because then he ’ s in danger of facing that public reckoning for the perceived failure that the government ’ s policy failure , the military ’ s failure , the intelligence failure leading up to the hamas led attack of october the 7 . but we really might be getting to crunch time when it come to his political lifeline here . so this is a pretty dramatic moment for netanyahu then , right ? i mean , he ’ s under tremendous pressure from biden , his biggest ally . biden ’ s basically asking him to choose between this deal , which mean the end of the war , something his coalition partner , these hard right guy , really don ’ t want , and his own power essentially , right ? staying alive politically or the end of the war and the hostage coming home . that is a very stark choice . absolutely . and then there are other choice that he ha to weigh because israel ha been increasingly isolated and under international censure for it prosecution of the war in gaza . netanyahu himself is facing the prospect of possible arrest warrant being put out against him from the international criminal court in the hague . israel is in the dark on a genocide case in the international court of justice in the hague . so should he go ahead with this deal , he ha been offered sweetener like an invitation to address congress . and this would in a way be a way of bringing him back into the fold . so , isabel , say netanyahu approves this proposal . how likely is it that the right wing , smotrich and ben-gvir , actually do leave the government ? i mean , they would be giving up power , too , no ? they would . and if we look at all the opinion poll being done in israel in the last few month , bezalel smotrich and his religious zionism party for one would barely scrape back into parliament in another election . and therefore , there ’ s a lot at stake for him , too , and for itamar ben-gvir because if the next government that ’ s formed is not going to be a right wing and far right government , he would find himself out of power , too . but , isabel , let ’ s say they do leave . what happens in that scenario ? well , the assumption is that the government would collapse . it would lose it majority . and naturally , the knesset would vote to dissolve itself and set a date for a new election , which would have to come within five month . and during that period , this government would turn into a caretaker government . now , usually a caretaker government that ’ s a transitional one in that period before election isn ’ t supposed to make dramatic decision for the country . but being a caretaker government during wartime , this put israel in uncharted political territory . then theoretically , if we were to ask could such a government even approve a deal once it had been negotiated , even without the support of those far right party , apparently there would still be enough in favor to see it through . interesting . so it seems like there are a lot of possibility for how this could go . but it doe in a way rely on netanyahu deciding what israel ’ s course will be . and it seems like he probably need to land on one of these option . what do you think he ’ s going to do ? well , it might not end up being black and white , take the deal or not take the deal . we might end up seeing something in between because i think netanyahu , who is facing huge public pressure to bring back those hostage who still are alive , would definitely want to move ahead with at least that first part of the deal that would see a six week temporary ceasefire in return for the most vulnerable hostage . and then you get into the much trickier part of that negotiation for the next stage , which would involve essentially ending the war . and it could be that we might see netanyahu wanting to proceed with this deal but only partially and then get to a point where it can ’ t go further . and netanyahu is probably very keenly aware of the american political timetable . there are skeptic here who say that by labor day , all the american attention is going to be focused on america ’ s own internal politics running up to the november election and that netanyahu basically just ha to survive another 90 day to get to that point , at which point the pressure subsides . so this is a scenario in which he just basically run out the clock . he keep on that tightrope . that ’ s a possibility , absolutely , and one that he would be very adept at doing if the past is anything to go by . ok , so there are a number of way netanyahu could actually handle this . how should we think about what biden ha really accomplished here ? well , i think it ’ s hard to say that one speech is going to change the course or the outcome of this war . but it certainly ha crystallized the issue and brought them out into the light after month and month of murkiness that netanyahu wa able to in a way hide behind and operate within . and i think now he ’ s in the spotlight . and assuming that hamas is willing to accept and go along with this negotiation for this proposal , the israeli public ’ s expectation have certainly been risen now toward a deal . and all eye are now on netanyahu to see which way he will go . isabel , thank you . thank you so much . in an interview with “ time magazine ” published on tuesday , biden wa asked whether netanyahu wa prolonging the war in gaza in an effort to hold on to office . biden said , quote , “ there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion . ” we ’ ll be right back . here ’ s what else you should know today . on tuesday , republican lawmaker in arizona voted to put a ballot measure before voter in november that would make unlawfully crossing the border from mexico a crime in the state . the move would put the border crisis directly onto the ballot in a key swing state , potentially firing up anti-immigration conservative voter . it is similar to a law passed in texas earlier this year , currently held up in court after it wa challenged by the biden administration . and the result of a major election in india have been tallied . and they are deeply disappointing for india ’ s prime minister narendra modi . modi appeared to have secured a third consecutive term in office . however , his bjp party did not deliver the landslide victory it had promised and even lost it majority in parliament . now modi and the bjp must come to an agreement with other party in order to form a coalition government in india ’ s parliamentary system .

biden revealed the detail of a secret proposal intended to end the war in gaza . most surprising wa where that proposal had come from . today , my colleague isabel kershner explains biden ’ s gambit and the difficult choice it present for israel ’ s leader , benjamin netanyahu . it ’ s wednesday , june 5 . isabel , tell u about this speech from president biden last friday at the white house . so last friday , president biden made a speech . and it came at a pivotal moment in the war because for week beforehand , the whole world had been focused on israel ’ s long delayed invasion of the city of rafah , the southernmost city in the gaza strip and also the city that about a million displaced palestinian had fled to to find refuge from fighting in other area of the gaza strip . so understandably , there wa huge concern internationally and particularly a lot of pressure coming from the white house for israel not to go into rafah . it wa just considered way too risky . but for the israeli , they were saying the last battalion of hamas are there . many hostage are there . and without taking control of that area , the israeli felt they wouldn ’ t have accomplished anything . so in the end , they did begin to move into the eastern part of rafah . but then a the israeli were operating in eastern rafah with their tank and ground troop , the israeli on may 26 carried out a strike , an airstrike . this wa an attack meant to target two hamas operative . and they did , in fact , strike those two operative and killed them with what they said were the smallest missile that their jet could carry . unfortunately , that strike then set off an absolutely devastating fire because the area the strike took place in is right by a camp of makeshift shack and tent where hundred or thousand of palestinian were sheltering . this fire ripped through the tent and ended up killing 45 civilian according to the gazan health authority . and it wa exactly the kind of disaster that everybody had feared if israel were to operate in this crowded , southern , dusty border town . which presumably put a lot more pressure on the biden white house to do something about this war . that ’ s right . now , we know that the white house , the biden administration , would very much like to see this war come to an end a soon a possible . and then on friday — good afternoon . before i begin my remark — — president biden give a speech . and surprisingly — now to another issue . — this speech when it turn to the israel-hamas war wa not about rafah . in fact , it wa something totally different and much bigger . israel ha now offered — israel is offering a comprehensive new proposal . it ’ s a road map to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostage . what president biden described a the outline of an israeli proposal for a ceasefire truce and hostage release deal with hamas that would end the war . this proposal ha been transmitted by qatar to hamas . today , i want to lay out his term for the american citizen and for the world . and , isabel , what did he mean exactly by the israeli proposal ? well , there ’ s been a lot of smoke and mirror around this whole process of talk and negotiation between israel and hamas . and , in fact , the last time we saw a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release wa at the end of last november . but , in fact , there had been this on again , off again attempt at getting negotiation back on track over the last few week . and it soon came to light that this wa the latest israeli proposal that wa apparently presented . and this proposal it turn out wa unanimously approved a a basis for the negotiation by israel ’ s war cabinet . and here is an american president spelling out this previously undisclosed israeli position on television . absolutely . and the israeli public knew nothing about this . so what doe biden actually say ? what doe he say is in this proposal ? ok , well , what he say — this new proposal ha three phase . three . he present it a a deal in three phase , which is generally in line with all the previous plan of the last few month . and the first phase would involve a six week temporary ceasefire during which a certain number of hostage — — including woman , the elderly , the wounded — — the most vulnerable one — there are american hostage who would be released at this stage . and we want them home . — would be exchanged for hundred of palestinian prisoner in israeli jail . and israeli force would be withdrawing from population center within the gaza strip . — with 600 truck carrying aid into gaza every single day . humanitarian aid would be flowing at a much greater level and generally the beginning of a change in atmosphere and climate . so this seems in some way like the temporary ceasefire in november , right ? woman and child , vulnerable hostage , a cease in hostility for six week . what about phase two ? well , here we get to the crucial part because during phase one , the side are supposed to start negotiating phase two . now , i ’ ll be straight with you . there are a number of detail to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two . and phase two is supposed to culminate in all remaining living hostage released and exchanged again for many more palestinian prisoner from israeli jail . this would involve also the withdrawal of israeli troop from the gaza strip . and in his speech , president biden doe say that a long a hamas life up to it commitment , the temporary ceasefire would become , in the word of the israeli proposal — — the cessation of hostility permanently . ” — essentially meaning the end of the war . so biden is actually talking about the end of the war . he ’ s saying that out loud , which is not something we ’ ve been hearing from israel at all , at least publicly . on the contrary , in fact , our colleague wrote a story at the end of last week when one senior israeli official said the war would last until at least the end of the year . so this is something very new . absolutely . and then we get to phase three because there ’ s a third phase to this plan . and that is moving ahead already to the day after the war , which ha been kept very vague by the israeli up to now . and the phase that president biden outlined wa essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for gaza . that ’ s the offer that ’ s now on the table and what we ’ ve been asking for . it ’ s what we need . so the president is saying that this is a deal that should be accepted , that meet the requirement of both side , that can point to a path forward . and he make a couple of point to bolster that — the people of israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they ’ ve devastated hamas force . — one of which is that in his view , hamas ha already been sufficiently degraded and devastated to the point where , a president biden put it , hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another october 7 . in other word , that goal of total victory that netanyahu talk about , biden is actually saying they ’ ve accomplished it . the israeli have accomplished it . not really , actually . he take on netanyahu on the total victory slogan — indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring israel and will not bring down — will only bog down israel in gaza , draining the economic , military , and human resource and furthering israel ’ s isolation in the world . — and say that total victory is a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal that would basically mean indefinite war because what doe total victory mean ? you can ’ t kill every last hamas operative . and even if you did , presumably there would be many more palestinian who would come to replace them . and in a way , he ’ s using this speech to go over the head of netanyahu and go straight to the israeli people and present them with these term to in a way corner netanyahu , but also to put down the gauntlet to hamas and say , here are the term . they sound very like the term hamas wa asking for and putting hamas equally on the spot to come back to the table even though israel is still fighting in rafah . it ’ s time to begin this new stage , for the hostage to come home , for israel to be secure , for the suffering to stop . it ’ s time for this war to end , for the day after to begin . thank you very much . so biden is essentially saying here , listen . israel , you have won the war effectively . hamas is degraded . now it ’ s time to accept the ceasefire deal that you yourself have designed . what wa the reaction inside israel ? the initial reaction took a while to come because president biden made his speech . and it landed at about 8:30 in the evening on friday israel time . and this is the time where many , many family are sitting around their sabbath dinner table , a i wa with my family and friend ,

so first , let me just give you the context of what happened . this happened in northern gaza , the place that ha been at war the longest . that ’ s where israeli ground force began their invasion of the gaza strip . many people have left the north . but we do know that some 300,000 people are still there . the people who have remained there are really living through very desperate condition . very little aid ha come in to the north of gaza since the war started and especially in recent week . food is barely available for the people who ’ ve remained there . the un ha been warning of a famine that is looming over the territory . hiba , why is there so little aid getting into northern gaza in particular ? well , first of all , there ’ s less aid getting into the gaza strip in general , not just the north . there ’ s multiple reason a to why that is . but one of the main reason is that israel itself ha been very slow to approve permit and often denies permit for aid truck and aid convoy to come in , specifically to the north . because israel say that they don ’ t want the aid to end up in the hand of hamas , that they don ’ t want them to get a hold of the package . got it . when israel doe approve the permit and the aid truck start their journey , there ’ s multiple hurdle that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people . some of these hurdle include the widespread destruction in gaza . there ’ s vast damage across the gaza strip . road have been destroyed , there ’ s rubble everywhere , and it ’ s very difficult for the truck to actually move through that rubble and through those road . then these aid convoy have to go through multiple israeli checkpoint on the way . there ’ s often significant delay at these checkpoint by israeli soldier who are inspecting the aid . this make it hard for the truck to make it from where they enter in the south all the way to the north in the specific safety window that they ’ re given . sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they got delayed so much that they can ’ t keep going . hm . but there ’ s a particular problem with the north , where fighting ha been going on the longest . the civil order is now breaking down , essentially . we know that frequent israeli strike on palestinian policeman meant that there ’ s really no one to run security for official group and for aid convoy , leaving them vulnerable to attack by local gang who are trying to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it , and also , hungry and desperate civilian who are trying to grab the aid and take a much a they can , which mean that they end up stealing some of it , looting some of it , while it ’ s still on the way . right . so it ’ s lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown . i mean , this is kind of the downstream effect of extended war in a particular place . there ’ s a power vacuum . that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the united nation to be able to operate safely . right . the few aid truck that do come in have had to either suspend their aid delivery into the north or have not been able to deliver aid there . the last time unrwa , the un agency in charge of palestinian refugee , tried to bring truck to the north wa nearly a month ago . but they said that one of their convoy came under fire . another major aid provider , the world food program , said that they haven ’ t delivered aid there in over three week . they cited all of the reason we talked about for this suspension . so while aid hasn ’ t been coming into the north , people have been growing more desperate and hungry and the situation there ha been getting worse , which ha been raising international alarm . there ’ s been increased call on israel to let aid go through to the north and to alleviate the suffering of the resident there . so israel partnered with these local palestinian businessmen in gaza , and they promised to secure the aid convoy that the businessmen would supply and that would make their way into the north . they successfully did this three time last week . so people started being very hopeful that more would come , and ahead of the fourth delivery , they started to gather at this distribution point right outside of gaza city in the north . that brings u to thursday ’ s incident . [ music playing ] so last thursday around 4:45 am , around 38 aid truck reached this distribution point . they start getting closer to the crowd of people who had camped there overnight waiting for this aid to come . when the people see the truck coming , they ’ re very desperate . they surround them . they get on top of them . then at some point , israeli soldier start firing shot . then it turned violent very fast . it ended with 118 palestinian dead and 760 injured . this is where the account diverge . ok . so let ’ s start with the israeli account . what do they say happened ? so the israeli military said that it wa trying to secure the convoy and it had tank nearby to make sure that the convoy reached the area . it did acknowledge that it troop had opened fire at the crowd , but they said that they opened fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approached their troop and endangered their life . they said the shot that were fired weren ’ t really the reason why so many people died , but the reason that so many people died wa because , in the chaos of all of it , they trampled each other and many had died from suffocation or trampling , and also that the truck had run over some of the people who were trying to run away . oh , god . so the israeli don ’ t deny actually shooting , but they say it wa more about controlling the crowd , kind of a warning shot type thing , and that this wa not the way people actually died . they say the way people actually died wa suffocation or being crushed by the aid truck themselves . right . what did the gazan health authority say ? so the gazan health authority have actually been calling this the flour massacre , or the massacre of the hungry stomach . because what they ’ re saying is that israeli force fired at a crowd of hungry and desperate people who were waiting for aid . witness and palestinian who were there have said that although some people were trampled and possibly run over by the truck , that wa not the main reason for the high death toll . most of the people who were injured or killed were injured and killed by israeli fire . so the gazan health authority are essentially saying this wa a massacre by israel . right . do we know , hiba , what actually did happen ? what have you guy found in your reporting ? well , the israeli military released drone footage that it claimed showed a mass stampede in which gazans are trampled . but that video only added to the confusion of the sequence of event . the quality and the length of the clip made it more difficult to confirm these claim . right . it wa just grainy . there wa no sound . you saw people scramble and run , but you didn ’ t understand why . right . the drone footage wa heavily edited . it left out key moment . but it did show hundred of people circling around the truck and hoping to catch a bag of flour . then suddenly , we see people start to panic and run in multiple direction . then they released another clip in which we see two israeli tank that are positioned about a quarter mile down the road . then we see about a dozen body lying around them . we see people crawling and ducking for cover . [ crowd noise ] but we did have another video that wa released by al jazeera . [ gunfire ] and it showed a crowd near the aid convoy . and it also captured the sound of gunfire and showed multiple tracer round , which is a special type of ammunition that help troop fine tune their targeting when it ’ s dark . the tracer round originated from the direction of a nearby israeli military base . so although that did not conclude that the shot came from the direction of the israeli military , it did add another layer of evidence . so hiba , it sound like these video are suggestive but not conclusive . but what did the people you spoke to on the ground say , the eyewitness and survivor and doctor you spoke with . right . we spoke to witness and survivor a well a doctor at the hospital that have taken in the people who were wounded and killed . they said that most of the people had died or were wounded by gunshot . the doctor who run one of the four main hospital in the area that took in the casualty told me that out of the 13 people who were killed and the 170 people who were wounded that the hospital took in , all of the injury were of gunshot wound . he said that they didn ’ t see any injury that coincided with those of a stampede or people being run over by truck . that account echo the one that we ’ ve heard from witness and people who were there , who saw people get shot and fall to the ground next to them . but in the chaos of everything , people were not checking who ’ s dead and who ’ s wounded . they were just taking the flour , and they were running for their life . and although the account differ on both side , what we do know is that many hungry and desperate people died while trying to get food and secure aid in a place where famine is looming and starvation is rampant . that ’ s what i spent the last few week reporting on . i ’ m trying to understand how people in the north of gaza specifically are surviving with such little food . we ’ ll be right back . so hiba , i want to talk about what people are doing to survive in northern gaza . but before we get to that , what is the big picture on the state of hunger in gaza ? hunger ha reached unprecedented level in gaza and specifically in northern gaza . we ’ re starting to already see report of child dying from malnutrition and dehydration . this week , the health ministry said that 15 child have died from malnutrition and dehydration at just one of northern gaza ’ s hospital . wow , 15 child have actually died ? yes . we also have the un and aid organization saying that one in six child in northern gaza were acutely malnutritioned and that more than 90 percent of child under two are facing severe food poverty . the un humanitarian coordinator said that a quarter of all gazan resident are one step away from famine . how exactly are people surviving , hiba ? i mean , you ’ re talking to people in northern gaza . what are they saying ? i ’ ve been reporting on hunger for week . i ’ ve talked to people about what they ’ re doing in order to survive with such little food . [ non-english speech ] . [ non-english speech ] . i recently talked to one woman whose experience is very typical in northern gaza . her name is ghada krayem . she ’ s a 23-year-old woman from the north who stayed in the north and didn ’ t flee . tell me about ghada . [ non-english speech ] . ghada is one of 10 kid . she ha six sister and three brother . she ’ s actually gaza ’ s first female solar power engineer . she ’ s won many award internationally . she ’ s also the sole provider for her family . she ’ s used the money that she won from these grant and competition to help her family through this war . with that money , she actually stockpiled a bunch of food in the beginning of the war , expecting the situation to deteriorate . she bought flour and milk and canned food and everything they might need . they stockpiled it in their home . how is it that they ’ re still in northern gaza ? well , actually , they tried to stay in their home for a long a they possibly could , until the ground fighting really basically reached their doorstep . [ non-english speech ] . at one point , early on during israel ’ s ground invasion of the north — [ non-english speech ] . — israeli soldier came to their building and they forced them out . they asked everyone to leave the building , and they detained all of the men and the boy , who were later released . she wa forced to leave with nothing . they took nothing with them , like many other gazans . and they moved . they moved 12 time since . wow . one of those time wa to the south , where they got there and they realized that it actually wasn ’ t much safer . it wasn ’ t better for them . so they realized that they should probably just go back to the north and stay a close a possible to their home in case they ’ re able to go back later . but that never happened because israeli force took up their home a a military base and they were there for two week , she said . [ non-english speech ] . after they ’ d left , two week later , she went back to check on her home . it wa burned . there wa nothing left , including the food that she ’ d stockpiled . now she ’ s sheltering with 50 member of her extended family , including child , in a two bedroom apartment in the north . 50 people in a two bedroom apartment ? that is extraordinary . so what did they do for food early in the war ? well , she told me that in the beginning of the war , they still were able to find some thing to buy and eat , like rice and vegetable . but — [ non-english speech ] . she said that by the end of december , basically , when aid to the north became less frequent and thing that they were eating had started to run out , including flour , which became much less available and much more expensive . they didn ’ t know what to do . i mean , they had nothing to eat , so they started mixing water with starch to eat . they were having one meal a day . and the child were constantly hungry , so they had to find an alternative . that alternative wa animal food . [ non-english speech ] . so she told me that they started grinding up , really , any animal food that they could find . so rabbit food and bird food and hay and fodder , really anything that they could get their hand on . they would use that to make bread with . but the bread wa very dry , and it smelled bad , it tasted bad , and it made their stomach hurt . but she said that the one that wa the worst for her wa the bird food . [ non-english speech ] . she said the bird food tasted and smelled a if you were sitting with a bunch of chicken . the smell wa very bad and the taste wa even worse . [ non-english speech ] . but she told me that even though this stuff tasted and smelled bad , they really tried to make it a less awful a possible . she told me that one of her cousin sheltering with her loved to bake , and she made really tasty sweet before the war . so basically , she tried to make the most out of these ingredient . she wa making dessert using the corn mill and the rabbit food . she wa also making other savory dish that they liked and they ate frequently before the war . [ non-english speech ] . she used the animal feed to make maftoul , which is the palestinian version of couscous . so she wa making it with the ground up animal feed ? yes . but that wa still not enough . at that point , ghada and her family were only eating one meal a day and that wa not enough for them or the child in the family . [ non-english speech ] . [ non-english speech ] . she told me that her little sister , two-year-old elene , who is actually the youngest person sheltering with them , wa hungry all the time . she wa going to sleep cry and waking up cry . and she loved milk , but they ran out of milk more than two month ago . so what they ’ ve been doing is basically giving her expired juice . it wa actually not even juice , it ’ s a concentrated juice that they would mix with water . because it wa expired , it wa making her sick . but that wa the only thing that they could give her in place of milk . when they were able to , they would give her sugar cane that they would find in the market and lemon a a snack . sometimes when those weren ’ t even available , they would just give her gum to chew on and stop cry , to silence her hunger . [ non-english speech ] . so i asked her if they had been able to get any aid since the war started . she told me that her brother muhammad , who ’ s 30 year old , had been going to the distribution site and sleeping on the beach just waiting for aid . he would leave at 7:00 in the morning and come back at 3:00 am . he slept there for three day this week . so her brother had been sleeping on the beach in hope that there would be aid dropped off here . so what happened ? so after waiting for hour near the distribution site on thursday , he saw the eight truck coming . and along with the crowd , he ran towards them . suddenly , when the chaos erupted , he just started seeing people dropping to the ground . he ’ s actually deaf and mute . so he didn ’ t know what wa happening . he just saw people get shot and fall to the ground in front of him . she told me that he saw someone get shot in the head right next to him . god . in the middle of all the chaos and the bloodshed , he wa actually able to grab a bag of flour . he just took it and started running really fast . he wa just trying to get away and hold on to that bag of flour that he wa able to get . while leaving the site , he saw this little kid who wa also able to grab a bag of flour . but she said that he told her that the kid wa stopped by local gang member who had attacked him and grabbed the bag of flour from him . they stole it from him . ghada ’ s brother just kept running until he got home , finally . he came home after three day of sleeping in the sand with a bag of flour . god , a terrifying night . mhm . but that wa the first time they ’ ve had flour in month , since december , basically . so obviously , they wanted to make bread . but that bag wa a 25 kilogram bag of flour . again , they were 50 people sheltering in one apartment . so they had to make it last them a long a possible so it could feed all the member of the family . so actually what they ’ re doing now is they ’ re mixing the flour with animal feed still . they ’ re doing one cup of flour with three cup of animal feed to stretch it out for a long a possible . they ’ re making bread with it . wow . she said that it wa better , but still not normal bread . it wa not what they were craving . [ non-english speech ] . they ’ ve been through so much since the war started . they ’ ve seen people killed . they ’ ve seen dead body . they ’ ve been displaced 12 time . they ’ ve lost friend and family member . but she said that now with the hunger and the starvation in the north , it ’ s really the worst thing they ’ ve gone through since the beginning of the war . she said that she ’ s seeing people , kid who are rummaging through trash , trying to find anything to eat . so she said that people were still going back to that same distribution site . she even said that more people were going back on the beach and waiting and camping out and sleeping there , hoping for more aid to come . she also said that her brother , muhammad , wa also going back every day since thursday , hoping to get another bag of flour . because he wa so hungry that he wanted to eat anything , and risking his life for a bag of flour wa worth it . despite the fact that so many people had died on thursday trying to get flour , the fact that some people did come home with a bag of flour , that wa enough for them and others to go back there in hope that more wa going to come .

[ music playing ] here ’ s what else you should know today . on monday , the supreme court ruled that state may not bar former president donald trump from running for another term , rejecting a challenge to trump ’ s eligibility that had threatened to upend the presidential race . the case arose from a challenge brought by colorado voter who cited section iii of the 14th amendment , a provision adopted after the civil war to forbid those who had taken an oath to support the constitution from holding office if they engaged in insurrection . the justice agreed that individual state may not bar candidate from the presidency under that constitutional provision . it wa a unanimous decision that wa largely expected . and a united nation report released on monday found , quote , “ reasonable ground to believe that sexual violence , including rape wa committed in at least three location in israel during the october 7 attack , the nova music festival site , road 232 , and kibbutz re ’ im . ” the expert also said they had found circumstantial evidence that could indicate sexual violence had occurred with a number of victim , mostly woman , who were found fully or partially naked , bound , and shot . in addition , the un group said it had found clear and convincing information , based on firsthand account from released hostage , that sexual violence , including rape , wa inflicted against some woman during their time in captivity in gaza . the report said that the un team had also heard account of sexual violence against palestinian that implicated israeli security force and settler . today ’ s episode wa produced by sydney harper , rachelle bonja , and lynsea garrison . it wa edited by liz o . baylen and lisa chow . contains original music by dan powell , marion lozano , and elisheba ittoop and wa engineered by alyssa moxley . our theme music is by jim brunberg and ben landsverk of wonderly . that ’ s it for “ the ” daily . i ’ m sabrina tavernise . see you tomorrow . transcript this transcript wa created using speech recognition software . while it ha been reviewed by human transcriber , it may contain error . please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcript @ nytimes.com with any question . from “ the new york time , ” i ’ m sabrina tavernise . and this is “ the daily . ” late last week , an effort to get food into northern gaza turned deadly , a thousand of desperate gazans descended on aid truck and israeli troop tasked with guarding those truck opened fire . but exactly how people died and who wa responsible remains contested . today , my colleague hiba yazbek on what we know about what happened and what it tell u about hunger in gaza . it ’ s tuesday , march 5 . so hiba , we are now in the fifth month of israel ’ s war against hamas in gaza . and for week , we ’ ve been hearing about negotiation over a cease fire and a hostage exchange . then , late last week , there wa a disaster surrounding an aid convoy that wa brought into gaza . you ’ ve been reporting on what happened . tell u about it . so last thursday , there wa a deadly disaster involving civilian , possibly the deadliest disaster since the war started nearly five month ago , in which 118 palestinian were killed and more than 760 were wounded in gaza city . but there are conflicting report on how they died and what exactly happened . the israeli military ha one account of what happened and the gaza health ministry and witness have another account . so my colleague and i started digging into the detail . we started calling people , piecing together a picture of what had actually happened there . and what did you find when you guy started really looking into this ? so first , let me just give you the context of what happened . this happened in northern gaza , the place that ha been at war the longest . that ’ s where israeli ground force began their invasion of the gaza strip . many people have left the north . but we do know that some 300,000 people are still there . the people who have remained there are really living through very desperate condition . very little aid ha come in to the north of gaza since the war started and especially in recent week . food is barely available for the people who ’ ve remained there . the un ha been warning of a famine that is looming over the territory . hiba , why is there so little aid getting into northern gaza in particular ? well , first of all , there ’ s less aid getting into the gaza strip in general , not just the north . there ’ s multiple reason a to why that is . but one of the main reason is that israel itself ha been very slow to approve permit and often denies permit for aid truck and aid convoy to come in , specifically to the north . because israel say that they don ’ t want the aid to end up in the hand of hamas , that they don ’ t want them to get a hold of the package . got it . when israel doe approve the permit and the aid truck start their journey , there ’ s multiple hurdle that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people . some of these hurdle include the widespread destruction in gaza . there ’ s vast damage across the gaza strip . road have been destroyed , there ’ s rubble everywhere , and it ’ s very difficult for the truck to actually move through that rubble and through those road . then these aid convoy have to go through multiple israeli checkpoint on the way . there ’ s often significant delay at these checkpoint by israeli soldier who are inspecting the aid . this make it hard for the truck to make it from where they enter in the south all the way to the north in the specific safety window that they ’ re given . sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they got delayed so much that they can ’ t keep going . hm . but there ’ s a particular problem with the north , where fighting ha been going on the longest . the civil order is now breaking down , essentially . we know that frequent israeli strike on palestinian policeman meant that there ’ s really no one to run security for official group and for aid convoy , leaving them vulnerable to attack by local gang who are trying to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it , and also , hungry and desperate civilian who are trying to grab the aid and take a much a they can , which mean that they end up stealing some of it , looting some of it , while it ’ s still on the way . right . so it ’ s lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown . i mean , this is kind of the downstream effect of extended war in a particular place . there ’ s a power vacuum . that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the united nation to be able to operate safely . right . the few aid truck that do come in have had to either suspend their aid delivery into the north or have not been able to deliver aid there . the last time unrwa , the un agency in charge of palestinian refugee , tried to bring truck to the north wa nearly a month ago . but they said that one of their convoy came under fire . another major aid provider , the world food program , said that they haven ’ t delivered aid there in over three week . they cited all of the reason we talked about for this suspension . so while aid hasn ’ t been coming into the north , people have been growing more desperate and hungry and the situation there ha been getting worse , which ha been raising international alarm . there ’ s been increased call on israel to let aid go through to the north and to alleviate the suffering of the resident there . so israel partnered with these local palestinian businessmen in gaza , and they promised to secure the aid convoy that the businessmen would supply and that would make their way into the north . they successfully did this three time last week . so people started being very hopeful that more would come , and ahead of the fourth delivery , they started to gather at this distribution point right outside of gaza city in the north . that brings u to thursday ’ s incident . [ music playing ] so last thursday around 4:45 am , around 38 aid truck reached this distribution point . they start getting closer to the crowd of people who had camped there overnight waiting for this aid to come . when the people see the truck coming , they ’ re very desperate . they surround them . they get on top of them . then at some point , israeli soldier start firing shot . then it turned violent very fast . it ended with 118 palestinian dead and 760 injured . this is where the account diverge . ok . so let ’ s start with the israeli account . what do they say happened ? so the israeli military said that it wa trying to secure the convoy and it had tank nearby to make sure that the convoy reached the area . it did acknowledge that it troop had opened fire at the crowd , but they said that they opened fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approached their troop and endangered their life . they said the shot that were fired weren ’ t really the reason why so many people died , but the reason that so many people died wa because , in the chaos of all of it , they trampled each other and many had died from suffocation or trampling , and also that the truck had run over some of the people who were trying to run away . oh , god . so the israeli don ’ t deny actually shooting , but they say it wa more about controlling the crowd , kind of a warning shot type thing , and that this wa not the way people actually died . they say the way people actually died wa suffocation or being crushed by the aid truck themselves . right . what did the gazan health authority say ? so the gazan health authority have actually been calling this the flour massacre , or the massacre of the hungry stomach . because what they ’ re saying is that israeli force fired at a crowd of hungry and desperate people who were waiting for aid . witness and palestinian who were there have said that although some people were trampled and possibly run over by the truck , that wa not the main reason for the high death toll . most of the people who were injured or killed were injured and killed by israeli fire . so the gazan health authority are essentially saying this wa a massacre by israel . right . do we know , hiba , what actually did happen ? what have you guy found in your reporting ? well , the israeli military released drone footage that it claimed showed a mass stampede in which gazans are trampled . but that video only added to the confusion of the sequence of event . the quality and the length of the clip made it more difficult to confirm these claim . right . it wa just grainy . there wa no sound . you saw people scramble and run , but you didn ’ t understand why . right . the drone footage wa heavily edited . it left out key moment . but it did show hundred of people circling around the truck and hoping to catch a bag of flour . then suddenly , we see people start to panic and run in multiple direction . then they released another clip in which we see two israeli tank that are positioned about a quarter mile down the road . then we see about a dozen body lying around them . we see people crawling and ducking for cover . [ crowd noise ] but we did have another video that wa released by al jazeera . [ gunfire ] and it showed a crowd near the aid convoy . and it also captured the sound of gunfire and showed multiple tracer round , which is a special type of ammunition that help troop fine tune their targeting when it ’ s d",a deadly aid delivery and growing threat of famine in gaza

[ music playing ] it ’ s thursday , may 23rd . [ music playing ] so , patrick , earlier this week , there wa a pretty surprising announcement by the international criminal court in the hague . it had to do with israel and hamas . tell u what happened . well , on monday morning , we were all taken by surprise by an announcement from the chief prosecutor at the icc , the international criminal court , the top criminal court in the world . it try individual accused of war crime . and the chief prosecutor announced that he wa requesting arrest warrant for five individual involved in the war between israel and hamas for crime against humanity . three of them were from hamas — yahya sinwar , the head of hamas within gaza , the hamas military commander , and the political leader of hamas , who ’ s based in qatar . but maybe the biggest news in this announcement wa that the chief prosecutor wa seeking the arrest of two of israel ’ s top leader — benjamin netanyahu , the prime minister , and yoav gallant , the defense minister . and this wa a massive bombshell . these two men are leader from a major u ally . they ’ re in regular contact with the u government , and they were being implicitly equated with the three top leader of an organization , hamas , that many consider a terrorist organization . and this equation sent shockwaves through israeli society and , indeed , around the world . so this is absolutely remarkable , patrick . i mean , i , for one , wa quite surprised by seeing this . i want to dig into it with you . so who is this prosecutor behind these request for these warrant ? and how did he reach this decision to go for them in the first place ? so the prosecutor ’ s name is karim khan , and he is a british lawyer , a british barrister . he is 54 . he ’ s led a very impressive career . he ha spent year working on human right case , both defending people and also prosecuting in such case . he wa involved in tribunal related to the war surrounding the breakup of the former yugoslavia , rwanda . he investigated islamic state crime in iraq . and in 2021 , he is appointed the top prosecutor at the icc . and what are his responsibility a top prosecutor ? well , it ’ s his job to travel the world and investigate allegation of human right abuse , war crime , crime against humanity , and in the process , play a key role in deciding who get prosecuted at the international criminal court . the icc and the icc prosecutor investigates and try people who would not be pursued by the judicial system within their country of origin . it step in when it seems like the domestic authority in any given country are not doing their job . and last year , he famously went after president putin in russia in connection with the war in ukraine . so at what point did this prosecutor , karim khan , turn his attention to israel and gaza ? well , he actually inherits an investigation from his predecessor that ’ s looking at israel ’ s conduct and also that of hamas during a previous war in 2014 between the two side . but then that get superseded on october 7th by the horror that we saw that day committed by hamas and then by the scale and damage caused by israel ’ s bombing campaign in it counterattack . and we begin to see not only revulsion and horror at what hamas had done in early october , but also growing criticism and condemnation of what israel and it air force did in it response . you ’ ll remember that earlier this year , the international court of justice , a separate court also in the hague , began to address claim that israel wa and is committing a genocide in gaza , a claim that israel strongly denies . right . that wa the case that south africa brought . we did an episode about that . yes , exactly . so a the world ’ s attention focus on this new conflict , so doe karim khan ’ s . also today , the international criminal court ’ s chief prosecutor , karim khan , qc , ha wrapped up a visit to israel and the occupied west bank . khan ha visited the region to investigate if war crime were committed on october 7th . we start to see him arrive in israel visiting some of the site that hamas attacked last year , talking to survivor , talking to leader , reviewing security camera footage , and so on . i have just come from the border of the rafah crossing , and we could see gaza , at least we could see crane that were on the territory of gaza . and he also visited the rafah crossing between egypt and gaza , talk to palestinian . at the ministry of justice in ramallah , the chief prosecutor of the world ’ s highest court . he go to the israeli occupied west bank , to ramallah , where the palestinian authority is based , building up evidence that led to this announcement on monday . [ music playing ] today , i ’ m filing application for warrant of arrest before pre-trial chamber i of the international criminal court . and he make this very dramatic announcement in a video . my office ha diligently collected evidence and interviewed survivor and eyewitness at the scene of at least six major attack location . flanked on each side by two of his deputy . i have reasonable ground to believe that three senior leader of hamas , yahya sinwar , mohammed deif and ismail haniyeh , bear criminal responsibility for the following international crime . and the accusation that he make against the three hamas leader focus on the violent action that hamas took on october 7th . extermination a a crime against humanity . murder a a crime against humanity . and he walked through a long list of charge stemming from the extraordinary violence during that attack . the taking of hostage a a war crime . rape and other act of sexual violence during captivity . and he say there are reasonable ground to believe that hostage taken from israel have been subject to sexual violence , including rape , while being held in captivity . and he cite assessment of medical record , video , and documentary evidence , a well a interview with victim and survivor . and i repeat and underline my call for the immediate release of all hostage taken from israel and for their immediate safe return to their family . so this prosecutor see the atrocity on october 7th and then what followed with hamas taking the hostage , abusing them , a crime against humanity . that ’ s what it amounted to in his view ? exactly . and what about the charge against the israeli ? these are slightly different . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and minister of defense yoav gallant bear criminal responsibility for the following international crime . obviously , a lot of the outcry and horror at the war in gaza ha centered around israel ’ s airstrikes that have killed ten of thousand of gazans . but karim khan focus not on the military action of benjamin netanyahu and yoav gallant , his defense minister , but on the accusation of — starvation of civilian a a method of warfare . — starvation . the idea that israel ha allegedly sought to restrict and block aid delivery , food supply to gaza with the intent to starve the civilian population there . these individual , through a common plan , have systematically deprived the civilian population of gaza of object indispensable to human survival . and that ’ s primarily based on the fact that for the first two week of the war , until october 21st or so , israel blocked all aid entry to gaza after yoav gallant , the defense minister , one of these two israeli whose arrest mr . khan seek , said that he wa imposing a total siege on gaza — no food , no fuel , no electricity . and while that total siege wa eased towards the end of october , khan also note that there have been continuing restriction on essential supply , like food and medicine , ever since . that conduct took place alongside attack that killed civilian , the obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian organization , and attack on aid worker that forced many of those same humanitarian organization to either cease operation or limit their life-saving effort in gaza . the implication is that the famine that he say is present in some area of gaza and imminent in other area is in part the responsibility of netanyahu and gallant . that starvation ha caused and continues to cause death , malnutrition , dehydration , and profound suffering among the population . my office charge netanyahu and gallant a co-perpetrators and a superior in the commission of these alleged crime . why is the focus of these charge starvation ? i mean , given that the airstrikes , a you say , were in many way really the focus of this war and certainly the focus of the world ’ s attention on this war , the civilian death from the military operation . why starvation ? karim khan doe not explain why he focus on starvation rather than israel ’ s military tactic , which he mention only in passing . but legal expert have said that it ’ s easier to prove that starvation wa used a a method of warfare than it is to prove that there have been any specific crime involved in any specific airstrikes . and that ’ s because under the rule of war and international law , it ’ s not necessarily illegal in and of itself to kill civilian during wartime . if a military assesses , with the help of military lawyer , that the likely civilian death toll caused by that strike is proportional to the value of the military target , then that , in many case , will be in accordance with the rule of war . if a military can prove that sense of proportionality , then it ’ s actually quite hard to prove that there wa any crime committed in the process . so in other word , military action are often weighed quite carefully . in the case of , say , a modern military like israel ’ s or the united state , there are lawyer that look at these thing . it ’ s not necessarily so easy to prove that something wa disproportionate and should be considered a crime . exactly . whereas with the crime of starvation , legal expert say that it ’ s potentially easier to prove that there wa some wrongdoing there because yoav gallant , the israeli defense minister , went on record in a public statement , and he announced that there would be a total siege on the territory of gaza . and that wa followed by an action , the action of closing off gaza ’ s border for the next two week , and no aid wa allowed in . during that time , there were restriction on electricity , water , fuel , a well a food . and that ’ s why legal expert think that karim khan ha gone after israel with the crime of starvation rather than focusing on their military operation . but i suppose just thinking about our coverage , patrick , and the conversation you and i have had , famine and starvation and a civilian population in extreme distress trapped in a small piece of territory is also not a small thing , right ? that is also something that make sense that the court would be considering . absolutely , it ’ s a huge thing . people don ’ t have to be hit by an airstrike to be living through an absolutely catastrophic situation . so these charge really seem to spell bad news for israel and for these two israeli leader , netanyahu and gallant . and it ’ s remarkable because these are men who , a you say , are some of america ’ s closest ally . i mean , they ’ re , you know , at the pentagon . they ’ re having meeting with president biden . and now , the chief prosecutor of the icc is saying that they are war criminal . yes , it is a very dramatic moment in the view of some people , a turning point , and certainly , we can say that it is one of the harshest rebuke of israel ’ s wartime conduct since october 7th . [ music playing ] but within israel , there ’ s been a very different reaction . and it ’ s not all bad news for benjamin netanyahu . [ music playing ] we ’ ll be right back . [ music playing ] so , patrick , what do israeli make of this announcement ? within israel , the reaction ha been very different . whether it ’ s netanyahu ’ s ally or his critic , there ha been almost uniform outrage that the prosecutor for the icc would make these accusation . and it mean that at a time of rising domestic criticism of prime minister netanyahu across the political spectrum , with only a very few exception , everyone ha rallied behind netanyahu and gallant . despite the fact that netanyahu is increasingly unpopular and even within his own government , there have been growing criticism of his wartime strategy . for example , just two day before the prosecutor ’ s announcement , one of the senior member of his own wartime cabinet , benny gantz , issued netanyahu with an ultimatum , warning him that he would quit the government if he did not spell out a plan for a post-war gaza . then , suddenly , the announcement come from karim khan that netanyahu and gallant are under investigation . and gantz is one of the first to come out with a condemnation of karim khan and a defense of the israeli government . that is the clearest example of how even critic of netanyahu have fallen in line , circled the wagon , and presented a united front . this is really interesting . so this action by the prosecutor ha kind of had the effect of actually closing division that were starting to appear in israeli society , effectively bringing netanyahu ’ s critic kind of back into his camp , or at least making it harder to criticize him . exactly . and israeli , in general , feel that israel ha always been targeted unfairly , held to a higher standard than many other country , and that this is , once again , another example of that , another example of israel being accused of thing that other country do but get away with . and there have been broadly three criticism from the israeli of the icc prosecutor . first , the israeli claim is that the icc prosecutor is making a horrible false equivalence between hamas , a terrorist organization , and israel , a democratic state . hamas raided israel and launched the bloodiest attack on jew in a single day since the holocaust . israel , in the eye of israeli , is fighting a righteous response to protect their citizen and to win back the liberty of the hostage that were captured on october 7th . [ music playing ] this guy is out to demonize israel . he ’ s doing a hit job . and netanyahu himself articulated some of the clearest version of this argument when he went on american television . he ’ s creating false symmetry , false fact , and he ’ s doing a grave injustice to the international court . and he called khan ’ s decision absurd , an effort to demonize israel and to hold it to far higher standard than any other country . he said it would have been a if after 9/11 — that ’ s like saying after 9/11 , well , i ’ m issuing arrest warrant for george bush , but also for bin laden . — arrest warrant had been issued for both osama bin laden and george bush . or after , in world war ii , well , i ’ m issuing arrest warrant for fdr , but also for hitler . it ’ s a hit job . it ’ s not serious . he ’ s out to defame israel , and he ’ s also pouring gasoline — [ music playing ] the second criticism from israeli ha been about process . the icc wa created about two decade ago by a treaty . more than 120 country have signed that treaty , but israel ha not . and israel contends that the prosecutor doesn ’ t have the authority , therefore , to go after israeli political leader . israeli also say that khan didn ’ t spend enough time assessing whether israel wa itself investigating these allegation within it own judicial system . remember that the icc is a court of last resort . it ’ s only supposed to intervene when a domestic judicial system is genuinely not making any effort to investigate the alleged crime . and israeli are saying that khan didn ’ t spend enough time investigating gallant and netanyahu . the icc prosecutor have spent 10 year investigating alleged crime committed during a previous war between israel and hamas , but this decision ha been issued within just a few month . and israeli are saying that khan jumped the gun in that sense . so the israeli are saying , look , we ’ re trying to get to it , but you just didn ’ t give u enough time . exactly . and they ’ ve even said that khan ’ s team wa supposed to be coming this very week to continue that conversation and assess whether israel wa genuinely looking into these allegation by itself . and that they misled israel by pretending that they would be making that assessment when , in fact , all along they were planning to request arrest warrant . interesting . so for israeli official , they ’ re seeing it a a kind of activist thing , a opposed to a neutral judicial decision . that ’ s their claim , at least . the prosecutor ’ s office say that they have tried to sincerely engage with israel on this issue , but that it ’ s become clear to them that israel doe not seriously investigate this kind of crime . so you said , there are three element to this . what ’ s the last ? the third and last element is on the content of the claim itself . israel flatly denies that it is responsible for the humanitarian crisis in gaza . it even denies that there is a famine or that the situation is on the point of a famine . it point out all the way in which it ha worked to get much more aid into gaza since october , including opening more crossing , allowing the u to create a pier on the shoreline of gaza . it ’ s allowed some country to airdrop aid . and certainly , the amount of aid that ha gone in recent month ha dwarfed the amount that wa going in october and november . and while it accepts that it soldier have obstructed and , at time , even killed aid worker , it say that that obscures the fact that it coordinate every day in detail with aid group to facilitate thousand of aid mission every month . isn ’ t israel ’ s argument that these shipment could also include thing that could be very useful for hamas , the group that just killed 1,200 of it citizen ? exactly . no one ’ s disputing , least of all israel , that israeli official are examining all the aid going into gaza . the dispute is about whether that ’ s necessary . israel say it is . it say that if it didn ’ t check , then some of these aid convoy might be smuggling in weapon or material that could be used to fight israel , to kill israeli civilian . and that , therefore , israel ha no choice but to examine some of these good going in . again , the counterargument is that israel ’ s check are far more stringent than they need to be and end up preventing the entry of everyday item that pose no military threat . ok , so that ’ s the israeli perspective . how doe the united state see the prosecutor ’ s request here ? i mean , the u , obviously , israel ’ s biggest ally . well , the american president , president biden , condemned it in no uncertain term . he said the prosecutor ’ s decision wa outrageous . and he condemned him for drawing an implicit equivalence between hamas and the leader of the state of israel . and why did biden come out so strongly against the prosecutor ? we know that humanitarian aid ha been a major concern for this administration . so why would biden be so opposed to something that really is calling out israel for this aid ? first of all , because israel is a major ally of the united state , and the united state want to show support for it ally . second of all , they fear that this kind of criticism , this kind of intervention , will actually make israel less , rather than more , likely to bring the war to a halt , because the feeling is that it will make israel more defensive and in turn batten down the hatch . the third reason is that the united state , historically , ha never been a particular fan of the international criminal court . we mentioned earlier that israel did not sign the treaty that created the icc . well , the united state did not do that either . and that ’ s in part because american leader fear that having an international global court undermines american sovereignty . they think it ’ s the role of the american judicial system to investigate american citizen . and there is a fear that with the united state so active militarily in many part of the world , that membership of the court , involvement in the court could pave the way for american soldier being tried for acting on behalf of the united state . and that could somehow dent american foreign policy goal across the world . ok , so the united state doesn ’ t really like this court , you know , ha troop in a lot of place , doesn ’ t want a court swooping in and prosecuting them when something go wrong . but i guess the question then , in my mind , patrick , is doe what this prosecutor is doing matter ? i mean , america is not a signatory . israel is not a signatory . so why is this important ? well , for the time being , it meaning is more symbolic than anything else . first , karim khan ha not issued an arrest warrant . he ha requested an arrest warrant for these five people . and three judge will now spend week and possibly month deciding whether to uphold those request . that process can be less than a month . in the case of vladimir putin , it wa just shy of a month . president bashir of sudan wa issued with a warrant . that process took roughly a year . when and if they do do that , however , there will be practical effect . if an arrest warrant is issued , it mean that any country that ’ s a member of the international criminal court , in theory , should arrest any of these individual if they enter their territory . that includes more than 120 country all over the world , much of europe , latin america , africa , and so on . yes , it ’ s true that the united state and israel are not signatory , and neither are turkey or qatar , two of the country where hamas official spend much of their time when they ’ re outside gaza . so there will still be place for official on either side of these accusation to travel to . but there are lot of other country , like france , italy , both place where benjamin netanyahu traveled in the past year , where , in theory , they will not be able to set foot . so the negotiation over the war can still continue , but if netanyahu travel to france or to italy , he could be arrested , which is pretty wild . yes , at least that ’ s the theory . the national authority in any given country still have to make a choice about whether they want to follow through with it . but would those country perhaps not arrest him out of deference to the united state ? i think the expectation is that if we got into this scenario , then someone like netanyahu simply just wouldn ’ t travel to such a country . but the truth is , we just don ’ t really know . we are entering unchartered water . so this is really isolating netanyahu in the world . should it go forward ? yes , isolating netanyahu and to some extent israel itself . and it ha not just practical implication for the physical movement of netanyahu and his defense minister , gallant , but it also compound israel ’ s relationship with foreign ally . it complicates israel ’ s ability to arm itself . more country may grow more unwilling to sell israel arm , or at least they ’ ll face growing pressure because of this decision not to do so . and it also could force the country to become ever more reliant on the united state a it becomes more of a pariah over it action in gaza . which , of course , put the united state in an even trickier position with an ally who ’ s been pretty hard to be friend with of late . right . and in truth , while the practical consequence of this move are still unknown , they do , in general , compound the sense that israel is facing more and more diplomatic consequence for it action . more than a decade ago , a former israeli prime minister warned that israel would face what he called a diplomatic tsunami if it conflict with the palestinian went unresolved . [ music playing ] and it ’ s possible that year later we ’ re starting to finally see what he meant . israel doe still have it supporter , many of them , but we ’ re also now seeing during this war a level of criticism that go above and beyond the kind that we ’ ve grown used to seeing directed at israel over the year . [ music playing ] in addition to the warrant request we ’ ve seen this week , we ’ ve obviously had an extraordinary wave of protest on american campus and elsewhere in the world . and earlier this year , we had a watershed moment when the international court of justice began hearing accusation of genocide against israel . and this week , several european country recognized palestine a a state . wow . so if the tsunami hasn ’ t yet arrived , we can at least say that the wave are getting stronger . [ music playing ] patrick , thank you . thank you . [ music playing ] on wednesday , the leader of spain , norway , and ireland announced that they would recognize an independent palestinian state . the move wa largely symbolic , but raised the concern that if neighboring country followed their lead , europe could become a counterweight to the american position that statehood for palestinian should come only from a negotiated settlement with israel . [ music playing ] we ’ ll be right back . [ music playing ] here ’ s what else you should know today . nikki haley , the former united nation ambassador who dropped her republican presidential bid in march , said on wednesday that she would vote for donald trump but stopped short of officially endorsing him . haley wa trump ’ s longest standing rival in the 2024 primary contest and had carved out an important lane for herself a the voice for voter looking for an alternative to the former president . her decision on whether to endorse him could play a pivotal role in the race . haley ha built a formidable network of high-dollar donor and a solid base of college-educated voter that trump need to win . and the city of uvalde , texas , ha reached a settlement with most of the family of child who were shot by a gunman at robb elementary school in 2022 . to avert a lawsuit , the city promised to overhaul the city ’ s police force , create a permanent memorial to the victim , and pay $ 2 million .
