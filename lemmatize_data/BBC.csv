a the war enters it fifth month - death from hunger ha come to haunt gaza . it is essential to know the when , what and how of the tragedy at al-rashid street . although the precise fact require an independent investigation of a kind not likely in gaza under current condition , that should not distract from trying to answer why people risked their life to gather in the pre-dawn darkness in the middle of a war zone . the refugee were there because they were desperate to feed their family . they died by bullet and trampling - we do not yet know in what proportion - simply because they wanted to live . that is a cruel irony . eighty-five per cent of the population of gaza is now displaced . the war ha dismantled all normal economic activity and food supply . water and electricity supply have been disrupted . hospital struggle without adequate medicine or power . for the last week the un - citing concern over security - ha said it is unable to deliver aid to northern gaza . these are fundamental fact to bear in mind when trying to understand the tragedy . from the outset the international community - expressed in public statement - ha regarded israel a having the primary responsibility for ensuring aid can be delivered safely . but , after month of war there is no sign of what the un call `` an enabling environment `` in which large volume of aid can be delivered to those who need it . it is not a if there ha been absence of evidence of a mounting humanitarian crisis . witness the statement made by the un over several month . `` we are already seeing a cascading collapse in water , sewage , and sanitation service , telecom , food shortage , and healthcare , `` the un 's human right office reported on 15 november . on 2 december , the office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affair reported : `` un humanitarian on monday said that aid team had only ' extremely limited ' movement and access to the north wa `` now entirely blocked . `` twelve day later the un security council adopted resolution 2720 calling on `` the party to the conflict to allow , facilitate and enable the immediate , safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to palestinian civilian throughout that territory . `` on 26 january , the international court of justice ( icj ) required israel `` take immediate and effective measure to enable the provision of urgently needed basic service and humanitarian assistance . `` by 9 february , director of the un relief and welfare agency ( unrwa ) phillipe lazzarini wa accusing israel of blocking food for 1.1 million palestinian in gaza . according to the un , 500 lorry of aid are required each day . the daily average ha been 90 . the aid falling by parachute from the sky in recent day is welcomed on the ground , but it is also a symbol of the failure of the aid effort . there are road leading into gaza from israel and egypt along which lorry carrying huge amount of aid could travel - if those road were safe . the continuing war , and the chaotic condition it ha spawned , mean many lorry driver will not risk their life . civilian looting aid , and criminal gang stealing aid to sell , are part of what one un official termed the `` mogadishu-like `` condition that may be developing - a reference to the chaos that enveloped the somali capital during the civil conflict of the early 1990s . the hamas-run police force in gaza is unwilling to escort aid convoy because it member reportedly fear being shot by the israeli . a for hamas 's leader , having provoked this war they have vanished and are now fighting to survive in the tunnel and ruin of gaza . israel say it is facilitating aid delivery and that , for example , there were three escorted delivery on the night prior to the tragedy at al-rashid street . it ha blamed the un saying aid is stacked up inside the northern border and the un ha n't `` turned up `` to distribute the supply . it is also deeply mistrustful of unrwa - accusing the agency of being infiltrated by hamas . in the wake of the allegation unrwa sacked 12 employee accused of either being involved in the 7 october attack in israel or helping in the detention of hostage . israel 's defence minister yoav gallant said the idf would no longer deal with the agency . `` unrwa ha lost legitimacy , `` he said , `` and can no longer function a a un body . `` at the beginning of the conflict , day after hamas killed more than 1,200 people in israel and kidnapped 250 others , mr gallant ordered a complete blockade of the gaza strip . `` there will be no electricity , no food , no fuel , everything is closed … we are fighting human animal and we are acting accordingly , `` he said . that position changed under u pressure with president joe biden announcing a deal on 19 october under which israel and egypt allowed aid into gaza . some supply began to flow but there were still report of growing hunger . there were repeated entreaty from western politician including uk foreign secretary lord cameron . on 9 january , he said he wa worried israel had `` taken action that might be in breach of international law `` - adding he wanted israel to restore water supply to gaza . a month later - on 12 february - he told the uk 's house of lord that israel had to make sure food , water and shelter were available to people in gaza `` because if they do n't do that , that would be a breach of international humanitarian law `` . in the wake of al-rashid street he called for an urgent investigation . `` this must not happen again , `` he said . but the evidence from many civilian in gaza is they live in constant fear of violent death and - increasingly - starvation . in time the world will ask itself why the un security council , comprising the most powerful nation on earth , did not ensure the delivery of life-saving aid to hundred of thousand of desperate people in gaza . this after nearly eight decade of un humanitarian operation around the world . there is no shortage of experience or resource . addressing the security council a week before al-rashid street incident , secretary general of aid organisation medecins sans frontieres christopher lockyear spoke of a situation where `` the law and the principle we collectively depend on to enable humanitarian assistance are now eroded to the point of becoming meaningless … the humanitarian response in gaza today is an illusion . `` it is still too early to speak of the tragic event of 29 february a a turning point . but , the death of so many in such terrible circumstance have added to the growing pressure for a ceasefire deal that would allow food to reach the hungry . the coming day will tell if those hope can be realised .",pro-palestinian supporter disrupt speech by david lammy

relatability to the futility that drove his action `` , she said . mr bushnell had described himself a an anarchist , once writing that he `` believed in the abolition of all hierarchal power structure `` through legal mean . while based in san antonio with the air force , he wa also active in number of community and mutual aid group and gravitated especially towards helping the homeless , his friend said . in initial volunteer outing , delivering supply like first aid and clothing , mr bushnell wa `` a little shy `` , mr escamilla recalled , but said he soon learned to engage closely with the people he helped . mr escamilla believed mr bushnell felt a tension between his military service and his political belief . he wa still in the military when the israel-gaza war erupted in october last year . some 1,200 people were killed after hamas gunman attacked community in southern israel . they took around 250 hostage back into the gaza strip , with many still alive and being held there . about 1.8 million palestinian have been displaced since israel launched retaliatory military action , which it say is aimed at destroying hamas . while mr bushnell had strong pro-palestinian view and engaged with local activist group , no-one expected that he would end his life in a protest against the war in gaza . aaron bushnell grew up in orleans , massachusetts , in a tightly cloistered religious community known a the community of jesus , according to his friend . a childhood friend , ashley schuman , told the new york time he had told her he left the community in 2019 . mr escamilla said that mr bushnell wa no longer involved in the community of jesus and had distanced himself from his family . some former member of the community of jesus alleged psychological abuse in a 2021 abc news investigation . mr bushnell 's parent , the community of jesus , and a former employer in the community declined to comment to the bbc . in his youth , mr bushnell belonged to a competitive performance group called spirit winter percussion . a group photo from six year ago on his facebook page show the young performer wearing colourful uniform and large grin . `` back then he did n't really talk about much besides sport , music , etc , `` brian spencer , who wa in the percussion group with mr bushnell , told the bbc . `` but he wa a good dude and would always lend a helping hand when needed . `` mr bushnell entered active service on 5 may , 2020 , according the air force . his most recent role wa in cyber defence operation . friend say he left san antonio late last year , and he wa living in ohio before his death . on his linkedin page , mr bushnell wrote he wa seeking opportunity in the u military 's skillbridge program , which allows military personnel to transition into civilian job after their service end . he wa still in the air force at the time of his death . `` we extend our deepest sympathy to the family and friend of senior airman bushnell , `` u air force col . celina noyes said in a statement . at friday 's vigil , there wa an emphasis on remembering the airman a his friend knew him and the cause he believed in , rather than how the world had come to learn his name . before she began her speech on friday , a woman who volunteered with mr bushnell told the crowd : `` you 're going to hear a lot of sad thing . but you 're also going to hear a lot of really good thing . `` because this final , fiery moment wa not the sum of his life . ``",europa conference league : gent and maccabi haifa ordered to play behind closed door - bbc

exorbitant sum for most of gaza 's population . yet increasing number of people are trying to raise the money to flee , with the help of friend and family in the u and europe . among them are the hammads , currently displaced along with more than a million others in rafah next to the egyptian border . their 15-year-old son ibrahim ha down 's syndrome . for him , the israeli bombardment is particularly traumatic . video posted by the family show him shaking in distress after each thunderous boom from nearby airstrikes . his father abed alqader say they have had to resuscitate him three time after he stopped breathing due to severe panic attack . he say ibrahim ha been begging for the family to leave , saying `` please father , i can not continue `` . `` for the last five month , all you hear are sound of bomb , heavy bombing , `` mr hammad added . `` you just sit home and pray you will not be next . `` their online fundraising page , like most , is being managed outside gaza , in their case by another son amjad , who life in europe . it is one fundraiser among thousand , appealing for donor to assist gazans to `` survive `` , `` evacuate `` and `` escape genocide `` . some campaign have been successful , raising over $ 100,000 . however , the bbc spoke to several of these account holder who , even after achieving their fundraising goal , said their desperate attempt to help loved one were mired in chaos and confusion . in the word of one fundraiser , a new jersey woman who asked to remain anonymous to avoid risking the chance of hindering her cousin 's way out : `` every day is a toss-up . `` the first challenge is determining the cost to leave . fundraising account holder who spoke to the bbc said the most common price wa $ 6,000 per person , allowing people to leave within 72 hour . some people fundraise toward the goal of $ 12,000 per person , the price said to get an exit within 24 hour . once enough money is raised , the next challenge becomes getting ten of thousand of dollar into gaza . there are few wire service like western union left in the devastated territory , and the line to enter is days-long . some people have used cryptocurrency exchange . others have relied on paypal account registered elsewhere , a the firm doe n't provide service to people in gaza or the occupied west bank . most people , however , wire the money to someone outside of gaza - a relative or friend in europe - who then withdraws the cash , and travel to egypt to wait in a separate days-long line at the office of hala travel in cairo , an agency that facilitates travel between egypt and gaza . footage from outside the hala office show crowd thronging the street . hala ha not responded to request for comment from the bbc . however , the bbc ha obtained a copy of a receipt from hala travel dated 13 february for $ 6,000 . the person 's name on that receipt also appears with four others on a separate ticket indicating they have been cleared for entry into egypt . visa and onward travel to cairo are included . the final step is to check for approval online . place like the gaza ministry of foreign affair facebook account publish daily list of up to 250 approved name . all have paid thousand to get out , according to the person who provided the receipt , who asked to remain anonymous . people whose name appear on the official list must leave the same day . however , due to spotty wifi service and rolling blackout , some people miss their window to exit and have to repeat the entire process , including paying again , this person say . the man who provided the hala receipt told the bbc that the name of those on the official list to enter egypt only appear after they 've been vetted by egyptian intelligence . `` is this new ? no . it 's not really new , but the price before the war wa $ 600 . now it 's 10 time higher , `` he say . `` gaza is not only under bombardment , but people are profiting from their suffering . `` hamas , the palestinian group which wa governing gaza and launched the attack targeting civilian in southern israel that triggered the current war , ha also accused `` company , individual and people with influence `` of exploiting gazans by `` making them pay exorbitant amount to coordinate their travel `` . egypt 's foreign minister sameh shoukry ha told sky news that his country is investigating . we will take whatever measure that we need so a to restrict it and eliminate it immediately , `` he said , without giving further detail . in january , egypt 's state information service head diaa rashwan `` categorically denied the allegation related to the collection of additional fee from traveller from gaza , a well a claim that an unofficial entity collected fee for the passage to egyptian land `` . egypt wa trying to help gaza 's palestinian , he added , and did not want to impose extra burden on them . much of the crowdfunding is being led by friend and relative who live abroad and have looked on helplessly a israeli bombardment kill whole family and reduces neighbourhood to rubble . `` it 's heartbreaking to watch , `` say shahd , a woman in the u state of virginia who asked only to go by her first name . she helped organise a campaign for her friend , two brother , whom she met on tiktok in 2021 . her own relative in gaza were killed in october , she say . shahd felt compelled to aid her friend after witnessing their narrow escape from death -

2024-03-03T01:25:02.000Z,BBC,"the division playing out in demonstration on british street are also playing out in all our life - and increasingly in the cultural world too . with antisemitism and islamophobia rising , word and action really matter , but from the pavement to the playground to the playhouse , the israel-gaza conflict is polarising opinion - and protest have spilled into the cultural world , with some inevitable backlash . there have been high-profile example of cultural figure venturing into the political arena and taking a stance on what 's unfolding . charlotte church sang the controversial pro-palestinian chant `` from the river to the sea `` at a concert . ( she denied she wa antisemitic ) . the comedian paul currie pulled out a palestinian flag after his show ended at london 's soho theatre and told jewish audience member who did n't stand up to `` get out `` . ( the theatre apologised and said it would n't be inviting currie back ) . and belfast rapper kneecap recently appeared on the late late show in ireland wearing pro-palestinian outfit . ( they apparently flouted rule set by the broadcaster ) . how is what 's happening in the middle east - and the tension being driven here by war and violence there - impacting the uk 's art and entertainment sphere ? what role doe culture have to heal political divide - or foment them ? they 're question i wanted to explore with figure working in that world , to understand where culture fit at a time that emotion are running understandably high . artist speaking up for cause they believe in is n't new . dame vanessa redgrave is almost a renowned for her political view a her acting talent . it 's hardly surprising there are people who want to protest about what 's happening in gaza . the cultural world contains a lot of left-leaning voice . we 've also seen ( so far resisted ) call for israel to be banned from having a pavilion at the venice biennale and from competing in the eurovision song contest . dame helen mirren and boy george were amongst the artist to sign an open letter in favour of israel taking part in what they called `` unifying event such a singing competition `` . they argued the contest is a crucial way `` to help bridge our cultural divide and unite people of all background `` . talking more broadly , the theatre director iqbal khan , associate director at the birmingham rep , say `` the nuance in these issue is being destroyed `` . he call the polarisation across all form of public life `` really concerning `` , describing `` a constant requirement to attach yourself to metaphorical flag and tribe of opinion which do n't represent the truth of thing . `` david baddiel raised the issue of tribalism on the bbc 's today programme last week . the comedian , writer and broadcaster said `` within the space i come from - culture , showbusiness , artist , whatever - it feel there is a lot of support for palestinian and it may feel that the jewish voice is n't able to be heard and cowers a bit at the moment `` . he added that baroness warsi , the former conservative deputy chairwoman and his co-host on a new podcast , had told him muslim feel similarly excluded and silenced in the world of politics and government . many would point to lee anderson 's comment about `` islamist `` controlling the london mayor a evidence of that . the actress and writer tracy-ann oberman told me that `` for those of u that have lived with israeli and with middle eastern politics for a very long time , who 've worked in advocacy between palestinian and israeli and who really understand the geopolitics of the region , we look at people who seem to have suddenly been educated at the university of tiktok to understand the situation - which is of course far too complex to be broken down in a 60-second video `` . she add that `` we 're in shock because of what they 're allowing themselves to say and to be part of `` . each night , more horror unfolds in gaza , with grim milestone passed and devastating image beamed into our home . the conflict wa sparked by horrific act of murder and rape carried out in israel by hamas on 7 october , and the ongoing trauma of the hostage held in gaza . the actor khalid abdalla , who play dodi fayed in the crown , say `` what is very hard is to find a voice which can speak in a way that honour the fact that there is grief and immense legacy on both side `` . but with no political solution , no ceasefire , and `` this scale of slaughter , what 's left for people other than to protest ? and if they have a platform culturally , to use it `` . it 's `` very charged territory `` but there is `` a moral imperative to take a stand `` . the tension in the middle east can have real world consequence in the uk , not just in racist attack on the street . tracy-ann oberman 's timely reimagining of shakespeare 's the merchant of venice is her attempt to `` reclaim `` a difficult play full of antisemitic trope . she wanted people to `` see on stage what anti-jewish hatred look like `` . she is a vocal antisemitism campaigner - often `` the lone voice in a room with so-called progressive creatives `` she say . she told me she now ha personal security a well a security guard who patrol the theatre a she performs her play the merchant of venice 1936 . `` you 've got a jewish actress who ha to have security in the west end because of speaking out about the rape on 7 october and the industry ha not risen up and said ' that 's wrong ' . `` `` there should be more people who are saying ' this is unacceptable ' . they would find it unacceptable if this wa happening to any other minority `` . `` the country should take this very seriously . a history ha proven , what start with the jew doe n't end with the jew `` . clearly , a line is breached if - in these inflamed time - people feel unsafe . khan say `` the right of an artist to show solidarity with people who are suffering should be absolutely honoured . the minute though somebody 's safety is threatened , that 's different `` . he us what happened at the soho theatre comedy show a an example of that . `` everybody in that cultural space should feel safe . and i 'm not sure in the soho instance that happened `` . ( soho theatre is still investigating what happened but said while it robustly supported the right of artist to express a wide range of view in their show , `` intimidation of audience member , act of antisemitism or any other form of racism will not be tolerated `` . ) khan say while `` vigorous debate `` is useful , people `` need to talk without encroaching on another 's safety or inciting others to violence `` . he belief there is `` enormous support culturally for those who oppose antisemitism `` . there is also `` massive disgust at what is going on in gaza at the moment , with obviously the understanding that the atrocity that began all of this wa the particular set of event on 7 october `` . `` the response feel appalling to a lot of people … that 's the thing that 's motivating those voice . `` i wa horrified at what happened on 7 october . but the continuing response and the amount , i would describe it a a genocide . `` the cultural space being used a a vehicle for activism is n't new . art never operates in a vacuum . think back to 1985 when spitting image broadcast a satirical song , released for sale the following year , called `` i 've never met a nice south african `` . it wa an attack on that country 's apartheid regime and wa comedic and pretty uncontroversial . fast forward to 2022 and the baftas took place soon after russia 's full-scale invasion of ukraine . star of the film world including benedict cumberbatch turned up wearing blue and yellow badge in support , and the ukraine flag wa projected onto the side of the royal albert hall . then , last summer , liverpool hosted eurovision on behalf of ukraine - in a sun-filled , joyful coming together of culture . but these geopolitical issue are viewed a binary , for the vast majority in the uk anyway . apartheid wa wrong and the invasion of ukraine is unjust - that 's the prevailing western narrative , and nobody is taking to the street or our tv screen to say otherwise . those artist picked a side and were lauded for it . the israel-gaza war is also binary for many , with more than 30,000 killed in gaza and about 1,200 killed in israel . but perhaps that leaf no room for nuance or an understanding that jew in britain are n't representative of the israeli state , just a british muslim do n't speak for hamas - and that there is genuine fear in our minority community a tension rise . oberman say `` a lot of people do n't seem to understand you can both be heartbroken at the situation in gaza and be appalled at the rise in antisemitism in the uk - the two are not mutually exclusive `` . so where doe all this leave that hard won right to freedom of expression ? she argues `` it 's sacrosanct but it doe n't seem to be working for the jewish community at the moment `` . abdalla say `` either we believe in freedom of expression or we do n't … artist and worker in culture generally have a responsibility to find way to express whatever is culturally important to their age `` . he belief the cultural arena `` ha to be a safe space for difficult conversation . the failure in public discourse ha fed this crisis and we have a duty to confront that . `` `` we need our artist , our cultural worker to be finding a way through , to find a language that can speak a way through , a part of finding a political solution . ``",israel-gaza war : world food programme stop delivery to northern gaza

an emergency radio service for the territory set up in response to the conflict - that package of aid dropped on friday consisted of some legume and a few woman 's health essential . another man , abu youssef , said he wa not able to get some aid that wa dropped near al-shifa hospital in gaza city . `` suddenly , when we were looking up into the sky , we saw aid parachute . so we remained in the place [ where we were ] until the aid landed about 500 metre away from u . there were many people , but the aid wa little , and so we could not get anything . `` mr mokbel said not enough aid wa dropped to meet the basic need of the large number of people in the area . `` thousand of citizen saw the aid falling on them . . . and when hundred or thousand wait in such area , only around 10 to 20 people get thing , while the others go back with nothing . unfortunately , this method of dropping through air is not the most suitable way to transport aid to the north district of gaza , `` he added . `` gaza need a land and water pathway to deliver the aid instead of [ doing it in ] such a manner , which doe n't meet the need of all citizen . `` initially employed during world war two to supply isolated troop on the ground , airdrop have evolved into a valuable tool for delivering humanitarian aid , with the un first using them in 1973 . however , they are considered a `` last resort `` , only to be used `` when more effective option fail `` , a the wfp said in a 2021 report . south sudan is the last place where the wfp carried out airdrop . `` airdrop are expensive , haphazard and usually lead to the wrong people getting the aid , `` jan egeland , the secretary general of the norwegian refugee council and a former un aid chief , told the bbc after returning from a recent three-day visit to gaza . airdrop are seven time more expensive compared to ground-delivered aid due to cost related to aircraft , fuel and personnel , say the wfp . in addition to that , only relatively small quantity can be delivered with each flight , in comparison to what a convoy of lorry can bring in , and significant ground co-ordination is required within the delivery zone , say the wfp . the international committee of the red cross also stress the importance of controlling distribution to prevent people from risking their life by consuming inappropriate or unsafe item . `` delivering sudden and unsupervised type of food to people who are malnourished or even starving can pose serious risk to life . these risk need to be weighed against delivering nothing by air , or the delay a ground distribution may incur , `` the organisation warned in a 2016 report published when aid wa being airdropped into syria during the country 's civil war . airdrop can be carried out from different altitude , ranging from about 300m to 5,600m ( 985-18,370ft ) in conflict zone , and so ensuring robust packaging is crucial to make sure parcel can endure impact with the ground , the wfp add . according to the agency , drop zone should ideally be large , open area no smaller than a football field , which is why delivery have often been aimed at gaza 's coastline . however , this ha sometimes resulted in aid falling into the sea or being carried by the wind into israel , according to local account . gaza resident samir abo sabha told bbc arabic 's gaza lifeline radio that he believed the u should do more and put pressure on it ally israel for a ceasefire . `` a a citizen of gaza , this stuff is of no use , `` he said . `` what we want [ is ] america to pressure israel into a ceasefire and to stop giving israel weapon and missile . `` some aid worker have echoed this sentiment . last week , scott paul of oxfam america wrote on x , formerly twitter : `` instead of indiscriminate airdrop in gaza , the u should cut the flow of weapon to israel that are used in indiscriminate attack , push for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostage , and insist that israel uphold it duty to provide humanitarian aid , access , and other basic service . `` melanie ward of medical aid for palestinian said the u , uk and others should `` ensure that israel immediately open all crossing into gaza for aid and aid worker to assist those in need `` . but a the crisis deepens , others argued that food must be delivered by any mean necessary . `` we need to bring food into gaza any way we can . we should be bringing it by the sea , `` josé andrés , a chef and founder of world central kitchen , which ha been sending food to gaza , told abc news . `` i do n't think we need to be criticising that jordan , america are doing airdrop . if anything , we should be applauding any initiative that brings food into gaza . `` president biden ha vowed that the u will `` redouble our effort to open a maritime corridor , and expand delivery by land `` -

israeli soldier . his account closely match those of two other medic who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal . they told the bbc they were humiliated , beaten , doused with cold water , and forced to kneel in uncomfortable position for hour . they said they were detained for day before being released . the bbc supplied detail of their allegation to the israel defense force ( idf ) . they did not respond directly to question about these account , or deny specific claim of mistreatment . but they denied that medical staff were harmed during their operation . they said that `` any abuse of detainee is contrary to idf order and is therefore strictly prohibited `` . warning : some reader may find detail in this article distressing . the idf raided the hospital in the southern gazan city of khan younis - which wa one of the few in the strip still functioning - on 15 february , saying intelligence indicated that the hospital housed hamas operative . they also said israeli hostage taken by hamas on 7 october had been held there - and some of the hostage themselves have publicly said they were kept at nasser . hamas ha denied that it fighter operate inside medical facility . footage secretly filmed in the hospital on 16 february , the day the medic were detained , wa shared with the bbc . it show a row of men stripped to their underwear in front of the hospital 's emergency building , kneeling with their hand behind their head . medical robe are lying in front of some of them . `` anybody who tried to move his head or make any movement got hit , `` the hospital 's general manager , dr atef al-hout , told the bbc . `` they left them for around two hour in this shameful position . `` the idf told the bbc : `` a a rule , during the arrest process , it is often necessary for terror suspect to hand over their clothes such that their clothes can be searched and to ensure that they are not concealing explosive vest or other weaponry . `` clothes are not immediately returned to the detainee , due to the suspicion they may conceal mean that can be used for hostile purpose ( such a knife ) . detainee are given back their clothes when it 's possible to do so . `` medical staff said that they were then taken into a hospital building , beaten , and then transported to a detention facility , all while undressed . dr abu sabha , the 26-year-old newly qualified doctor and volunteer medic at nasser , described some element of his treatment while in detention a torture , such a making detainee stand for hour without a break . he said other punishment given to detainee included being made to lie on their stomach for prolonged period and delaying their meal . an expert in humanitarian law said the footage and the testimony from the medical staff interviewed by the bbc wa `` extremely concerning `` . he said some of the account provided to the bbc `` very clearly cross over into the category of cruel and inhumane treatment `` . dr lawrence hill-cawthorne , co-director of the centre for international law at the university of bristol , said : `` it go against what ha for a long time been a very fundamental idea in the law that applies in armed conflict , which is that hospital and medical staff are protected . `` `` the fact that they treat national of the enemy side should not in any way undermine their protection , `` he said . the bbc ha been investigating the hospital 's story for several week , speaking to doctor , nurse , pharmacist and displaced people camping in the courtyard . we have cross-checked detail in these account . we were given the name of 49 nasser medical personnel said to have been detained . of those , 26 were named by multiple source , including medic on the ground , the hamas-run health ministry , international group , and the family of those missing . the three medic who say they were detained and later released have not given their account publicly before . they include dr abu sabha , who we interviewed twice . his story remained consistent , and we corroborated key part of his account independently . family of five other medic at the hospital have told the bbc their loved one are missing . in addition , the international committee of the red cross ha confirmed to the bbc that it ha received dozen of phone call from people who say family member , including medic , who were at nasser , are now missing . medic who remained at nasser say the idf 's operation at the hospital left them unable to care for patient . when the idf took control , nearly 200 patient were being treated there , many of them `` bedridden `` , including six inside the icu , according to dr hout , the general manager . those staff allowed to remain have described being ordered to move seriously ill patient between building , being taken away from their duty to be interrogated , and assigned patient whose case they were not trained to deal with , all a they worked in cramped , unsanitary condition . multiple medic said that 13 patient died in the day after israel 's takeover . they said many of those patient had died because of the condition at the hospital , including a lack of electricity , water , and other essential needed to keep nasser running . we can not independently verify this . a doctor shared photo of body in bag on bed that we have confirmed were taken in a ward at the hospital . the idf told the bbc that it had `` provided the hospital with hundred of food ration and an alternative generator that enabled it to continue functioning and treat the patient within it `` . the `` essential system `` of the hospital kept functioning during the idf 's operation on an uninterruptible power supply system , it said . on 18 february , the world health organization ( who ) said the hospital wa short of food and basic medical supply , and had ceased to function . the remaining patient were sent to other hospital around gaza and the medical staff who worked there left shortly afterwards . released detainee and other medic told the bbc that the maternity building , called mubarak , became the place where the idf interrogated and beat staff . dr abu sabha said he wa initially picked to stay with patient after the raid , but wa later taken to mubarak , which he said had become `` more like a torture place `` . `` they put me on a chair and it wa like a gallows , `` he said . `` i heard sound of rope , so i thought i wa going to be executed . `` after that they broke a bottle and it [ the glass ] cut my leg and they left it to bleed . then they started bringing doctor after doctor in and started putting them next to each other . i wa hearing their name and their voice . `` the idf told the bbc it `` doe not and ha not carried out mock execution of detainee , and reject such claim `` . all three of the detainee the bbc spoke to said they were crammed onto military vehicle and beaten a they were transported in a large group . soldier beat them with stick , hose , rifle butt and fist , they said . `` we were naked . just wearing boxer . they piled u on top of each other . and they took u out of gaza , `` one of the medic who wanted to remain anonymous said . `` all along the way we were being hit and sworn at and humiliated . and they poured cold water on u `` . dr abu sabha said that during the journey , soldier took the detainee out of the vehicle . `` they took u to a patch of ground covered in gravel , forced u to kneel down and our eye blind-folded … there wa a pit in the ground , and we thought they would execute u and bury u here . we all started prayer . `` he wa then driven to a building where he and the other detainee with him would be held , he said . the two other released detainee said that at some stage they were given medical check but no medication . one said that instead of getting treatment for an injury , an idf soldier hit him where he wa injured . dr abu sabha told the bbc that detainee were routinely punished for perceived infraction . `` at one point , the blindfold moved down a bit and my hand were handcuffed from behind and i could not fix it . `` they took me out for punishment … i wa standing with my hand raised above my head and my face looking down for three hour . then , he [ a soldier ] asked me to come to him . when i did , he kept hitting my hand until it wa broken . `` later that day , he wa taken to the toilet , beaten , and had muzzled dog set on him , he said . the day after , an israeli doctor fitted him with a cast and then soldier drew a star of david on it , he said . this cast wa later changed by a doctor in gaza and ahmed wa wearing a cast during his interview with the bbc . the bbc confirmed that dr abu sabha had an x-ray and sought treatment for a broken hand at a field hospital in gaza after his detention , and that he arrived there in a cast with a star of david drawn on it . the idf did not address the bbc 's question about dr abu sahba 's cast . none of the three medic were made aware of any specific charge , but two said interrogation focused on whether they had seen hostage or hamas fighter within the hospital . they said they were also asked about their whereabouts on 7 october , when hamas gunman rampaged from gaza into israel and killed about 1,200 people , taking 253 others hostage . more than 130 hostage are still believed to be held by hamas . israeli official have said at least 30 of them are dead . the hamas-run health ministry in gaza say more than 31,000 people have been killed in israel 's retaliatory air strike and it ongoing ground offensive . one of the released detainee said that two day after being interrogated , idf officer told him there wa no evidence and he would be released . `` i asked him , ' who will compensate me for all the beating and humiliation i 've been through , that you did to me , while i knew that i wa n't involved in anything ? ' he started muttering , ' i do n't have anything on you . no charge . ' `` dr abu sabha told the bbc he wa never interrogated during his eight day of detention . the three medic we spoke to say they were transported back to gaza blindfolded after their release . the bbc ha confirmed dr abu sabha 's account that he crossed back into gaza at the israeli-controlled kerem shalom crossing , which is near the southernmost point of the strip where gaza , israel and egypt meet . the medic ' account are at odds with a separate briefing given to the bbc by a senior idf official who said that no arrest were made of medical staff at nasser , `` unless we knew that it wa possible to get this or that intelligence information `` from them . `` we had reasonable ground to assume that they have information , so we took them in for questioning and interrogation , but not beyond that , `` the official said . `` there were no handcuff , we did not take them away for interrogation , nor for advanced arrest , but for the purpose of questioning and trying to obtain information about the hostage or the hamas commander who were in the hospital … a very simple questioning and that 's it . `` some hostage taken from israel on 7 october have described being brought into the nasser hospital complex in an ambulance . one released hostage said her husband - who remains in gaza - wa covered in a sheet to look like a corpse . they have described being kept in small room and being forced to knock if they needed to go to the toilet . one ha described her time in captivity a `` psychological warfare `` . the international committee of the red cross ( icrc ) say that since 7 october , israel ha suspended it detention visit , meaning it ha not been able to visit any detainee . it told the bbc it wa `` deeply concerned `` by the report of arrest and ongoing detention of medic . `` wherever and whoever they may be , detainee need to be treated humanely and with dignity at all time , in accordance of international humanitarian law , `` it said . `` the icrc ha continuously called for , and is ready to immediately resume , detention visit in order to monitor the treatment of detainee and the condition of detention . `` an internal un report seen by the bbc ha described widespread abuse of palestinian who have been captured and interrogated at makeshift israeli detention centre since the war began , which are similar to the account the medic gave . the idf ha previously denied specific allegation in the un report , including the denial of access to water , medical care and bedding . meanwhile , in nasser hospital , a few medic were allowed to stay and care for the remaining patient . some patient had been detained during the raid , according to dr hout , the general manager . in one video provided to u by a nasser eyewitness , idf soldier wheel two hospital bed and the occupant ' hand are hoisted above their head , zip-tied . we have verified it is authentic . in separate footage published by the idf , people can be seen lying on bed in the hospital ground with their hand zip-tied , their arm in a similar raised position . we do not know who these people are , or what happened to them after this footage . the idf said : `` we emphasize that the hand of patient who were not suspected of involvement in terrorism were not tied . `` medic who remained were frightened of being shot if they defied order not to leave the building , dr hatim rabaa , who also worked at nasser , told the bbc in a phone call on 22 february , a explosion sounded in the background . but nevertheless they went down to the yard to collect water , worrying that patient would otherwise die , he said . `` people were dying of thirst . on my shoulder i carried three gallon of water so that i can make people drink . what else could i do ? `` multiple medic said that the idf would not grant them permission to bury or even move the body of patient who died in the aftermath of the operation . the body remained inside with staff and patient a they began to decompose , the medic said . `` the smell filled the whole department , `` dr rabaa said . `` patient were screaming ' please remove them from here ' . i wa telling them ' it is n't in my hand ' . `` dr rabaa wa one of a small group of medic chosen to remain with patient . he said that he too had been stripped to his underwear and made to kneel in front of the emergency department - but he wa then led away to the building where patient were kept . he said he doe not know what happened to his colleague he left behind in the courtyard . the bbc put detailed question about the allegation to the israeli military . in it response , the idf told the bbc that `` about 200 terrorist and suspect of terrorist activity were detained , including some who posed a medical team `` . they said that `` many weapon were found , a well a closed medicine intended for israeli hostage `` . they said they had operated in a `` precise and focused manner , creating minimal damage to the hospital 's ongoing activity , and without harming the patient or the medical staff `` . additional reporting by muath al khatib and by bbc arabic 's marie-jose al azzi and soha ibrahim verification by richard irvine-brown , benedict garman and emma pengelly , bbc verify visual journalism and design by gerry fletcher , lilly huynh and zoe bartholomew",israeli tell british mp of evidence of hamas sexual violence

call for answer from israel . the u state department said israel ha a `` moral responsibility `` to investigate credible report of abuse or violation of humanitarian law . now , through witness

fighter they were aware of . following the raid , the idf said some 200 terror suspect had been detained , including some who had `` posed a medic `` . in the day before the raid , the fear in nasser wa building , and almost everyone we spoke to who wa in the hospital at this time believed idf sniper and drone were targeting people moving between building on the hospital site or standing by window . `` they surrounded the hospital with tank , with bulldozer , quadcopters in the sky , sniper were everywhere , `` said 26-year-old dr mahmoud shammala , an oral and maxillo-facial surgeon . `` we ca

an improvised pulley system to get water to a group of people gathered near the ground of one of the three school located near the hospital . when a man attempt to get across the street , a loud

the majority of them child and woman - have now been killed in gaza since 7 october , the hamas-run health ministry said last month . the actual number of dead is likely to be far higher a the count doe not include those who have not reached hospital , among them thousand of people still lost under the rubble of building hit by israeli air strike . mr netanyahu said on sunday that he could not accept the figure of 30,000 . he said israel 's military had killed 13,000 hamas fighter in gaza and that it estimated the ratio of civilian death to combatant death wa 1 to 1.5 . in his thursday remark , mr schumer said : `` a a democracy , israel ha the right to choose it own leader , and we should let the chip fall where they may . `` but the important thing is that israeli are given a choice . there need to be a fresh debate about the future of israel . `` `` in my opinion , that is best accomplished by holding an election , `` he added . israel is next due to hold a general election by october 2026 . for peace talk to advance , mr schumer said palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , who is based in the occupied west bank , must also step down . the palestinian leader , who is 88 , ha been little seen throughout the conflict and his government ha not held election since 2006 . on wednesday , mr abbas , who ha been under pressure from the u to reform the palestinian authority , appointed his former adviser a prime minister . mr schumer 's comment prompted a rebuke from outgoing republican senate leader mitch mcconnell , who called the 40-minute speech `` grotesque `` and `` unprecedented `` . he said it wa `` hypocritical for american who hyperventilate about foreign interference in our own democracy to call for the removal of a democratically elected leader of israel `` . opinion poll show most israeli support the war , but one survey released in january suggested just 15 % of voter wanted mr netanyahu to remain in office once the conflict end . meanwhile , the u revealed sanction against three more settler and for the first time against two israeli settlement outpost it accused of undermining stability in the occupied west bank . there were nearly 500 israeli settler attack against palestinian between 7 october and 31 january , according to un figure . the vast majority of the international community considers the settlement and outpost illegal under international law , though israel and the u dispute this interpretation .",bournemouth beach child 's clothes protest over israel-gaza war

before the war broke out she wa being treated at the turkish-palestinian friendship hospital in north gaza - the only cancer hospital in the strip . she 's one of approximately 10,000 cancer patient in gaza - according to figure from gaza 's hamas-run health ministry - who have been unable to get treatment or medicine since the hospital shut down in the first week of november due to fuel shortage . like other displaced palestinian in gaza - of which the un estimate there are 1.7 million - siham fled her home in the north when her neighbourhood wa hit by air strike . when we spoke , she wa sheltering with her daughter , who ha a newborn baby , in a school in rafah run by the un agency for palestinian refugee , unrwa . she ha been trying to leave for life-saving treatment for month , but ha been turned away at the rafah border crossing five time since the war began - it is currently the only way out of gaza . all border crossing with gaza were closed for almost four week after hamas attacked israel on 7 october , killing more than 1,200 people and taking 253 others a hostage . israel 's subsequent military campaign in gaza ha killed more than 31,000 palestinian and left more than 73,000 injured , according to the health ministry . in november , egypt reopened the rafah crossing to allow egyptian citizen and other foreign passport holder to leave , a well a seriously injured and sick palestinian . a recent report by gaza 's health ministry said more than 2,600 patient had been evacuated via rafah , comprising 1,700 wounded and 900 sick . egypt , turkey , the uae and jordan have pledged to treat thousand of cancer patient like siham , a well a those injured in the war . a daily list is published by the palestinian border authority with name of the people who have been approved by egypt and israel to leave . siham 's name first appeared on the list published on 19 november for evacuation to turkey . but she wa turned away by border agent when she arrived at the crossing . `` they said the turkish envoy had n't arrived . is our life not a important a the arrival of the turkish envoy ? how is someone supposed to get out ? or is it because we 're not well connected ? `` she said . palestinian border agent said that because the turkish envoy wa not there to receive siham on the egyptian side , they could not let her through . but we have spoken to others who were allowed to travel to turkey that day . mona al-shorafi wa diagnosed with breast cancer three year ago , and had been receiving treatment in jerusalem before 7 october . she had been co-ordinating an initiative to provide psychological support for other cancer survivor and wa just three day away from her next chemotherapy session when the war began . `` we had to leave our home and stay in shelter and school with many other family , and we were very worried because of our weak immune system , `` she said . mona 's name wa on the same evacuation list a siham 's on 19 november . she wa allowed to cross the border to egypt , and boarded a plane to ankara along with more than 130 others , she told u . she wa even allowed to take her two young daughter with her , although each patient is only officially allowed one companion . `` i had decided that if they turned one of my daughter back i would n't cross , i could n't leave them behind , `` said mona . her husband and son are still living in a tent in the tal al-sultan area of rafah . palestinian border authority in gaza did not respond to our question about why siham wa refused permission to leave . we have spoken to two other cancer patient who were turned away at the border despite their name being on the evacuation list . one of them , who did not want to be named , told u he wa also supposed to leave on 19 november , but believed he wa turned away because his companion wa his young son . he said palestinian border authority prefer female companion for evacuee , in order to reduce the chance that those leaving could be hamas fighter . another patient , who wa supposed to be evacuated to the uae for treatment in december , wa told at the border that the official could not find her name . dr sobhi skaik , director of the turkish-palestinian friendship hospital in gaza , told u that out of gaza 's estimated 10,000 cancer patient , `` the name of approximately 3,800 have been given permission to leave gaza for treatment abroad , but in reality only around 600 have left the gaza strip since the start of the war , whether adult or child `` . we have spoken to doctor in gaza , palestinian health ministry official in the occupied west bank , and palestinian diplomat in egypt to better understand the complex evacuation process . a doctor or hospital in gaza nominates the patient in need of the most urgent medical care to the hamas-run health ministry in gaza . those name are then sent to the egyptian authority , who run a security check . once egypt ha approved the list , it is then vetted by the israeli authority , who must also approve the name . when the final list is approved , it is shared with the country who have said they are willing to receive patient and is published online . each group of patient is approved for travel on a specific date . but whether a patient is ultimately allowed to leave is up to the discretion of the palestinian border authority . in response to why more patient were not being allowed through , the israeli ministry of defence told u : `` the rafah crossing is governed by egypt . there is , therefore , no restriction a far a israel is concerned regarding the number of patient that can cross at the rafah crossing to obtain medical treatment outside the gaza strip . `` the egyptian health ministry , the egyptian foreign ministry , and the palestinian border authority declined to answer our question on the evacuation process of patient from gaza . turkey said in early november that it wa willing to take up to 1,000 cancer patient , while the uae announced that it would also take in 1,000 cancer patient and 1,000 injured child . turkish official told u the country wa currently treating several hundred cancer patient and injured from gaza , and it wa willing to receive hundred more . `` if gaza give u a list of 600 people , we do not pick and choose a certain number of those . for u , the more patient and injured people who can be sent , the better . we have the capacity to treat all of them , `` one of them said . but there are other way people are getting out of gaza . the war ha given rise to a lucrative monopoly , with one egyptian travel agency , hala , reported to be charging palestinian $ 5,000 ( £ 3,900 ) per person to leave gaza within one to two week . before the war , it used to charge about $ 350 ( £ 274 ) per person to go from gaza to egypt . after 7 october , the price reportedly rocketed to almost $ 12,000 per person , before the company limited it to $ 5,000 for an adult palestinian and $ 2,500 for a child - though hala doe not officially advertise this . this cost of evacuating one adult is more than four time the average annual salary in gaza . outside hala 's office in cairo , people crowd daily , trying to get a foot through the door . one palestinian man , who did not want to be named , told u he had to pay to enter the company 's office , and made another extra payment of $ 300 to a member of staff at hala to get his family on the evacuation list . this wa in addition to the $ 10,000 he paid to evacuate his wife and two child . we spoke to 10 people who used hala 's service to try to leave gaza who said they had made payment of up to $ 4,000 to employee in order to secure preferential treatment for their family ' evacuation . some of them have left and some are still waiting to leave . the high demand ha also given rise to a secondary market of broker who prey on the desperation of palestinian with family trapped in gaza and claim they can get people to the top of the evacuation list - for a price . one broker in egypt told a woman that she could pay him an extra $ 2,500 to get her family in gaza on the evacuation list . in voice message that she shared with u , the broker say that his contact in hala `` ha to hold the money in his hand `` before he register the name and insists : `` i 'm doing this to help you , i 'm not taking one [ israeli ] shekel even . `` but the best connected in gaza can leave without paying at all . we found the name of palestinian who left gaza posing a egyptian citizen , who told u they were helped to leave gaza by people with political connection , who had added their name to the egyptian citizen ' list . another woman , whose son needed urgent medical care , said people with political connection helped them to get on to a special vip list , which is not published online . she told u that her son 's name `` did not show up on the health ministry 's list . his name wa on another special list `` which wa read out at the border . neither hala nor the egyptian foreign ministry responded to our question about the company 's activity . egypt 's foreign minister sameh shoukry previously told sky news that his country wa investigating . `` we will take whatever measure that we need so a to restrict it and eliminate it immediately , `` he said , without giving further detail . in january , egypt 's state information service head diaa rashwan said it `` categorically denied the allegation related to the collection of additional fee from traveller from gaza , a well a claim that an unofficial entity collected fee for the passage to egyptian land `` . in gaza , time is running out for siham and cancer patient like her , who are caught up in murky regulation and red tape at the border . desperate to get her out , her son saqr told u he tried to arrange for her to be evacuated through the hala company . `` if we had the money we would n't have hesitated . when we asked about a private evacuation they said the minimum hala asks for is $ 5,000 , but we ca n't afford $ 5,000 . `` after her first attempt to cross , siham said she went back to the border four more time to see if they would let her through , a her name had already been approved . but she wa refused by palestinian border authority , and her health is now quickly deteriorating . `` i can hardly walk a step without feeling dizzy now . i do n't know what they 're waiting for , `` she said .",senate advance aid package for ukraine and israel
2024-03-15T06:00:04.000Z,BBC,"the u ha announced sanction against three more israeli settler and - for the first time - two farming outpost , a part of new measure by washington and london to stop the violent displacement of palestinian in the occupied west bank . fare samamreh may not carry a gun , but he ha a global superpower defending him . he 's still losing the fight . a palestinian sheep farmer on the sun-tinged slope of the south hebron hill in the occupied west bank , his battle with his neighbour , an israeli settler called yinon levy , ha drawn both the u and the uk into the dispute . `` yinon levy came here three year ago and started bothering me , `` fare said , his head wrapped in a piece of white cotton , his eye narrowed in a permanent squint against the sun . `` before the war [ in gaza ] it wa the usual thing ; they would come with drone . but a few day after 7 october , it became serious . they all had gun . they started coming to u day and night . i have little kid - some of them are four and five year old . `` fare said yinon wa one of a group of local israeli settler who would regularly come to harass his sheep with their dog and weapon , and even , he say , to assault his family . `` they destroyed water tank , closed down road , they fire at the sheep , `` he said . `` he told my wife if we did n't leave here , we 'd all be killed . `` he said when his wife then swore at him , yinon levy hit her with the butt of his gun . soon afterwards , fare and his family left their village of zanuta . activist say it 's one of four community around the settler 's farm that have been abandoned by their resident . yinon ha denied acting violently towards palestinian in the area - and said he did n't own a gun until very recently . but he 's the subject of sanction from both the u and the uk . the road to yinon 's farm is straight out of a child 's picture-book ; a narrow path that wind back and forth up a steep hill , slope and valley dropping away to the horizon on either side . at the top , a spacious bungalow stand next to a large shed , full of bleating sheep smothering the strain of pop music from a radio . `` we 're safeguarding these land to ensure they remain under jewish ownership , `` yinon said . `` when there is a jewish presence , then there is no arab presence . we keep a watchful eye on the land , ensuring that no unauthorised construction take place . `` most country deem the settlement , which are built on land captured by israel in 1967 in the middle east war , to be illegal under international law , although israel disagrees . the settler outpost are also illegal under israeli law . the uk said that yinon and another man had `` used physical aggression , threatened family at gunpoint , and destroyed property a part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace palestinian community `` . yinon denied the allegation , and said that the israeli government wa on his side . `` i 'm not worried , `` he told the bbc . `` this is not against me personally - it 's against those who obstruct the creation of a palestinian state . there 's no legal process against me [ in israel ] . here , everything is fine . `` both the uk and the u say there is a threshold of evidence that must be met - but neither have made that evidence public and declined to share it with the bbc . we sent yinon a video appearing to show him on palestinian land , approaching activist with a snarling dog . he said it wa misleading , and that he wa defending his flock . we sent him another video apparently showing him entering another palestinian village with a gun last october . he declined to comment . the sanction came after a surge in violence in the west bank , following the 7 october hamas attack and israel 's war in gaza . the un say violence by israeli settler included physical attack and death threat , and that the number of palestinian displaced from their home last year doubled to 1,539 - with more than 80 % of them leaving after 7 october . the uk ha said israel is failing to act , and ha described `` an environment of near total impunity for settler extremist in the west bank `` . yinon said that he had received support from israeli politician . `` many called and encouraged u , `` he said . `` everyone said that when the bad people are against you , you must be doing something right . `` one of the politician who publicly backed yinon in the wake of the sanction wa zvi sukkot of the ultranationalist religious zionism party - a settler himself . he said that settler violence wa a `` marginal phenomenon `` and that those like levy were the victim of conspiracy . `` when we have a functioning judicial system in israel , we do n't want our ally to say , ' we 'll do the job for you ' , `` he said . `` if there wa evidence against yinon levy , he would be in israeli prison . who is britain to come and say , ' we are smarter than israeli intelligence ' ? `` the israeli police commander responsible for investigating complaint in the west bank told mr sukkot 's parliamentary committee this week that half the complaint filed about settler violence there were false , and that they originated from `` radical left-wing organisation in tel aviv `` . against this backdrop , sanction on a handful of individual settler have not shifted israeli policy in the west bank , but they are having a financial impact . yinon 's israeli bank account wa frozen last month . some of those currently under u and uk sanction have used crowdfunding to finance project for their area - including one for a synagogue and educational centre at another hilltop outpost called moshe 's farm . it owner , moshe sharvit , wa sanctioned along with yinon levy last month . but on thursday the u expanded sanction to cover several new target , including the farm itself - putting this kind of funding at risk . these sanction may be more symbolic than substantial , but they signal american displeasure - both to israel 's leader , and to the part of president biden 's democratic base who have been dismayed by image of the war in gaza , in an election year . the chairman of the local yesha ( settler ) council , shlomo ne'eman , called it `` a disgusting phenomenon `` and said the west bank wa being used a a scapegoat . `` i think more than anything , what drive the response of the uk [ and ] the u is the fear of one settler attack that go ' out of control ' , `` said yehuda shaul , founder of the ofek centre , a think tank which campaign to end israel 's occupation . `` the west bank [ then ] erupts like a volcano . and we have another front , a if gaza is not enough , and the road to regional war is almost unstoppable then . `` two sheep farmer in the occupied west bank - one backed by a superpower , the other by the israeli state . if the lifestyle here is simple , the politics are complicated . from yinon 's hilltop farm , you can clearly see the ruin of zanuta perched on the next hill , with the home fare samamreh left month ago . many of the house are ravaged - roof and furniture taken by their owner into exile ; wall smashed by settler to prevent them returning , activist say . the deserted village is slowly being taken over by vast bank of wild mallow . on a post near the entrance , a large star of david ha been scrawled in blue paint . settler here point to attack by palestinian , and say they are scared . but it 's palestinian who are leaving .",lovelock hostage bridge to recognise israeli hostage in gaza

ordinary formula make him sick . she found one tub of non-dairy formula but it wa $ 40 ( £ 31 ) , ten time the price before the war . by mid-january the family were living on a patch of scrubland outside khan younis and amal had only two day of baby formula left . at three month old , mohamed could eat nothing else . `` i 'll dig the mountain to provide it , `` she texted . `` my baby need it . `` she sent her brother to search in the rubble of building but they came back empty-handed . she decided to go to rafah to search the shop and market again . that journey would usually take just 20 minute by car , but israeli force were now active on the route . on the way they encountered three tank ; one fired in their direction with the shot landing near the car . the driver reversed and they escaped . panicked and desperate to get back to her child , she did n't manage to find any formula . fighting in khan younis intensified in february and the noise from the explosion wa especially difficult for noah . he ha epilepsy and the bombing make his seizure worse . his epilepsy medication ha run out and amal ca n't find it anywhere . the family have little food and less water . amal ha been boiling it over the fire to try to get it clean . `` it 's still dirty but i 'm doing my best , `` she said . about 24,000 child have been born since the beginning of this war , according to estimate by the who . gaza 's entire population is facing crisis level of hunger but the risk is especially acute for young child . `` child can get sick very fast , `` say anu nayaran at unicef . they have fewer store of fat and muscle and can slip quickly into acute malnutrition . `` even when they are treated there are long-term consequence . malnutrition can lead to higher rate of diabetes , heart disease and even obesity in later life . a study of adult in the democratic republic of congo , who were treated for severe acute malnutrition a child , found it had a long-term effect on their cognitive development , negatively affecting educational achievement and self-esteem . amal ha given up on finding formula for now . but mohamed would not go hungry , yet . she found a mother in the same area who is breastfeeding him alongside her own baby . amal wa paying her with some baby clothes and a little money . they were camping on a patch of sand in the coastal area of al-mawasi in tent made from plank and rubber sheet , eating canned food and bread from donated flour if they could get it and cooking with foraged wood . al-mawasi had been designated a a `` humanitarian area `` by the israeli military earlier on in the war . even that set-up would not last long . last sunday they were displaced yet again when their camp came under attack . the tent next to amal 's wa shelled and four people were killed . `` it 's a miracle we are alive , `` she texted . like many other gazans she ha now resorted to online crowdfunding to try to raise the thousand of dollar her family will need to pay broker to get on a list of people approved to leave gaza for egypt and safety . one evening amal sent the last picture she took of her life before the war , dated the night of 6 october . noah wa lying on the soft carpet , propped up on a big cushion , watching cartoon on tv and swigging milk from his bottle . he 's kicking his leg in the air under the soft glow of fairy light on the living room wall . he fell asleep tucked up with his mother that night in a world far away from the dust , dirt and brutality that mark their life now . `` i 'm trying to do what is possible , `` said amal . `` i just need to rescue my kid from this horrific war . ``",leeds man sentenced over antisemitic graffiti on m & s shop
2024-03-16T08:03:40.000Z,BBC,"since the start of the israel-gaza war , following the hamas attack of 7 october , the overriding fear ha been that the conflict could spill over into something even deadlier . the day after the hamas assault , lebanon 's most powerful armed group hezbollah fired guided rocket and shell into israel in solidarity with hamas , prompting israeli drone and artillery retaliation . could israel , traumatised and vulnerable , with a prime minister fighting for political survival , decide the threat from across it northern border in lebanon need to be neutralised ? the fear ha been that benjamin netanyahu 's government might be tempted into a second front in the war , against hezbollah - which , like hamas , is intent on destroying the jewish state . and if so , would it draw in iran , hezbollah 's key patron in the region and sworn enemy of the u ? this week israel carried out more air strike on the bekaa valley , deep into lebanon , taking the death toll in lebanon since the start of the conflict to more than 240 . in retaliation , hezbollah fired a barrage of 100 katyusha rocket on northern israel , it heaviest attack since the war began , with target including israeli army base in the golan height . at least 17 israeli have been killed in attack from lebanon and syria since october . the rocket this week prompted an angry post by israel 's far-right national security minister itamar ben-gvir , addressed to the defence minister yoav gallant : `` the military is your responsibility . what are you waiting for ? we have to start responding , attacking - war , now ! `` last month , chief of staff of the israel defence force ( idf ) herzi halevi said : `` we are now focusing on being prepared for war in the north . `` for long , it seemed that the clash on the border were carefully calibrated around unspoken red line to avoid escalation into all-out war . hassan nasrallah , the leader of hezbollah , ha not called for it . memory in lebanon are still fresh of the disastrous 2006 war with israel , which left more than 1,000 lebanese dead . and israel know that hezbollah 's military capability is far greater than that of hamas . a poll published in the country 's maariv newspaper last month showed that 71 % of respondent favoured a large-scale military operation to drive hezbollah back . sarit zehavi life close to the lebanese border and head the alma research centre , which specialises on the threat there . she say hezbollah 's aim is `` to drag israel into war without actually initiating it `` . but , she argues , israel is not looking for all-out confrontation . `` israel 's interest is to avoid full scale war - but achieve an improved security situation , while damaging hezbollah 's brigade a much a possible . for israel , it is about choosing the least worst option : we understand the capability of hezbollah here and the cost of war . `` she belief that hezbollah 's use of rocket , which have a longer range than anti-tank missile used previously by the group , is evidence of a shift in the group 's military tactic and capability . `` hezbollah take into consideration the cost of a war , but they do n't look into the near future - they look year ahead . `` `` they have already gained by forcing the evacuation of ten of thousand of israeli , `` she add - about 60,000 israeli living in community close to the border have fled the fighting since october , the largest such displacement in israeli history . around 100,000 lebanese resident have also been moved from the other side of the border . to allow for the evacuee to return , israel want to push hezbollah 's force back beyond the litani river , which mark a buffer zone of sort between beirut and the israeli border . a part of the agreement to end the 2006 war , the area south of the litani wa supposed to be clear of military presence except for that of the lebanese army and un force - which hezbollah ha violated . that 's been part of discussion with amos hochstein , the u special envoy , who ha been repeatedly dispatched to the region to avert an escalation . but a deal on hezbollah 's withdrawal and disarmament remains elusive . so far , both benjamin netanyahu and hezbollah appear to be holding back from the precipice . the israeli army is already stretched in gaza , without opening a new front - and a new wave of international tension . and hezbollah is in reactive mode , opting more for a lower-level war of attrition . but the real risk is miscalculation , and caving into competing pressure . mr netanyahu is battered by the perception that he left his country vulnerable to the worst attack in it history , reviled by family of the hostage who want him to strike a deal to bring them back , and excoriated by the west over the mounting civilian casualty in gaza . the fear is that he may see expanding the fight in lebanon a key to his political survival - and that israel , in the wake of the 7 october attack , would not countenance the continued threat on it northern front without taking military action . professor hilal khashan , from the american university in beirut , belief israel 's relative restraint so far doe n't tell the true story . `` netanyahu clearly want war , `` he say , pointing to israel 's strike on about 4,000 position across lebanon since october . `` he is finished politically and when the war stop , he will have to face his reckoning , `` he say . `` i do n't think he 'll give a damn about what the u or europe will think - he ha made up his mind on hezbollah . `` a further , and potentially more serious , unknown would be the response from iran , which relies on hezbollah , it proxy in lebanon , a a bulwark against israel . since the hamas attack , tehran ha flexed it muscle across the middle east . iran-backed group have hit u military base in iraq and syria , and yemen 's houthi rebel , aligned with iran , have launched countless strike on ship in the red sea . it ha so far stopped short of an unfettered war . but major israeli strike on hezbollah could change tehran 's calculus . in lebanon , there is little appetite for full conflict with israel , particularly among religious group that do n't belong to the shia branch of islam to which hezbollah belongs . `` non-shias are almost unanimously opposed , and want hezbollah to disarm , `` say professor khashan . but shia are unhappy about the fighting too , he say . `` by and large , they do n't want war either . `` hassan nasrallah ha said that he will not agree to a ceasefire with israel before there is a truce in gaza . he is reported to have told an iranian military leader last month that he did not want iran to get sucked into a war with israel or the united state - and that in the case of a full offensive with israel , hezbollah would fight on it own . still fear stalk those living on either side of a perilous border . `` every night , i take the image of 7 october massacre with me to bed , `` say sarit zehavi , `` and every morning i wake and say ' ok , the terrorist did n't invade again last night ' . it 's an existential threat in the deepest possible way . ``",israel chooses eurovision 2024 entrant amid call for a boycott

afghanistan , about 70 % . so , again , this only underscore both the urgency , the imperative , of making this the priority . `` he once again called on hamas to lay down arm but said it wa incumbent on israel to make it a priority to provide for those who desperately needed humanitarian assistance . asked about the number of journalist killed in gaza and lack of access to the territory for international reporter , mr blinken said that `` a a matter of principle `` journalist should have access wherever there is conflict so `` the world can have knowledge `` . he said the issue wa something `` we bring up in every instance `` . later , the un human right chief stressed that the catastrophic hunger in gaza wa `` human-made and . . . entirely preventable `` . volker türk put the blame firmly on what he called israel 's `` extensive restriction on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid and commercial good , displacement of most of the population , a well a the destruction of crucial civilian infrastructure `` . the restriction , he warned , `` may amount to the use of starvation a a method of war , which is a war crime `` . israel 's diplomatic mission to the un in geneva said mr türk wa seeking to blame it for the situation in gaza and `` completely absolve the responsibility of the un and hamas `` . `` israel is doing everything it can to flood gaza with aid , including by land air and sea , `` it insisted . aid worker reject this , saying that much of the problem in the northern gaza is due to a collapse in security around aid convoy , after israel targeted police who were escorting them . israel ha said police have been hit because it military is dismantling hamas . but the u ha questioned this , saying such targeting make aid distribution impossible and is counterproductive . meanwhile , the u state department ha called on israel to permit philippe lazzarini , chief of the un 's agency for palestinian refugee , entry into gaza after he wa denied on monday . israel previously accused unrwa of supporting hamas , which the agency denied . but in january it sacked nine of 12 employee accused in an israeli document of playing a part in the 7 october attack . u official also announced on tuesday that mr blinken would make his latest trip to the region since hamas 's attack on israel on 7 october and the start of the war in gaza . it come without a breakthrough so far on a ceasefire for hostage-release deal between israel and hamas . he will speak with saudi leader in jeddah and then continue onto cairo to meet the egyptian leadership . a significant part of the talk will focus on arab support for a post-war plan to secure and govern gaza . the american want rule by the palestinian authority , the post-oslo peace accord entity that lost control in gaza to hamas after election and fighting 17 year ago . but the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu ha repeatedly rejected the idea of pa rule there , one of many critical point of dispute over any so-called `` day after plan `` for gaza . mr blinken did not address a question about whether an agreed post-war plan for gaza could only move forward with a different israeli leader . on monday night , u president joe biden told mr netanyahu this his plan to push on with an offensive in rafah would be a `` mistake `` , with more than a million gazan civilian sheltering in the southern border town . in their first conversation in over a month , they also discussed a plan to send an israeli delegation to washington next week to discus both the rafah plan and a new alternative approach to targeting hamas there without a major ground invasion .",eurovision 2024 : israel agrees to october rain lyric change

or insecurity - against five `` phase `` of severity , with famine the fifth and worst . for a famine to be officially declared , three thing need to happen in a specific geographical area : according to the un , famine is imminent in northern gaza , and could occur any time up to may 2024 . it follows month of conflict between israel and hamas in gaza after the 7 october hamas attack on israel . half the population - about 1.1m people - are starving , according to the ipc classification . in the worst-case scenario , the entire population of gaza will be in famine by july 2024 . the un said gaza had the `` highest share of people facing high level of acute food insecurity that the ipc initiative ha ever classified for any given area or country `` . it most senior human right official , volker türk , told the bbc that israel bore significant blame for the crisis in gaza , and there wa a `` plausible `` case that it wa using starvation a a weapon of war . israel ha vehemently denied this . oxfam ha accused israel of `` deliberately blocking and/or undermining the international humanitarian response in the gaza strip `` . it warns that people living in gaza `` will suffer mass death from disease and starvation far beyond the current 31,000 palestinian war casualty , `` unless israel change it approach . the un ha increased pressure on israel to fulfil it legal responsibility to protect palestinian civilian and allow adequate supply of humanitarian aid into the region . israel insisted it wa letting in all the aid offered , and accused agency of failing to distribute it . elsewhere , un official warned that the ongoing conflict in sudan ha plunged the country into `` one of the worst humanitarian nightmare in recent history `` , which could trigger the world 's largest hunger crisis . according to the un 's world food programme ( wfp ) , nearly 18 million people in sudan are facing acute food insecurity a a result of the civil war which broke out in april 2023 . unicef said it had seen malnutrition among young child `` beyond the worst projection `` , a well a outbreak of cholera , measles and malaria . the humanitarian organisation action against hunger said several other country also have `` very concerning level of hunger `` . these include afghanistan , the democratic republic of congo , ethiopia , pakistan , somalia , syria and yemen . in march 2024 , the wfp warned that haiti - which is experiencing a severe political and economic crisis amidst spiralling gang violence - wa `` on the edge of a devastating hunger crisis `` . about 1.4m people there are categorised a being on the verge of famine , with another three million at the level below . the ipc 's description of haiti 's food security situation is `` alarming `` . according to the ipc , famine and extreme food crisis have multiple cause , which can be man-made , nature-driven , or a combination of both . action against hunger said conflict remains the `` key driver of hunger around the world `` . in sudan , it blamed the war for insufficient food production and resulting high price . it also said the ongoing conflict in gaza wa preventing lifesaving food , fuel and water entering the territory . the ipc highlighted humanitarian organisation ' `` near-complete lack of access `` to most of gaza . the international rescue committee ( irc ) said drought and crop failure caused by extreme weather event a a result of climate change were leading to widespread food shortage , particularly in east africa . el niño - a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface water in the pacific ocean - ha already impacted food supply in southeast asia and latin america . the declaration of famine doe not unlock specific funding . however , it often trigger a large international response from other un agency and international government , who can provide food supply and emergency funding . some humanitarian agency like the irc provide malnutrition treatment . oxfam ha worked with partner in gaza to distribute voucher and cash for food and hygiene item . the wfp is working in sudan to restore infrastructure like road and school . it also ha mobile response team that travel to remote area to deliver food and other assistance . many agency typically start to plan and deliver aid before a famine ha been declared in order to avoid the worst effect - usually when a country ha been given a phase three classification or above . the last time famine wa officially declared wa in south sudan in 2017 . nearly 80,000 people faced starvation and another million were on the brink of famine after three year of civil war . at the time , the un blamed the effect of war on agriculture . farmer lost livestock , crop production wa severely curtailed , and inflation soared . previous famine include southern somalia in 2011 , southern sudan in 2008 , gode in the somali region of ethiopia in 2000 , north korea in 1996 , somalia in 1991-1992 and ethiopia in 1984-1985 . between 1845 and 1852 , ireland suffered a period of starvation , disease and emigration that became known a the great famine . about one million people are thought to have died when the country 's potato crop -

back in november , there were accusation of possible violation of international law a israeli tank closed in on al-shifa , in the heart of gaza city . premature baby were among those who died a condition deteriorated in the besieged hospital . the idf released surveillance camera footage which showed two hostage snatched from israel being taken into the hospital . after an extensive search , israeli troop blew up a large tunnel with room which ran under the site and later withdrew . the israeli army went on to suggest that hamas 's regional brigade and battalion in the north of the gaza strip had been disbanded . but soon report emerged that small cell were regrouping . while hamas ha undoubtedly been severely weakened by the war , there have since been sign that it ha been trying to restore it governing capability , including through policing and with some possible involvement in aid distribution . washington ha indicated that israel 's renewed military action at al-shifa hospital illustrates it worry that it close ally doe not have an adequate strategy to dismantle the organisation . `` israel cleared shifa once . hamas came back into shifa , which raise question about how to ensure a sustainable campaign against hamas so that it can not regenerate , can not retake territory , `` the u national security adviser , jake sullivan , said this week . the u ha been pressing israel to come up with a feasible alternative for hamas rule in gaza . it plan ha been to promote individual linked to the internationally recognised palestinian authority ( pa ) and to work with arab state to prevent a power vacuum . israel previously said it wa seeking to cooperate with clan leader in gaza without affiliation to the pa or hamas . now , the wall street journal ha reported that israeli security official are `` quietly developing a plan to distribute aid `` , working with palestinian leader and businessmen not linked to hamas . the suggestion is that this `` could eventually create a palestinian-led governing authority `` . israeli medium have suggested the operation at shifa hospital could last for several day . it is not being linked to the military operation in rafah which israel insists it must carry out to win the war with hamas . there ha been international concern over the impact such an offensive on the egypt border could have a more than half of the 2.3m resident of gaza are now displaced there . `` it 's going to happen . and it will happen even if israel is forced to fight alone , `` the israeli strategic affair minister , ron dermer , told the call me back with dan senor podcast . while the idf ha formulated operational plan for rafah and handed these to israel 's government , no order ha yet been given to execute them . it is seen a unlikely that such a move will take place during the islamic holy month of ramadan , which end around 9 april . it would also take time for israel to build up the necessary force in gaza . despite declaration to the contrary , israeli expert also believe that in order for a rafah operation to be effective , ultimately coordination will be needed with egypt and the u . `` the egyptian are on the other side of the border , `` pointed out retired general amos gilad on israel 's kan radio . `` you ca n't do anything in rafah without coordinating with the egyptian and the american .

2024-03-22T16:38:10.000Z,BBC,"russia and china have blocked a u draft resolution put to the un which for the first time called for a ceasefire and hostage release in gaza . while there have been previous attempt by other country to call for a ceasefire , the u text marked a hardening of it stance towards israel . but russia and china used their veto . moscow called the text `` hypocritical `` . the move by the u , israel 's key ally , come at a time of growing tension between them . washington ha made clear that it expects israel to lessen the intensity of it offensive in gaza , where the hamas-run health ministry say at least 31,988 people - mainly woman and child - have been killed since the war began on 7 october . it ha also said it would not support an israeli attack on the city of rafah without a plan to protect civilian there , and ha urged israel to allow more humanitarian aid into gaza . israel 's prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , ha said that israel will go ahead with a planned ground assault on rafah , even without the support of it key ally . the u secretary of state , antony blinken , in tel aviv for talk , said such an operation wa not the answer . `` it risk killing more civilian , it risk wreaking greater havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance , it risk further isolating israel around the world and jeopardising this long-term security and standing , `` he said . the u - one of five permanent member of the security council with the power of veto - ha previously blocked resolution calling for a ceasefire , saying such a move would be wrong while delicate negotiation for a truce and hostage release were continuing between israel and hamas . but on friday it publicly changed it position , in a carefully-worded draft . `` the security council , `` the text read , `` determines the imperative of an immediate and sustained ceasefire `` , adding `` and towards that end unequivocally support ongoing international diplomatic effort to secure such a ceasefire in connection with the release of all remaining hostage `` . in doing so , the u linked it support for a ceasefire to the release of the israeli hostage - 253 - held by hamas . although russia and china vetoed the draft , 11 country on the 15-member council voted in favour of it . algeria voted against it and guyana abstained . early on saturday , a vote on a new text calling for a ceasefire wa postponed until monday , diplomat told the afp and reuters news agency . before friday 's vote , russia 's ambassador to the un , vassily nebenzia , criticised the text a `` exceedingly politicised `` , accusing it of doing nothing to avert israel 's planned assault on rafah . more than half of gaza 's 2.3 million palestinian are sheltering in the southern city , where israel say hamas leader are hiding and hamas battalion still operate . the u ambassador to the un , linda thomas-greenfield , called russia and china 's action `` deeply , deeply cynical `` . `` russia and china simply did not want to vote for a resolution that wa penned by the united state , because it would rather see u fail than see this council succeed , `` she said . speaking after talk with mr netanyahu , mr blinken said the u wa trying to show the international community `` a sense of urgency `` . a ceasefire tied to the release of hostage , he said , wa `` something that everyone , including the country that veto the resolution should have been able to get behind `` . french president emmanuel macron said his country would now work on an alternative resolution . `` what 's important to note is that the united state ha changed it position , and shown it will to defend , very clearly now , a ceasefire , `` mr macron said . `` for a long time , the american were reticent . that reticence is now gone . ``",israel rescue two hostage in rafah amid deadly strike

a catastrophe that wa worse , it said , than the displacement of hundred of thousand of palestinian in 1948 , when the israeli state wa created . sabri saidam say the party is now waiting to see whether this incident mark the end of hamas talking to the plo , `` or is just a reflection of the chaos hamas is in `` . it 's early day , but so far the `` renewal `` of the pa ha n't yet delivered either unity with rival political faction , or credibility with the palestinian people . election - and a new leader - might help with both . `` it 's so depressing to be 33-years-old - like i am now - and i have n't voted even once in my country , `` said arab barghouti , son of the jailed political leader marwan barghouti . `` people my age are minister or parliament member in many other country , but for u it 's a dream to vote , `` he told me . `` we need that renewal in the whole system - and that can only happen with election . `` arab 's father marwan - currently serving five life sentence for murder in an israeli jail - is probably the most popular figure in palestinian politics . his supporter call him the palestinian mandela . he is one of few figure who could potentially unite the different palestinian faction . and his name is likely to be near the top of the list of palestinian prisoner that hamas would want released in exchange for freeing israeli hostage held in gaza . but barghouti wa blocked from a previous prisoner exchange deal in 2011 , and israel 's government ha little incentive to agree to his release now . the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , ha proudly declared that he will block the formation of a palestinian state and is widely seen a having promoted division between the west bank and gaza a a way of doing that . a popular , unifying figure like barghouti - convicted of murdering israeli - is the last person he want leading the palestinian . mahmoud abbas also ha much to fear from his release . in their polling , the palestinian centre for policy and survey research pitted marwan barghouti against both mahmoud abbas , and ismail haniyeh from hamas . marwan barghouti would win by a mile against either of them , the projection suggested . there are other figure who are seen a potential bridge-makers - mohammed dahlan is one - but even a unifying figure , or credible election , wo n't solve all the problem facing palestinian politics . it wo n't , for example , solve the problem of what to do with hamas . to what extent hamas still hold power in gaza , after more than five month of war , is complicated and difficult to assess . there have been report of law and order breaking down , and of armed gang linked to gaza 's big family competing for resource . but hamas fighter are still confronting israeli force across the gaza strip , most of it top leadership still appear to be free , and israel say several hamas battalion remain intact in the southern border town of rafah . even the civilian committee responsible for distributing aid in gaza city are overwhelmingly affiliated with hamas , one resident said . any new administration in gaza will need to have at least the tacit support of the group or face ongoing friction , or an insurgency . the dilemma will be how to give hamas a voice - even a discreet one - without triggering resistance from influential outside power like the u - and , of course , from israel , which is also trying to veto any role for the pa in gaza . that dilemma is compounded by continued support for hamas across both palestinian territory . support spiked in the first few month of the war , and now seems to be falling a bit , but a majority of those interviewed by the palestinian centre for policy and survey research said they wanted hamas to run gaza after the war ; only 11 % wanted the pa to take charge there . the last time palestinian voted in election , in 2006 , hamas won . the chance of them being allowed to openly run candidate in any new election are virtually zero - but that doe n't change the mood on the ground . with israeli force still fighting their way through gaza , the new shape of palestinian politics is not yet fixed . how the war end - and how strong hamas remains after it - will be key . the u government , among others , ha dangled the old familiar prize of a future palestinian state to encourage both palestinian leader and their arab ally to unite around their vision . but the failure of internationally backed peace deal - and the institution they created - are already partly what drive support for armed group like hamas . preparing for election is , sabri saidam belief , the biggest feasible step to restore faith in palestinian politics . the first priority will be reconstructing gaza , he said . `` but my personal take is that , once we engage in reconstruction , it will be extremely helpful if we set an election date within a year-and-a-half . and that the world realises we are serious . `` for the past two decade , sea-changes in palestinian politics have been rare - and sometimes violent . despite all this , arab barghouti is optimistic . `` we palestinian do n't have the privilege of being hopeless , `` he told me . `` if we lose hope , we lose our country , we lose our land . palestinian need hope . we have n't had hope in a very long time . ``",cornish charity launch emergency aid for gaza

with scorch mark still visible from previous launch . each missile cost more than â£1m ( $ 1.3m ) . they are the ship 's main line of defence . but diamond also ha phalanx machine gun and 30mm cannon on each side of the ship - close-in weapon . the phalanx can fire more than 3,000 round a minute . for the very first time the crew have also used the 30mm cannon to successfully shoot down a drone . diamond 's main task in the red sea ha been to protect merchant ship travelling through this key trade route . but for this mission she 'd be escorting a naval task force of uk support ship sailing towards the indian ocean - with two u destroyer providing additional protection . up on the bridge the navigator , lt josh tyrie , showed the route we 'd be taking - past houthi-controlled territory in yemen , through the narrow bab al-mandab strait and out into the gulf of aden . they call this the high threat area -

israel ha blamed the un , accusing it of failing to carry out distribution . the current war broke out after hamas gunman burst through the border and attacked israeli community , killing about 1,200 people , according to israeli tally , and taking 253 into gaza a hostage . of those taken , 130 remain unaccounted for following a series of release , rescue and the recovery of body . despite israel 's decision to cancel a planned visit by it delegation to washington later this week in the wake of the security council resolution , mr kirby ha said that scheduled meeting between israeli defence minister yoav gallant and u national security adviser jake sullivan will continue a planned . `` we look forward to making it clear to the defence minister that the united state continues to stand with israel a they fight hamas , `` he said at the press briefing on monday .",un security council pass resolution calling for gaza ceasefire - bbc news

item 7 - to scrutiny of the situation in `` palestine and the other occupied arab territory `` . the agenda item wa approved not by the un itself , but by un member state , decade ago , and ha never expired . no other country in the world ha permanent scrutiny like this , and israel view it a discriminatory , and aimed at delegitimising israel . it refuse to attend the council when item 7 is under discussion . but many country , in particular those in the middle east , argue that the situation - in the absence of self-determination for palestinian through a two-state solution - requires ongoing investigation , and now that there is another conflict , all the more so . since hamas 's brutal attack on israel on 7 october , m albanese ha called for the release of the hostage , and doe so again in this report . in it she `` firmly condemns the crime committed by hamas and other palestinian armed group in israel on 7 october `` . but she ha also been outspoken in her criticism of israel 's conduct of the war in gaza . that 's why her report ha been awaited with both impatience , and trepidation . m albanese 's choice of a title for it : ' anatomy of a genocide ' wa not exactly diplomatic . many member state , especially those traditionally supportive of israel , will be uncomfortable . but un special rapporteur , while tasked by the un to examine and advise on specific situation , are independent of it . genocide is a specific legal term , and m albanese 's report suggests some of the legal criterion have been fulfilled . she cite what she say appears to be israel 's intention to destroy palestinian a a group `` in whole or in part `` , a key clause in the convention against genocide . she mention in particular three element which point to possible genocide : the death toll in gaza , currently well over 32,000 according to gaza 's hamas-run health ministry , the bombing of densely populated area , and the restriction on aid supply ( which , the un say , have brought gaza to the brink of famine ) , are all proof , the report claim , of intent to destroy the group . basel alsourani , of the palestinian centre for human right , welcomed the report . he suggested international law had been violated by all side in this conflict , but argued that genocide wa such a serious crime the international community could not ignore it . `` allowing genocide to happen doe n't only affect palestinian … , it affect all human being around the world , `` he said . `` if now israel is committing genocide without accountability , tomorrow we do n't know which country will claim that genocide ha been committed by israel , and [ therefore ] i can commit genocide with no accountability . `` tala nasir , a palestinian human right lawyer who also travelled to geneva to hear the report , hoped it would draw more attention to the fate of what she said were thousand of people detained by israel since 7 october . `` they have arrested more than 7,700 palestinian , `` she said . `` eighty per cent of them are being held under administrative detention which mean they are not presenting any charge against them . `` their family , she pointed out , had no contact with them , and no idea where they were . not surprisingly , israeli diplomat are angry . it ambassador to the un in geneva , meirav eilon shahar , described the report a `` an obscene inversion of reality `` , and accused m albanese of questioning israel 's right to exist . many israeli , too , are likely to be shocked . and the suggestion of genocide , towards a state which wa founded a a direct result of nazi germany 's genocide of jew , will cause deep offence . in the wake of 7 october attack , and the fact that so many israeli family are still waiting for news of loved one taken hostage , hearing such outspoken condemnation is hard . noam peri , whose father chaim wa taken hostage , also travelled to geneva . her focus , naturally , is that her father not be forgotten . `` my father wa kidnapped from his own home , `` she said . `` he 's an 80-year-old person that wa sitting in his home with my mother , and he wa brutally taken from there , and ha essentially disappeared since . he ha no communication , with no-one in the world . `` but , a this week 's vote for an immediate ceasefire at the un security council show , member state are growing impatient with israel 's conduct of the war . too many well-respected un aid agency have warned that nowhere in gaza is safe , that family are now eating animal feed , or grass , that amputation are being performed on child without anaesthetic . they all say israel is restricting vital aid supply , and government have begun to doubt israel 's claim that the un is to blame for the delay . many will not like francesca albanese 's choice of word , but the content of her report will add to the pressure on israel to change it strategy .",jewish settler set their sight on gaza beachfront

neither hezbollah or it patron in tehran wanted an all-out war with israel and , indirectly , it american backer . the american did not want that either and restrained israel 's instinct to respond in full force . but hezbollah still tied down thousand of israeli troop and forced the evacuation of something like 80,000 civilian from the border area . israel 's response , limited compared to earlier border war , forced the displacement of at least a many civilian on the lebanese side . since the start of this year it ha been different . israel ha been setting the pace , bombing it enemy deeper inside lebanon and syria . the biggest leap up the ladder of escalation came on monday with the assassination by air strike on the iranian diplomatic compound in the syrian capital . in interview here in northern israel local official and resident have expressed strong support not just for the assassination but for an invasion of south lebanon to destroy hezbollah and force them back from the border . they were not put off by israel 's experience in the last two decade of the 20th century , when it occupied a broad strip of south lebanon to try to protect northern israel . it even created it own lebanese militia to help with the fighting . the israeli pulled out in 2000 , under constant military harassment from hezbollah , after prime minister ehud barak , a former head of the army , decided that occupying south lebanon ( israel called it the `` security zone `` ) did not make israeli any safer and wasted the life of it troop . i walked through the ruin of the avivim winery , which is right on the border wire . it wa destroyed in a hezbollah strike last week . it owner shlomi biton showed me through the wreck of his business . he is 47 and wa born in avivim , which like the rest of northern israel ha become a ghost town after the evacuation . shlomi fought in lebanon during his military service , and now belief that the only way to restore a decent and safe life is for israel to return to lebanon for a decisive battle with hezbollah . `` there 's no other choice , `` he told me next his burnt-out business . `` otherwise , the community wo n't return to live here , maybe just a few crazy guy like me -

killing of seven of it aid worker in an israeli air strike . another u charity it work with , anera , ha also suspended work because of the escalating risk faced by it local staff and their family . together , they were serving two million meal a week across the palestinian territory , where the un ha warned that an estimated 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger because of israeli restriction on aid delivery , the ongoing hostility and the breakdown of order . wck 's decision to pause it work also led to the `` freezing `` of a maritime aid corridor from cyprus , which the charity helped set up last month to increase the trickle of aid getting into the north of gaza and avert a looming famine . the wck convoy wa hit on monday night a it travelled south along the israeli-designated coastal aid route , just after they had unloaded more than 100 tonne of food from a barge at a warehouse in deir al-balah . that barge wa part of a four-vessel flotilla that sailed back to cyprus with 240 tonne of supply that could not be brought ashore in the wake of the strike . the norwegian refugee council warned that `` what happened to world central kitchen threatens the entire aid system `` and had left it `` on the brink `` . wck accused the israeli military of a `` targeted attack `` on vehicle clearly marked with the charity 's logo and whose movement had been co-ordinated with israeli authority . the victim were british , polish , australian and palestinian , and also included a dual us-canadian citizen . the military 's chief of staff , lt gen herzi halevi , described the strike a a `` grave mistake `` that had followed `` misidentification at night `` . he also vowed to take `` immediate action `` to ensure that more wa done to

the effectiveness of co-ordination with the israeli military . for the people of gaza , the suspension of wck 's operation `` mean more famine , more dead child , more epidemic disease because people are so malnourished `` , mr egeland warned . at least 27 child are reported to have died a a result of malnutrition since october , according to the world health organization . mr egeland urged israel to start by opening the karni and erez border crossing with northern gaza to allow aid convoy to drive there directly . most aid convoy are currently forced to start at the israeli-controlled kerem shalom and egyptian-controlled rafah crossing with the south of gaza and then pas through what the un call `` high-risk area `` , mainly due to shooting and shelling or the breakdown in civil order .

port is only a 40km drive from northern gaza . a c-130 transport plane meanwhile ha a maximum payload of 21 tonne , but only about 40 airdrop have taken place so far and they are considered expensive , ineffective and dangerous for people on the ground . the un say 159 lorry load of aid crossed into gaza by land each day on average between 1 and 28 march , and that the pre-war average wa 500 lorry load , including fuel . cogat say the pre-war average only included 70 food lorry and that 140 entered each day during march . it insists there is no limit to the amount of food and other humanitarian aid that can enter gaza and accuses un agency of failing to distribute aid effectively . there wa no apparent drop-off in aid crossing into gaza following the strike on the wck convoy , with 217 lorry

the israeli military ha declared `` humanitarian zone `` but ha still carried out strike on what it say are hamas target . dr bashar murad , the executive director of the palestinian red crescent , said many of it paramedic were refusing to evacuate wounded and sick people from the north to the south in their ambulance due to the lack of safety guarantee , despite their protection under international law and co-ordination effort by international organisation . aseel baidoun of medical aid for palestinian said it had not suspended operation after a strike in january damaged a residential compound in al-mawasi that housed the british charity 's local team and their family , injuring several people . but now , she added : `` we really are scared of the security [ situation ]

him and his colleague continuing their work . `` the danger of not providing aid is no less important than the danger of being killed , `` he added . natalia anguera of action against hunger also said it would try to continue working despite `` more and more challenging `` condition . `` most of our staff are . . . palestinian . they are suffering themselves , but they also have a very strong and clear commitment to their humanitarian mandate . they want to go on delivering , `` she told the bbc . she said the international community needed to push strongly for a humanitarian ceasefire because it wa the only way that aid organisation would be able to scale up their response to the level required . mr egeland also stressed the importance of the un agency for palestinian refugee ( unrwa ) , which he said wa `` bigger than the rest of u combined `` but wa being `` systematically undermined by israel `` . israel accuses unrwa of supporting hamas , which triggered the war when it gunman attacked southern israel on 7 october last year . the agency ha denied this , but in january it sacked nine of the 12 employee accused in an israeli document of playing a part in the attack . unrwa

together , they were serving two million meal a week across the palestinian territory , where the un ha warned that an estimated 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger because of israeli restriction on aid delivery , the ongoing hostility and the breakdown of order . wck 's decision to pause it work also led to the `` freezing `` of a maritime aid corridor from cyprus , which the charity helped set up last month to increase the trickle of aid getting into the north of gaza and avert a looming famine . the wck convoy wa hit on monday night a it travelled south along the israeli-designated coastal aid route , just after they had unloaded more than 100 tonne of food from a barge at a warehouse in deir al-balah . that barge wa part of a four-vessel

who declined to be named - told the time the killing of people on a humanitarian mission wa `` inexcusable `` . `` accountability is the only hope of justice i have `` , he said . `` i do n't believe our government will hold the correct people to account , but i guarantee that our government will sell weapon to israel , which may in turn be used to kill our fellow citizen . `` it 's hard to comprehend that . `` british arm sale to israel are lower than those of other country , including germany and italy , and dwarfed by the billion supplied by it largest arm supplier , the u . but a uk ban would add to the diplomatic and political pressure on israel , at a time when it conduct in the gaza conflict is coming under renewed international scrutiny . the bbc understands there is an ongoing assessment over whether to suspend or revoke existing export license to israel , which is almost finished . that assessment , which will advise on the risk of israel breaching international law , is not a result of the recent air strike . in fact it may not even consider the incident , since it is looking at israel 's action from early 2024 . technically it is up to the business secretary to decide on issuing arm export license , but one mp familiar with the process said , in reality , it will be mr sunak who will make the decision when the foreign office issue it legal advice . on thursday evening , former uk foreign secretary jack straw told the bbc he believed it wa `` perfectly obvious `` israel wa breaching international law . mr straw told radio 4 's pm programme that israeli force had been `` caught out `` by the killing of western aid worker but suggested they `` would have dug in and refused any accountability at all `` if all the victim had been palestinian . former supreme court president lady hale wa among the lawyer , academic and retired senior judge who signed a 17-page letter to the government on the issue of arm sale to israel . it say `` serious action `` is needed to `` avoid uk complicity in grave breach of international law , including potential violation of the genocide convention `` . the group add that the sale of arm and weapon system to israel `` fall significantly short `` of the government 's obligation under international law , given the `` plausible risk of genocide `` in gaza - a situation that the letter say wa highlighted in a provisional judgement issued by the international court of justice ( icj ) in january - and the worsening humanitarian situation since . speaking on bbc radio 4 's today programme , lord sumption , the former supreme court judge who wa one of the most notable signatory , said the uk had a duty to prevent genocide and there wa a `` plausible case that is what is happening `` in gaza . he added that the `` framework of international law around war `` doe not mean country can act however they want , even if they have been provoked or attacked , `` however outrageously `` . lord sumption continued : `` it doe n't mean to say that you can indiscriminately slaughter innocent civilian and child . it doe n't mean to say you can attack aid convoy . . . it doe n't mean to say you can spend two week flattening hospital . `` among other action the letter say the government must take to meet it obligation under international law are : mr sunak called for an independent investigation into the air strike , but stopped short of saying arm sale should end , in an interview with the sun newspaper after the incident . he added that the uk had been `` consistently clear `` with israel that it must follow international humanitarian law . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu ha described the attack a unintended and `` tragic `` , and promised an independent investigation . it reject the claim of genocide a `` wholly unfounded `` . the uk ha licenced arm to israel worth over £ 574m since 2008 , when official country-level data wa made available , according to pressure group campaign against arm trade ( caat ) . business minister greg hand ha previously told mp the figure for 2022 - £ 42m - represented 0.02 % of israel 's military import that year . arm export licence , which are granted by the business department , can not be issued if there is a clear risk the weapon could be used in a serious violation of international humanitarian law . labour ha not called for a suspension , but is urging the government to publish internal legal advice on whether israel is in breach of international law . the snp is calling for parliament to be recalled from it current easter break , ending on 15 april , to debate the issue . conservative mp paul bristow said the idea british-made arm could be used in action that kill innocent civilian in gaza `` turn the stomach . `` but his fellow tory mp and former home secretary suella braverman rejected a ban , telling the bbc `` we owe it to israel to stand with them . `` speaking during a trip to israel , she said : `` i think that it would be a tragic shame if we were to walk away from our closest ally in this region . `` fellow conservative mp bob seely , who sits on the foreign affair committee , said those calling on the government to end arm sale were engaging in `` shallow gesture politics `` . he told bbc newsnight `` the reality is that we supply 0.02 % of israel 's arm import , which is a meaninglessly small figure , and actually by blocking it , effectively , this is shallow gesture politics and nothing but . `` mr seely said the uk should instead `` double down `` on it relationship with israel . much of the gaza strip ha been devastated during the israeli military operation that began after hamas gunman attacked southern israel on 7 october , killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostage . about 130 of the hostage have not been released , with at least 34 of them presumed to be dead . more than 32,916 people have been killed in gaza since that first week of october , the hamas-run health ministry say . additional reporting by emily atkinson .",gaza convoy : idf say it fired at ' suspect ' but not at aid truck

2024-04-07T04:49:36.000Z,BBC,"six month after the hamas attack on israel , war , disease , starvation and death ravage palestinian in gaza . israel is deeply divided , a it prime minister struggle to keep his promise of total victory . the united state , israel 's most essential ally , ha turned against the way it is fighting the war . with iran vowing vengeance for israel 's assassination of a leading iranian general in syria , and month of cross-border conflict with iran 's ally hezbollah in lebanon , the risk of an all-out middle east war are increasing . the statistic record the horror of the past six month . more than 33,000 gazans , a majority of whom were civilian , have been killed , according to the health ministry . according to save the child , 13,800 palestinian child in gaza have been killed and over 12,009 wounded . unicef report at least 1,000 child have had one or both leg amputated . about 1,200 people , mostly civilian , were killed by hamas on 7 october , and 253 people were taken into gaza a hostage . israel say that of 130 hostage still there , at least 34 are dead . a un team reported in march that it had `` clear and convincing information `` that hostage had been subjected to sexual violence `` including rape , sexualised torture , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment `` . it said there were `` reasonable ground `` to believe that the violence against hostage wa continuing . kibbutz nir oz is right on israel 's border with gaza . it feel like a time capsule still stuck in the horror of 7 october 2023 . just after first light on that morning , hamas broke through the wire . by the time the israeli army arrived in the early afternoon , a quarter of the 400 or so israeli who lived there had either been killed by hamas or taken hostage . ron bahat showed me around . he is a man in his 50 who grew up at nir oz . ron survived with his family through good luck and arm strong enough to hold shut the door of the safe room when hamas entered his house . we walked along the neat line of small house , with garden that are now overgrown . many had bullet hole or were burnt out and had not been disturbed since the body of the dead were recovered . ron pointed out the home of friend and neighbour who were killed or taken a captive to gaza . in one badly damaged house , a pile of neatly ironed child 's clothes had somehow survived the fire . the family who lived there did not . one grim irony is that nir oz is part of a left-wing movement whose member traditionally support the idea of peace with the palestinian . six month after hamas crossed into nir oz , ron is not ready to make any concession to gaza . `` look , i wish that there will be a leader to bring some prosperity there , because in the end we must have peace . but anyone who support hamas is an enemy . the moment they leave their weapon , the war will stop . the moment that israel leaf it weapon , we will not exist . that 's the difference . `` in nir oz , broken glass still crunch underfoot and gutted house smell of burnt wood and plastic . no-one is there to clean it up . a few of the surviving resident have come back on short visit , but most are staying away , living in hotel in central israel . yamit avital wa back for a few hour , showing around a friend . on that morning in october , she had been staying in tel aviv . her husband wa at home and escaped with the child . his brother , living not far away , wa killed . yamit 's hand shook slightly when she wa talking about coming back to live in nir oz again . `` i do n't know , it 's too earlyâ_x0080_ ¦ maybe only when the hostage come back we can start to think about it . we ca n't think about it now . i have too many friend there , in gaza . `` no-one ha been able to show me around the ruin of khan younis or gaza city , or the tent of around 1.4 million displaced civilian in rafah , in the way ron bahat showed me nir oz . that 's because international journalist ca n't report from gaza , a israel and egypt , in control of the border , have not allowed them in . the only exception ha been invitation-only , highly supervised trip organised by the israel defense force ( idf ) . i have been on one , to northern gaza in early november . only a month or so into the war , israeli firepower had already reduced the area to a wasteland . evidence is accumulating that both hamas and israel may have committed war crime . the international court of justice ( icj ) in the hague is investigating israel for `` plausible `` allegation of genocide against the palestinian in a case brought by south africa . the icj can not try a case against hamas , which is classified a a terrorist organisation by the u and uk , and many others , a it is not a state . israel reject the charge that it is guilty of genocide . for many of it citizen and supporter it is grotesque and offensive to allege that the state created after nazi germany murdered six million jew in the holocaust is itself committing genocide . one of israel 's lawyer , tal becker , told the justice in court in the hague that `` the appalling suffering of civilian , both israeli and palestinian , is first and foremost the result of hamas ' strategy `` . palestinian see the charge through a different lens , shaped by year of military occupation by israel . many palestinian believe israel ha already created an apartheid state that denies them the most basic right . in jerusalem at easter , a prominent palestinian christian political activist , dimitri diliani , told me that `` killing child is killing child . it doe n't matter who is the child that 's being killed . it doe n't matter who is doing the killing `` . `` i recognise the holocaust , but that doe not mean a green light for israel to commit genocide against my people or any other people . `` the icj 's deliberation will take year and israel 's accuser will have to prove intent to win their case . war and the death of civilian do not add up to genocide on their own . south africa 's legal team argues that statement like the one made by israel 's defence minister yoav gallant on 9 october show genocidal intent . `` i have ordered a complete siege on the gaza strip . there will be no electricity , no food , no fuel , everything is closed , `` he said after visiting the idf southern command in beersheba . `` we are fighting human animal and we are acting accordingly . `` israel wa forced by international pressure , especially from washington , to loosen aspect of the blockade that the minister envisaged . the amount reaching gaza were still grossly inadequate . six month later , gaza is facing imminent famine , according to the integrated food security phase classification ( ipc ) a body backed by government , the un and aid group to provide rigorous and apolitical information and analysis in a food emergency . oxfam report that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since january on an average of 245 calorie a day - the equivalent of a tin of bean . gaza 's humanitarian catastrophe ha also been recorded in detail by palestinian journalist , civilian posting on social medium , and the international organisation running the aid operation , whose staff are allowed to enter the territory . seven from the world central kitchen ( wck ) , which had been providing million of meal , were killed by the israeli army on 1 april . their death outraged president biden and other western leader who are staunch ally of israel . their condemnation of the killing left israel even more isolated . israel expects no sympathy from much of the world . but it ha come to expect support and understanding from powerful western ally . instead , they have rejected israel 's claim it doe not impede the movement of relief supply . president biden extracted unusually rapid concession from israel , which promised greater humanitarian access to gaza in a statement rushed out in the middle of the night here in jerusalem . perhaps he threatened to attach condition to the use of american weapon in gaza . the killing of the wck team seems to have been a tipping point for president biden , whose backing for israel ha been a constant throughout his long career in politics . supporting israel is still his firm principle , but the u is no longer prepared to turn that into a safety net for benjamin netanyahu and his extremist coalition partner . palestinian ask , with some anger and frustration , why it took the death of seven aid worker , including six westerner , to make a difference , after so many thousand of gazans had been killed . aid agency operating in gaza say the attack on the aid worker wa not an isolated incident , but the result of an engrained disregard for the life of palestinian civilian . president biden 's outrage might have been a long time coming but it could create a turning point in the war . over the next month or so , one way of assessing change is simply to count whether israel is killing fewer palestinian civilian , or whether increased food and medical aid can save gaza from famine . another test will be whether mr netanyahu defies american opposition and go ahead with a ground assault on rafah , where israel say the remaining organised unit of hamas must be destroyed . the u say that must not happen until israel can find a way to protect the life of almost 1.5 million palestinian who have taken refuge there . benjamin netanyahu ha delivered the `` mighty vengeance `` he promised israeli on 7 october . his other promise , of total victory , the destruction of hamas , and the return of the hostage have not been achieved . inside israel , he face severe political pressure . his approval rating in opinion poll have plummeted . in the past week in jerusalem thousand of protestors waving israeli flag blocked street around the parliament demanding the resignation of the prime minister and new election . `` netanyahu ha an interest to lengthen the war a much a he can , because a long a the war is still going on , he can say that now is not the time for new election , `` said nava rosalio , one of the leader of the anti-netanyahu movement . her group is called busha in hebrew , which translates a shame . `` he say now is not the time to look for who is responsible , which is he . so he prefers to keep the hostage in gaza , and he prefers to lengthen the war . `` when hamas attacked , israel wa deeply divided over his government 's right-wing policy and culture war between secular and religious israeli . in the shock that followed reservist who had suspended their military service a part of the protest rushed back into uniform . demonstration were paused in the interest of national unity . six month on , it is no longer considered unpatriotic to protest against the failure to end the war and free the hostage . israel 's division are wide open once more . mr netanyahu face searing accusation that his priority is his own political survival . to stay in power , he must preserve his coalition , which is built around the support of ultranationalist jewish party . they do not only oppose the mass release of palestinian security prisoner to buy the freedom of israeli hostage , without which a ceasefire will not happen . mr netanyahu 's two main ultranationalist ally , finance minister bezalel smotrich and national security minister itamar ben-gvir , go further . they both want palestinian to leave gaza so jew can settle there instead . the prime minister , renowned for his skill in the dark art of politics , is performing a balancing act to keep them happy while denying that mr smotrich and mr ben-gvir 's view reflect government policy . before october , israel 's division must have made it look vulnerable to hamas . six month on , the same schism within israel about the present and the future are making it harder to win the war . capturing or killing yahya sinwar , the hamas leader in gaza and mastermind of the 7 october attack , would give israel a chance to declare victory . but he is still alive , sending his response to proposal in successive round of ceasefire talk from wherever he is hiding . he is thought to be somewhere in the hamas tunnel network , protected by bodyguard and a human shield of israeli hostage . yahya sinwar must be disappointed that palestinian on the west bank , including east jerusalem have not risen up in support of gaza . some must be taking the long view , waiting to see how event unfold in gaza and the wider middle east . others are struggling to feed their family now that thousand of palestinian are no longer allowed to work in israel . some are scared . israel ha launched many deadly raid against armed group in the west bank , killing innocent bystander in the process and arresting thousand who are being held without trial . some palestinian farmer have been driven off their land after violent and sometimes deadly intimidation by extremist jewish settler . opinion poll show strong support among palestinian for the attack on 7 october , though many deny the evidence that hamas committed atrocity . at a noisy demonstration against the israeli in ramallah in the west bank , i asked joharah baker , a palestinian activist , whether the hamas attack had moved the palestinian any closer to independence from israeli rule . she said that wa not the point . `` what happened on 7 october is just one thing that happened in many long year of oppressionâ_x0080_ ¦ our struggle will continue until we are free . that is what any people under occupation , under oppression , under colonial settler will do . `` according to the leading palestinian pollster , khalil shikaki , even those who dislike hamas approve of the way it attack have put the palestinian desire for independence back on the political map of the middle east . the war ha accelerated a new way for that to happen . his latest poll indicate that younger palestinian do not think the two-state solution of an independent palestine alongside israel will ever emerge . instead , he say , a plurality of under-30s want a single state between the mediterranean sea and the river jordan , in which they believe they could fight and win democratic right . they compare their fight with the struggle against apartheid in south africa , and believe they have a palestinian nelson mandela waiting in an israeli jail . he is marwan barghouti , imprisoned since 2002 and serving five life sentence for murder . if he ran for president , the indication are that he would win easily . even though he is a leader of the rival palestinian faction , fatah , hamas put marwan barghouti 's name on the list of prisoner they want released in exchange for hostage . it is impossible to see jewish israeli ever giving up the jewish nature of their state . the fact that palestinian see that a a possibility is another sign of the distance between them . six month into the war , there is no immediate sign that it is ending . benjamin netanyahu ha avoided any specific about how gaza would be governed when this war end , except for insisting that israel must be in control - in other word , an occupation . he ha rejected america 's proposal to replace israeli troop with a force from the palestinian authority , which administers part of the west bank . the american want a pa , revitalised , eventually to govern gaza . that would most likely require new leadership . current palestinian president mahmoud abbas is elderly and hugely unpopular . palestinian say he ha failed to fight corruption , failed to show sympathy for gaza , and failed to order the palestinian police to protect them from aggressive jewish settler while he continues security cooperation with israel . benjamin netanyahu ha also rejected joe biden 's idea of a grand bargain that would transform the middle east . in return for allowing palestinian independence , israel would be recognised by saudi arabia , and the saudi would get a nato-style defence agreement with the u . instead , the prime minister tell israeli that he is the only man who can save them from the mortal hazard of a palestinian state imposed by america . that is music for the ultranationalists in his government , who are much keener to keep the west bank and all of jerusalem than make a deal with saudi arabia . away from the conference room where leader discus the future , the war ha created another enormous obstacle to peace . palestinian and israeli have not been a suspicious of each other since the turbulent decade of assassination , hijacking and war in the 1950s and 60 . the pollster khalil shikaki identifies an accelerated mutual process of dehumanisation since 7 october . `` the palestinian are not seen a partner for peace . they are not seen a people who deserve equality because of what they have done on 7 october . so , they [ israeli ] question their humanity . we see similar development , unfortunately , also among palestinian , who see what is happening in gaza . `` and they say those who are targeting woman and child , deliberately killing entire family , demolishing entire neighbourhood can not be human a well . so , they see them a monster . `` this dehumanisation is absolutely disastrous for the future . ``

without saying so explicitly - to signal to hamas that israel wa being very forthcoming with it from it perspective . `` ben caspit in the more centrist maariv newspaper wa even more forceful in his interpretation of the move . `` if you were to ask netanyahu ( and he wa asked ) , this wa done to prepare for the promised operation in rafah … there is a second explanation , one that ha been reported all over the world in every possible language . by that account , the 98th division 's withdrawal from khan yunis is linked to talk for a hostage deal . `` serious medium outlet around the world have reported that the conversation between president biden and prime minister netanyahu wa dramatic . biden led netanyahu to understand that he wa n't a pace away from victory , but a pace away from the final destruction of the alliance between israel and the united state . `` in public at least , mr netanyahu ha continued to ratchet up the rhetoric on rafah , saying that a date ha been set for the operation . his defence minister , yoav gallant , ha been more nuanced , telling army recruit that now is an `` opportune `` time to do a deal with hamas . but he stressed that a ceasefire would not be the end of the war : `` there will be difficult decision and we will be ready to pay the price in order to get the hostage back , and then return to fighting . `` the fighting is likely to continue , a mr gallant say , but the form it take may change substantially . with criticism of the way the war ha been conducted growing from israel 's most powerful ally , the u , the drawing down of force in gaza seems likely in part to be aimed at showing the biden administration that israel is listening to it concern over civilian casualty and life-threatening aid shortage . an end to bombardment that have reduced city to rubble , a ha been seen in the latest image from khan younis , may go some way to restoring the customary whole-hearted support for israel from washington . but that will undoubtedly be tested again , if the `` future operation `` that the israeli army say troop are being given rest and recuperation to prepare for mean a full-scale assault on rafah where israel belief hamas 's remaining military force are now based , among more than a million displaced palestinian . there may be a belief in the israeli government and military that a significant number of that population , squeezed into barely functioning shelter , may start moving back to their home now that the bulk of israeli troop is gone . but what palestinian have found on their return to khan younis is mass devastation , with many of their home reduced to rubble . they have described how gaza 's second city is now unliveable , not even fit for animal , a some have put it . meanwhile , the head of the un agency for palestinian refugee , unrwa , warned palestinian thinking of heading to khan younis about the threat of unexploded munition there following the israeli pullout . philippe lazzarini told the bbc there might be thousand of the device in the rubble . so a major exodus from rafah , which would make any israeli operation against hamas less likely to cause a new catastrophic toll of civilian casualty , may not be on the card . but the `` further operation `` may also relate to the conflict on israel 's northern front with hezbollah in lebanon . that confrontation ha been steadily escalating since 7 october . and there are fear that it could become far more intense , following the suspected israeli strike in damascus that killed several senior commander in iran 's powerful revolutionary guard last week . hezbollah is closely allied to iran and ha matched the rhetoric coming from tehran , vowing revenge . the israeli army ha recently said that it ha substantially strengthened it northern command . so , this too may have played a part in the troop withdrawal from gaza . whatever the true motif were - and they are likely to have involved a number of interlocking factor - it is unlikely that israel 's military engagement in gaza is anywhere close to coming to an end , with hamas fighter already having shown their capacity to regroup in area that had been subjected to the heaviest onslaught from the idf .",israel reveals eurovision song after week of wrangling

2024-04-09T20:09:41.000Z,BBC,"a truce between israel and the palestinian group hamas in gaza wa never going to be easy . week of talk have failed to produce agreement . but international pressure is growing . perhaps the biggest sign is the biden administration sending william burn , the head of the cia , for the latest round of talk in cairo . hamas ha , in public at least , stuck with it initial demand of a permanent ceasefire , the complete withdrawal of israeli troop and the return of displaced palestinian to northern part of the territory without restriction . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu meanwhile insists that israel will continue fighting until hamas is destroyed and hostage the group is holding are free . `` there 's a lot more american pressure on israel , and on egypt and qatar to put pressure on hamas . that 's obvious , `` said gershon baskin , who helped negotiate a deal with hamas for the release of israeli soldier gilad shalit in 2011 . `` the fact that the head of the cia showed up , which required all the negotiator to be there at the highest level . that 's indicative of increased american pressure . `` but that doe not mean a deal is at hand . israeli official have indicated willingness to make some concession amid intensifying frustration among the country 's main ally , including the u . earlier this week , the israeli defence minister , yoav gallant , suggested that now wa the right time for a truce . any deal is expected to see the release of some of the hostage captured in the hamas attack in return for palestinian prisoner being held in israeli jail , which wa the basis for a truce that led to a temporary pause in hostility in november . according to israeli authority , 133 people remain captive in gaza , although at least 30 have already been confirmed dead . under the latest u proposal , an initial phase of a six-week ceasefire would see hamas release 40 hostage who are alive , with the priority being given to female captive including soldier , men over the age of 50 and those with serious medical condition . israel would then release at least 700 palestinian , including about 100 who are serving life sentence for killing israeli , which ha proved controversial in israel in the past . but hamas ha reportedly told negotiator it is not holding 40 people in this category , raising the prospect that many more hostage than previously thought have died or that they could be in the hand of other armed group , such a palestinian islamic jihad . in israel , mr netanyahu 's room for manoeuvre is limited by pressure from different part of society and politics . while most of the israeli public remain supportive of the war , there are growing call for him to agree to a deal for the release of the hostage . the family have held large protest , accusing the prime minister of not making the captive ' return a priority and of being more concerned with his own political survival . call for mr netanyahu to resign are on the rise too . division have intensified within mr netanyahu 's governing coalition , which includes far-right , ultranationalist ally who refuse concession to hamas and insist the war must go on . finance minister bezalel smotrich told the prime minister that increasing pressure on hamas wa the only way to bring the hostage back and destroy the group , while national security minister itamar ben gvir explicitly threatened to bring down mr netanyahu himself if he did not go ahead with a much-promised offensive into the city of rafah , in southern gaza . israeli official insist it is essential to enter rafah , where , they say , hamas ha four operational brigade and it senior leader could be hiding . but virtually everyone outside israel is against an offensive in the city , where about 1.5 million palestinian are sheltering in tent , improvised shelter and overcrowded camp , over concern of the catastrophic impact it could have on civilian . in what could have been an attempt to counter domestic criticism , on monday , mr netanyahu said a date had already been set for a rafah operation , without giving detail . `` there 's a revolt going on right now in the government , and within [ mr netanyahu 's party ] likud , against netanyahu making any kind of deal that they do n't think should be made , `` mr baskin said . `` netanyahu is not a free actor . he 's a hostage himself within his own government . `` for it part hamas ha yet to give a formal response to the latest proposal , but said that while it wa interested in an agreement `` that put an end to the aggression on our people `` , the offer did not meet it demand . `` the israeli position remains intransigent , `` the group said in a statement . the white house described the group 's response a `` less than encouraging `` . a final decision will probably be made by yahya sinwar , the hamas leader in gaza who is thought to be hiding in tunnel surrounded by guard and hostage . but communication with him are difficult and said to involve several intermediary and take day . the group , mr baskin said , wa also demanding more say in which palestinian prisoner would be released and that it would not agree to any of them being deported to another country , issue that could present obstacle to negotiation . hamas also belief that without guarantee of a permanent ceasefire , israel will continue to attack the group once the hostage are released . it leadership ha witnessed growing international criticism of israel and may believe time is on their side to secure concession , despite the overwhelming and immediate need of gaza 's devastated civilian population . the war in gaza , israel 's response to the hamas attack on 7 october that killed about 1,200 people , ha killed more than 33,000 palestinian , according to the hamas-run health ministry , destroyed large part of the territory , and left many on the brink of famine . `` from my experience in dealing with these thing , the main difficulty are whether or not the main decision maker on both side is ready for a deal . that 's not clear , `` mr baskin said . `` it 's not clear that netanyahu is ready for a deal , it 's not clear that [ hamas political leader in gaza yahya ] sinwar is ready for a deal . but when they are , they will find the middle ground . `` perhaps unsurprisingly , a hamas spokesperson seized on mr netanyahu 's comment about setting a date for an attack on rafah , saying it raised question about the purpose of resuming negotiation .",israel say

israeli army in gaza on 1 april , u president joe biden seemed finally to lose patience with his troublesome ally . on the same day , israel attacked the iranian diplomatic compound in damascus , killing a senior general , at least six other officer , and violating legal convention that prohibit attack on embassy . israel claimed , unconvincingly , that iran had forfeited that protection by turning the consular building it destroyed into a military outpost . iran promised it would retaliate , but previous attack on senior commander had generated more word than action . outside iran , the attack on damascus wa overshadowed by the fury caused by the killing of the team from world central kitchen , a us-based charity . the white house issued a furious statement from president biden . he wa `` outraged and heartbroken `` . it wa not a standalone incident . israel wa not doing enough to protect aid worker or palestinian civilian . in an angry call with the prime minister , he demanded major concession . gaza should be flooded with humanitarian aid . israel must open more border crossing , a well a the container port in ashdod , less than an hour 's drive away from child starving to death in northern gaza . prime minister netanyahu promised that thing would change . despite that , israel wa stalling . a well a feeling the heat from the white house , mr netanyahu wa also under pressure from the ultranationalist extremist whose backing in israel 's parliament keep his coalition in power . not only are they opposed to flooding gaza with aid . they believe the war ha presented israel with a priceless opportunity to re-settle jew in gaza . jewish settlement there were evacuated and demolished by israel in 2005 a part of a unilateral withdrawal from the territory . by the end of last week , the u wa increasing the pressure . on thursday , samantha power , the top u humanitarian official , said it wa `` credible `` that famine wa already affecting part of gaza . it wa apparent to israel 's friend a well a it enemy that it six-month siege of gaza had created the world 's most urgent food crisis . there wa another burst of speculation that the u would put condition on the use of the weapon it supply to israel . on saturday morning , hour before the iranian attack on israel , the new york time echoed deepening outrage , especially among prominent democrat in the u congress . it called for a pause in the supply of weapon to israel and laid into benjamin netanyahu . under the headline , military aid to israel can not be unconditional , the paper 's editorial board slammed mr netanyahu and the hardliner in his government for breaking `` the bond of trust `` with america . the u commitment to israel , and it right to defend itself , did not mean that president biden `` should allow mr . netanyahu to keep playing his cynical double game `` , it said . then iran 's first-ever direct attack on israel offered the prime minister a lifeline . in a remarkable feat of military co-operation , the u and other western ally helped israel shoot down more than 300 drone and missile launched by iran . no arab leader ha been a sterner critic of israel 's war in gaza than king abdullah of jordan . but jordan 's air force joined the operation , downing projectile heading for israel . call for putting condition on military aid to israel were replaced by resounding expression of solidarity . prime minister netanyahu ha been presented with new political opportunity . gaza is out of the headline , for a day or two at least . but pressure on the prime minister ha changed . it ha not gone . israel 's next move might redouble it . president biden ha made it very clear what he think should happen next . israel should declare victory in this episode , `` take the win `` , and not hit back . he declared , again , that america 's support for israel wa `` ironclad `` . that fitted in to his consistent policy since the hamas attack on 7 october . the president and his administration have worked hard to stop a wider , all-out war in the middle east , even a they funnelled massive supply of arm to israel that have been used to devastating and deadly effect in gaza . since october israel ha accepted the weapon and the diplomatic support that accompanied them and ignored joe biden 's increasingly desperate and angry call to respect the law of war and protect civilian . just a few day after unprecedented military co-operation from it ally against iran , israel look once again to be bent on ignoring not just joe biden 's advice not to retaliate , but very similar sentiment from the other country that helped out on saturday night . just like joe biden , prime minister rishi sunak in britain and president emmanuel macron in france deployed combat aircraft , both condemned iran , and both have urged israel not to hit back . they are coming up against long-held belief and instinct in israel . one is the deep conviction that israel 's survival depends on responding to attack with overwhelming force . another is benjamin netanyahu 's view , expressed many time over his year in power , that iran is israel 's most dangerous enemy , bent on the destruction of the jewish state . many israeli share that view . now , after year of enmity since the islamic revolution in 1979 , iran ha for the first time mounted a direct attack on

2024-04-16T11:14:34.000Z,BBC,"it wa n't many day ago that israel 's prime minister benjamin netanyahu wa under enormous pressure . after seven aid worker from world central kitchen were killed by the israeli army in gaza on 1 april , u president joe biden seemed finally to lose patience with his troublesome ally . on the same day , israel attacked the iranian diplomatic compound in damascus , killing a senior general , at least six other officer , and violating legal convention that prohibit attack on embassy . israel claimed , unconvincingly , that iran had forfeited that protection by turning the consular building it destroyed into a military outpost . iran promised it would retaliate , but previous attack on senior commander had generated more word than action . outside iran , the attack on damascus wa overshadowed by the fury caused by the killing of the team from world central kitchen , a us-based charity . the white house issued a furious statement from president biden . he wa `` outraged and heartbroken `` . it wa not a standalone incident . israel wa not doing enough to protect aid worker or palestinian civilian . in an angry call with the prime minister , he demanded major concession . gaza should be flooded with humanitarian aid . israel must open more border crossing , a well a the container port in ashdod , less than an hour 's drive away from child starving to death in northern gaza . prime minister netanyahu promised that thing would change . despite that , israel wa stalling . a well a feeling the heat from the white house , mr netanyahu wa also under pressure from the ultranationalist extremist whose backing in israel 's parliament keep his coalition in power . not only are they opposed to flooding gaza with aid . they believe the war ha presented israel with a priceless opportunity to re-settle jew in gaza . jewish settlement there were evacuated and demolished by israel in 2005 a part of a unilateral withdrawal from the territory . by the end of last week , the u wa increasing the pressure . on thursday , samantha power , the top u humanitarian official , said it wa `` credible `` that famine wa already affecting part of gaza . it wa apparent to israel 's friend a well a it enemy that it six-month siege of gaza had created the world 's most urgent food crisis . there wa another burst of speculation that the u would put condition on the use of the weapon it supply to israel . on saturday morning , hour before the iranian attack on israel , the new york time echoed deepening outrage , especially among prominent democrat in the u congress . it called for a pause in the supply of weapon to israel and laid into benjamin netanyahu . under the headline , military aid to israel can not be unconditional , the paper 's editorial board slammed mr netanyahu and the hardliner in his government for breaking `` the bond of trust `` with america . the u commitment to israel , and it right to defend itself , did not mean that president biden `` should allow mr . netanyahu to keep playing his cynical double game `` , it said . then iran 's first-ever direct attack on israel offered the prime minister a lifeline . in a remarkable feat of military co-operation , the u and other western ally helped israel shoot down more than 300 drone and missile launched by iran . no arab leader ha been a sterner critic of israel 's war in gaza than king abdullah of jordan . but jordan 's air force joined the operation , downing projectile heading for israel . call for putting condition on military aid to israel were replaced by resounding expression of solidarity . prime minister netanyahu ha been presented with new political opportunity . gaza is out of the headline , for a day or two at least . but pressure on the prime minister ha changed . it ha not gone . israel 's next move might redouble it . president biden ha made it very clear what he think should happen next . israel should declare victory in this episode , `` take the win `` , and not hit back . he declared , again , that america 's support for israel wa `` ironclad `` . that fitted in to his consistent policy since the hamas attack on 7 october . the president and his administration have worked hard to stop a wider , all-out war in the middle east , even a they funnelled massive supply of arm to israel that have been used to devastating and deadly effect in gaza . since october israel ha accepted the weapon and the diplomatic support that accompanied them and ignored joe biden 's increasingly desperate and angry call to respect the law of war and protect civilian . just a few day after unprecedented military co-operation from it ally against iran , israel look once again to be bent on ignoring not just joe biden 's advice not to retaliate , but very similar sentiment from the other country that helped out on saturday night . just like joe biden , prime minister rishi sunak in britain and president emmanuel macron in france deployed combat aircraft , both condemned iran , and both have urged israel not to hit back . they are coming up against long-held belief and instinct in israel . one is the deep conviction that israel 's survival depends on responding to attack with overwhelming force . another is benjamin netanyahu 's view , expressed many time over his year in power , that iran is israel 's most dangerous enemy , bent on the destruction of the jewish state . many israeli share that view . now , after year of enmity since the islamic revolution in 1979 , iran ha for the first time mounted a direct attack on israel . a long clandestine war ha come out of the shadow . israel ha said the question is not if it will hit back , but when and how . the war cabinet ha been debating how to do it without igniting an all-out war . in the end , though , any attack will gamble that iran doe not want all-out war either , and will respond accordingly . that is a dangerous assumption . both side have already badly

said it effort were being undermined by politician seeking to score point . `` unfortunately , i mean , we have seen that there ha been an abuse of this mediation and an abuse of this mediation in favour of narrow political interest , `` he said at a news conference in doha on wednesday . `` this mean that the state of qatar ha called for a comprehensive evaluation of this role . we are now at this stage to evaluate mediation and also evaluate how the party engage in this mediation . `` he did not identify any individual , but some critical voice from within the u congress have accused qatar of not putting enough pressure on hamas to make concession . the u accused the palestinian armed group of being `` the obstacle to a ceasefire `` after it rejected the latest ceasefire offer . with new fear that the damaging war in gaza could escalate into a wider regional conflict , a tension rise between israel and iran , the qatari premier warned against the expansion of the conflict and called on the wider international community to assume it responsibility and stop the war . meanwhile , the israeli military said 14 israeli soldier had been injured , six of them severely , by anti-tank missile and drone launched from lebanese territory towards a village in northern israel . the iran-backed lebanese armed group hezbollah said it had fired on a military target in the arab al-aramshe area in retaliation for recent israeli strike that had killed hezbollah commander and other fighter . hezbollah - which like hamas is proscribed a a terrorist organisation by israel , the u , uk and other country - ha been exchanging fire with israeli force almost every day along the border since the start of the war in gaza . that conflict erupted when hamas gunman carried out an unprecedented attack on southern israel on 7 october , killing about 1,200 people , mainly civilian , and taking 253 others back to gaza a hostage . more than 33,800 people have been killed in gaza , the majority of them woman and child , during israel 's military campaign to destroy hamas and release the hostage , according to the territory 's hamas-run health ministry . a week-long ceasefire in november saw 105 hostage - most of them woman and child - freed in return for some 240 palestinian prisoner in israeli jail . israeli official say 133 hostage are being held in gaza - including four taken captive before the war - but that more than 30 of them are dead . on saturday , hamas put out a statement saying it wa ready to agree a `` serious and true `` hostage exchange deal with israel but rejected what wa currently on the table . it also reaffirmed that it wa sticking to it demand for a permanent ceasefire that would lead to a full withdrawal of israeli troop from gaza and the return of displaced palestinian to their home . israel 's mossad intelligence agency , whose director is leading the israeli negotiating team , said on sunday that hamas 's stance showed that it leader in gaza , yahya sinwar , `` doe not want a humanitarian deal and the return of the hostage , is continuing to exploit the tension with iran , and is striving to unite the sector and achieve a general escalation in the region `` . u state department spokesman matthew miller said on monday : `` the bottom line is hamas need to take that deal and they need to explain to the world and to the palestinian people why they are n't taking it . `` last week , a senior israeli official told u medium that hamas had informed mediator that it did not have 40 living hostage who meet one of the criterion laid out in the latest ceasefire proposal - child , woman , including soldier , men over the age of 50 and those with serious medical condition . a senior hamas official , meanwhile , said it needed a ceasefire to be under way to provide `` enough time and safety `` to locate all the hostage . sheikh mohammed also called on the international community to `` assume it responsibility and stop this war `` , warning that that civilian in gaza faced `` siege and starvation `` , with aid being used a a `` tool for political blackmail `` . a un-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people - half the population - were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine wa imminent in northern gaza . the un ha blamed israeli restriction on aid delivery , the ongoing hostility and the breakdown of order . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's office said on wednesday that he `` rejected the claim of international organisation regarding famine in gaza `` and insisted israel wa `` going above and beyond in the humanitarian sphere `` . the israeli military also announced that food aid had entered gaza from israel 's ashdod container port for the first time , with eight un world food programme lorry transporting flour via the israeli-controlled kerem shalom crossing with the south of the territory on wednesday . a new crossing with northern gaza wa also opened last week a israel sought to meet the demand made by u president joe biden following an israeli air strike in gaza on 1 april that killed seven world central kitchen aid worker . `` in the 12 day following my call with prime minister netanyahu , 3,000 truck with food and supply moved into gaza - a daily increase of over 50 % from the week prior , `` mr biden wrote on x , formerly twitter , on wednesday . however , the un agency for palestinian refugee ( unrwa ) , which is the largest humanitarian organisation in gaza , said in a report on tuesday that there had been `` no significant change in the volume of humanitarian supply entering gaza or improved access to the north `` . according to figure published by unrwa , an average of 185 lorry entered gaza per day via kerem shalom and the egyptian-controlled rafah crossing between 5 april - the day after mr biden spoke to mr netanyahu - and 15 april , the latest available date . the daily average wa 168 in the seven day between 29 march and 4 april , according to the data . a senior un humanitarian official also warned on tuesday that it wa still struggling to prevent famine even though there had been some improvement in the co-ordination of aid delivery with israel . `` it 's much bigger than simply bringing in flour and baking a few loaf of bread . it is really complex , `` andrea de domenico noted . `` water , sanitation and health are fundamental to curb famine . `` cogat , the israeli defence ministry body that is co-ordinating aid delivery to gaza , said 700 lorry load of supply were waiting to be collected on the palestinian side of kerem shalom . `` we scaled up our capability . all the un did wa make up excuse , `` it added . in a separate development on the ground in gaza on wednesday , the israeli military said it troop and aircraft had `` eliminated a number of terrorist and destroyed terrorist infrastructure `` in the centre of the territory . palestinian medium reported that there had been intense bombardment and fighting in and around nuseirat refugee camp , where 11 member of the al-nouri family were reportedly killed in a strike on their home on tuesday . the israeli military also said it force had carried out a raid `` to apprehend terrorist hiding in school `` in the northern town of beit hanoun . a number of hamas and palestinian islamic jihad operative were detained and others who resisted were killed , it added . four people were reportedly killed on tuesday when a house in beit hanoun wa hit and significantly damaged , according to the un . one man in neighbouring jabalia told bbc arabic 's gaza lifeline radio service : `` we were shocked by the advance of the occupation [ israeli ] force , which surrounded the entire area and arrested young men , woman and child . the force evacuated u from the area , killed people in beit hanoun , entered the shelter school , and arrested those inside them . `` `` this is how our life ha become unbearableâ_x0080_ ¦ whenever and wherever we walk , tank always shower u with shell . ``",an audible sigh of relief in the middle east -

said it effort were being undermined by politician seeking to score point . `` unfortunately , i mean , we have seen that there ha been an abuse of this mediation and an abuse of this mediation in favour of narrow political interest , `` he said at a news conference in doha on wednesday . `` this mean that the state of qatar ha called for a comprehensive evaluation of this role . we are now at this stage to evaluate mediation and also evaluate how the party engage in this mediation . `` he did not identify any individual , but some critical voice from within the u congress have accused qatar of not putting enough pressure on hamas to make concession . the u accused the palestinian armed group of being `` the obstacle to a ceasefire `` after it rejected the latest ceasefire offer . with new fear that the damaging war in gaza could escalate into a wider regional conflict , a tension rise between israel and iran , the qatari premier warned against the expansion of the conflict and called on the wider international community to assume it responsibility and stop the war . meanwhile , the israeli military said 14 israeli soldier had been injured , six of them severely , by anti-tank missile and drone launched from lebanese territory towards a village in northern israel . the iran-backed lebanese armed group hezbollah said it had fired on a military target in the arab al-aramshe area in retaliation for recent israeli strike that had killed hezbollah commander and other fighter . hezbollah - which like hamas is proscribed a a terrorist organisation by israel , the u , uk and other country - ha been exchanging fire with israeli force almost every day along the border since the start of the war in gaza . that conflict erupted when hamas gunman carried out an unprecedented attack on southern israel on 7 october , killing about 1,200 people , mainly civilian , and taking 253 others back to gaza a hostage . more than 33,800 people have been killed in gaza , the majority of them woman and child , during israel 's military campaign to destroy hamas and release the hostage , according to the territory 's hamas-run health ministry . a week-long ceasefire in november saw 105 hostage - most of them woman and child - freed in return for some 240 palestinian prisoner in israeli jail . israeli official say 133 hostage are being held in gaza - including four taken captive before the war - but that more than 30 of them are dead . on saturday , hamas put out a statement saying it wa ready to agree a `` serious and true `` hostage exchange deal with israel but rejected what wa currently on the table . it also reaffirmed that it wa sticking to it demand for a permanent ceasefire that would lead to a full withdrawal of israeli troop from gaza and the return of displaced palestinian to their home . israel 's mossad intelligence agency , whose director is leading the israeli negotiating team , said on sunday that hamas 's stance showed that it leader in gaza , yahya sinwar , `` doe not want a humanitarian deal and the return of the hostage , is continuing to exploit the tension with iran , and is striving to unite the sector and achieve a general escalation in the region `` . u state department spokesman matthew miller said on monday : `` the bottom line is hamas need to take that deal and they need to explain to the world and to the palestinian people why they are n't taking it . `` last week , a senior israeli official told u medium that hamas had informed mediator that it did not have 40 living hostage who meet one of the criterion laid out in the latest ceasefire proposal - child , woman , including soldier , men over the age of 50 and those with serious medical condition . a senior hamas official , meanwhile , said it needed a ceasefire to be under way to provide `` enough time and safety `` to locate all the hostage . sheikh mohammed also called on the international community to `` assume it responsibility and stop this war `` , warning that that civilian in gaza faced `` siege and starvation `` , with aid being used a a `` tool for political blackmail `` . a un-backed assessment said last month that 1.1 million people - half the population - were facing catastrophic hunger and that famine wa imminent in northern gaza . the un ha blamed israeli restriction on aid delivery , the ongoing hostility and the breakdown of order . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's office said on wednesday that he `` rejected the claim of international organisation regarding famine in gaza `` and insisted israel wa `` going above and beyond in the humanitarian sphere `` . the israeli military also announced that food aid had entered gaza from israel 's ashdod container port for the first time , with eight un world food programme lorry transporting flour via the israeli-controlled kerem shalom crossing with the south of the territory on wednesday . a new crossing with northern gaza wa also opened last week a israel sought to meet the demand made by u president joe biden following an israeli air strike in gaza on 1 april that killed seven world central kitchen aid worker . `` in the 12 day following my call with prime minister netanyahu , 3,000 truck with food and supply moved into gaza - a daily increase of over 50 % from the week prior , `` mr biden wrote on x , formerly twitter , on wednesday . however , the un agency for palestinian refugee ( unrwa ) , which is the largest humanitarian organisation in gaza , said in a report on tuesday that there had been `` no significant change in the volume of humanitarian supply entering gaza or improved access to the north `` . according to figure published by unrwa , an average of 185 lorry entered gaza per day via kerem shalom and the egyptian-controlled rafah crossing between 5 april - the day after mr biden spoke to mr netanyahu - and 15 april , the latest available date . the daily average wa 168 in the seven day between 29 march and 4 april , according to the data . a senior un humanitarian official also warned on tuesday that it wa still struggling to prevent famine even though there had been some improvement in the co-ordination of aid delivery with israel . `` it 's much bigger than simply bringing in flour and baking a few loaf of bread . it is really complex , `` andrea de domenico noted . `` water , sanitation and health are fundamental to curb famine . `` cogat , the israeli defence ministry body that is co-ordinating aid delivery to gaza , said 700 lorry load of supply were waiting to be collected on the palestinian side of kerem shalom . `` we scaled up our capability . all the un did wa make up excuse , `` it added . in a separate development on the ground in gaza on wednesday , the israeli military said it troop and aircraft had `` eliminated a number of terrorist and destroyed terrorist infrastructure `` in the centre of the territory . palestinian medium reported that there had been intense bombardment and fighting in and around nuseirat refugee camp , where 11 member of the al-nouri family were reportedly killed in a strike on their home on tuesday . the israeli military also said it force had carried out a raid `` to apprehend terrorist hiding in school `` in the northern town of beit hanoun . a number of hamas and palestinian islamic jihad operative were detained and others who resisted were killed , it added . four people were reportedly killed on tuesday when a house in beit hanoun wa hit and significantly damaged , according to the un . one man in neighbouring jabalia told bbc arabic 's gaza lifeline radio service : `` we were shocked by the advance of the occupation [ israeli ] force , which surrounded the entire area and arrested young men , woman and child . the force evacuated u from the area , killed people in beit hanoun , entered the shelter school , and arrested those inside them . `` `` this is how our life ha become unbearable … whenever and wherever we walk , tank always shower u with shell . ``",newspaper headline : israel 's ' tragic ' error and labour ' pro-building ' bid

where armed group backed by iran operate - but it is unclear if they were directly linked to the isfahan strike . the syrian defence ministry said an air defence site in the south of syria had been hit by an israeli missile in the early hour of friday morning local time . israel ha not confirmed it wa behind the strike . isfahan province is a large area in the centre of iran which take it name from it largest city . the region is home to significant iranian military infrastructure , including a large air base , a major missile production complex and several nuclear facility . israel would usually tell the u in advance about military action , but italy 's foreign minister antonio tajani told reporter at the g7 meeting in capri that washington had only been `` informed at the very last minute `` . speaking at the summit , u secretary of state antony blinken refused to be drawn on the attack , saying only that the u had `` not been involved in any offensive operation `` . this latest strike come less than a week after iran launched hundred of missile and drone at israel , an incident seen a a dramatic escalation in tension . despite it vast scale and unprecedented nature , iran 's attack wa largely unsuccessful , with the vast majority of projectile shot down by israeli air defence with the help of the u , uk and other ally . that unprecedented attack on israeli soil wa in response to a strike against a building on an iranian diplomatic compound in syria on 1 april . israel ha not publicly confirmed it wa behind that strike either , but it is widely accepted that it wa . the full significance of this latest strike is still becoming clear and it is not yet known whether iran will seek to respond . bbc security correspondent frank gardener describes the scale of friday 's attack a limited and potentially designed to ensure the conflict go no further . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu will come under competing pressure from some of his own general and political ally to push back against iran , according to bbc international editor jeremy bowen . israel ha come under huge international pressure from the u and other western ally not to take any action which risk turning the long-running proxy war between the two middle east rival into a direct conflict . this flare-up in hostility come against the backdrop of the war in gaza , where the israeli military is fighting iran-backed hamas . some of the response from within israel have highlighted the country 's political division . ultranationalist security minister itamar ben gvir described the strike on iran a `` feeble `` or `` lame `` . in response , israeli opposition leader yair lapid called for him to be sacked , and said his remark had ridiculed and embarrassed israel . the uk government said it would not speculate on the strike , but said israel should avoid `` significant escalation `` while exercising it `` right to self-defence `` . european commission president ursula von der leyen called on all side to refrain from further action . there are concern a worsening conflict in the middle east could disrupt oil supply . brent crude , the international benchmark for oil price , rose by 1.8 % to $ 88 a barrel after the attack . oil price had jumped by a much a 3.5 % initially but the price stabilised when it became clearer the strike wa limited . the price of gold -

2024-04-19T11:59:29.000Z,BBC,"this morning warning siren sounded across northern israel a they do most day . the army said later that it wa a false alarm . but for the people of israel it wa a reminder - if one were needed - of just how fast and how easily iran could retaliate if it wanted to . for north of the border in lebanon lie some 150,000 missile pointed at israel by the iranian-backed militia hezbollah . these are not basic rocket fired out of tube but advanced , accurate and powerful missile that could reach target in israel within minute . and they could be deployed on iran 's instruction at a moment 's notice . and yet despite the reported israeli retaliation against iran , the street of jerusalem were calm , a people went about their business preparing for shabbat . jogger were out in force a usual on the beach of tel aviv . the authority said there wa no change in advice to the public ; there were no instruction for people to head to shelter . this reflected the fact that israel 's air strike on iran appeared initially to be limited in scope and scale . yes , israel had chosen to attack on the birthday of iran 's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , who turned 85 today . but if the strike wa against military target that were perhaps associated with iran 's attack on israel last weekend - such a an airbase or drone factory or missile storage facility - then that could be seen a the restrained response israel 's western ally were looking for . diplomat in europe and the united state feared israel could respond with what is known locally a a `` spectacular `` , a strike perhaps that exceeded the scale of iran 's last weekend that involved more than 300 drone and missile . or perhaps that targeted iran 's nuclear facility . all of which could have triggered a similar iranian retaliation , risking all-out regional war . but instead israel appears to be sending a message to tehran that it can attack deep within iranian territory without restraint . in other word , israel can attack iran 's nuclear facility - not far from the reported location of the strike - but chose not to on this occasion . jonathan conricus , a former idf spokesman , said : `` iran seek to return to the shadow and is downplaying the israeli strike on the strategic city of isfahan , but i think they 've gotten the message : israel can penetrate iranian defence and strike wherever it want . `` by not publicly acknowledging responsibility for the strike - a is commonplace - israel 's war cabinet may hope to make it more difficult for hardline member of the governing coalition to criticise the limited nature of the attack , thus avoiding a political row over passover . but that did not restrain some . israel 's far-right national security minister , itamar ben gvir , said a few day ago he wanted israel to `` go berserk `` in response to iran 's attack . this morning the minister - upon whose faction the prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , depends - seemed less than impressed . on x , the social medium platform formerly known a twitter , he posted one word , best translated a : `` lame . `` israel 's opposition leader , yair lapid , hit back hard at this , posting : `` a security cabinet minister ha never caused such heavy damage to the country 's security , image and international standing . with an unforgivable , one word tweet ben gvir managed to ridicule and embarrass israel all the way from tehran to washington . any other prime minister would have thrown him out of the cabinet this morning . `` there have been report that some ultra-orthodox religious leader had been cautioning the war cabinet about striking without u support , potentially giving mr netanyahu cover for a limited attack on iran . but if this strike is self-contained and not the start of a series of attack , then some israeli will be unsatisfied . after iran 's attack last weekend , i spoke to daniel greenzweig , 65 , a businessman working in the hi-tech sector , who told me : `` we need to hit them and we need to hit them hard . they need to realise that that is not the kind of behaviour that can be tolerated . i am not recommending we destroy their nuclear facility but , if they did , i would n't have a problem with it . `` but not all israeli share that view . in fact , people have appeared divided over whether - and how hard - their government should strike back . an opinion poll published earlier this week by the hebrew university of jerusalem suggested 52 % of people believed israel should not respond , with 48 % saying it should . it also found that only 28 % of people supported military action if it led to a larger overall war , with 34 % saying they were opposed , with a sizeable 38 % saying they did not know . so israel awaits a response from iran . many have woken up with real fear about what could happen next . the risk of miscalculation remains . we do not know yet what further strike on iran - if any - are being considered . i have spoken to international resident in israel who are actively considering evacuating their family . the australian government urged it citizen to leave both israel and the occupied palestinian territory , citing a `` high risk of military reprisal and terrorist attack `` . the u embassy in jerusalem urged american citizen here to be cautious , warning the security environment could change quickly . the people of israel had been preparing for the start of the passover holiday next week . they will now also be waiting to see if and when and how iran decides to retaliate .",israel-gaza briefing : have iran-israel missile strike changed the middle east ? - bbc news

hour of friday morning wa it doing . meanwhile , iran 's military and political leader have downplayed , dismissed and even mocked that anything of consequence happened at all . the account over what kind of weaponry wa deployed on friday and how much damage wa caused are still conflicting and incomplete . american official speak of a missile strike , but iranian official say the attack , in the central province of isfahan and in northwest tabriz , were caused by small exploding drone . `` the downed micro air vehicle caused no damage and no casualty , `` iran 's foreign minister hossein

the one gazan city where it ha not yet launched a ground offensive . it belief that some of the remaining 130-plus hostage snatched from southern israel during the deadly hamas attack on 7 october , which also killed more than 1,200 people , are held there . but prof freilich say for `` the full-on attack that people were talking about you 'd need two thing : to move out all the refugee and then to call up some of those reserve `` . `` between those , it 's at least a couple of week . and now there 's the [ week-long jewish ] passover holiday . `` the u and other ally point out that a large-scale invasion could deepen an already dire humanitarian crisis . amid miserable living condition and the continuous threat to rafah , many gazans stuck there long to return home to the north of the territory . but on monday , israel 's military renewed warning for them not to make the journey , a day after witness said it force had opened fire on crowd heading along a main coastal road . killing five people . the idf did not comment directly on that incident , but an israeli military spokesman said afterwards that palestinian should stay in southern gaza because the north is a `` dangerous combat zone `` . `` we have dreamt of returning home since we left in the early month of the war , `` amr daoudi told u back in rafah . `` but for now we have put it out of our thought . `` more than six month of fighting have flattened vast tract of the north . israel 's restriction on aid have also left some 300,000 who remained there through the war on the brink of famine , according to the united nation . international pressure on israel in the wake of the killing of seven aid worker from u charity world central kitchen on 1 april led to a string of announcement on increasing relief to gaza , notably opening up the ashdod commercial port and a new northern crossing . while aid concern have been overshadowed , in the past week , by fear of a wider regional war , there have been constant update on development - israeli defence official declaring the arrival of shipment of flour destined for newly reopening bakery , for example . anecdotal evidence , including social medium footage of grilled meat being sold in jabalia camp for the first time in month , ha also circulated , suggesting food is becoming more easily available . however , aid agency say that far more need to be done to reverse critical shortage . a the un launched a flash appeal to raise $ 2.8bn ( â£2.3bn ) in funding , mainly for gaza , a senior official from it humanitarian office complained of lingering access problem , particularly to reach the north . `` we are dealing with this dance where we do one step forward , two step backwards ; or two step forward and one step backward , `` say andrea de domenico , who head the un humanitarian office for palestinian territory . if israel 's response to iran 's recent strike is now over , drawing a line under the latest round of violence between these two old enemy , the medium and foreign player are likely to increase their scrutiny of goings-on in gaza once again . already , we got a hint of this when the uk foreign secretary david cameron came to express solidarity with israel and try to reduce tension after the iranian attack of 13-14 april . `` the real need is to refocus back on hamas , back on the hostage , back on getting the aid back in , back on getting a pause in the conflict in gaza , `` he said , ahead of meeting with israeli and palestinian leader . for now , international mediation effort to secure a new truce have largely stalled . the main obstacle remains that israel will discus a temporary halt to bring home hostage but will not stop fighting until hamas is eliminated . hamas say it will not release the hostage without a path to end the war . for ordinary gazans struggling just to survive and israeli desperate to bring home loved one trapped in captivity , the best hope now could come from a new diplomatic thrust . without it there is the threat of a lingering war which carry a huge cost to humanity and constantly risk sparking further destabilising conflict in an already volatile part of the world .",bbc gaza correspondent : my struggle to keep family safe while covering the war -

the charge against him were minor , such a taking part in protest and possessing a firearm , but said he wa also accused of belonging to hamas although there were no specific charge about any activity within the group . ibrahim is still trying to piece together how exactly his brother died . he ha to rely on testimony from abdulrahman 's former cellmates , a well a report from court hearing . one former cellmate , who spoke to the bbc on condition of anonymity , said : `` after 7 october , it wa total torture . they beat u for no reason , they searched u for no reason . even if you look at someone the wrong way . `` he described having seen abdulrahman heavily beaten in front of him and others . `` at 9am , they came into our cell , and began to beat u . one of the guard began to insult abdulrahman 's parent , which he did n't stand for , and he began to fight back . `` they beat him badly , and took him away to another cell upstairs for a week . during that time you could hear him cry out in pain . `` he said he had only found out about abdulrahman 's death after he left prison a week later . the israeli prison service did not directly address the bbc 's question about abdulrahman 's death or those of the 12 other named palestinian that the commission of detainee affair say have died , saying only : `` we are not familiar with the claim described and a far a we know they are not true . `` professor danny rosin , a doctor from the group physician for human right , attended the examination of abdulrahman mari 's body . his remark corroborate what abdulrahman 's cellmate and brother told the bbc . prof rosin 's report mentioned that bruise had been seen over abdulrahman 's left chest , and that he had several broken rib . external bruise were also seen on the back , buttock , left arm and thigh , a well a the right side of the head and neck with no fracture underneath . it also quoted an additional police report which had mentioned `` forceful restraint `` being used on mr mari six day before his death . professor rosin said in the report that while no specific cause of death had been found , `` one may assume that the violence he suffered manifested by the multiple bruise and multiple severe rib fracture contributed to his death `` . he also added that `` irregular pulse `` or a `` heart attack `` could result from these injury without leaving any physical evidence . israel currently hold more than 9,300 security prisoner , the vast majority of whom are palestinian according to the israeli right group hamoked , including more than 3,600 people in administrative detention . these figure do not include detainee from the gaza strip being held in separate facility by the israeli military . mr qadoura say the change after 7 october `` affected every aspect of the prisoner ' life `` , alleging that prisoner have been subjected to starvation and thirst and some of those with chronic illness were denied their medication . beating became more regular and more brutal . `` i met a detainee who 'd lost 20kg in the last three month , `` he said . `` it 's a if the war on gaza wa also a war on palestinian prisoner . it wa all a form of revenge . `` the bbc ha previously heard from palestinian prisoner who described being hit with stick , having muzzled dog set on them and having their clothes , food and blanket taken away in the week after 7 october . the israeli prison service ha denied any mistreatment , saying that `` all prisoner are held in accordance with the law while respecting their basic right and under the supervision of a professional and skilled prison staff `` . it said prison had gone into `` emergency mode `` after war broke out and it had been `` decided to reduce the living condition of the security prisoner `` .

condition of the body , due to prolonged refrigeration , had made it harder to determine the cause of death . he also noted the absence of any record showing if arafat 's diabetes medication had been administered and at what dosing . the report also mentioned the need for other test beyond the post mortem to determine the cause of death . `` until now we do n't know how he died . nothing is clear

site after israeli raid . volker tã¼rk called for independent investigation into the death . palestinian official said they had exhumed 283 body at nasser , some with their hand tied . it is not clear how they died or when they were buried . israel 's military said claim that it buried body there were `` baseless `` . but it did say that during a two-week operation at the hospital in the city of khan younis in february , troop `` examined `` body buried by palestinian `` in place where intelligence indicated the possible presence of hostage `` . testimony from a number of released hostage who were held at nasser hospital place 10 hostage in total there , one of whom remains in captivity . the head of the un human right office for the palestinian territory also said he did not have `` solid evidence `` that body were found in the graf with their hand tied . ajith sunghay told the bbc that while he had seen some photograph of body with hand tied , the evidence did not meet the standard of proof required by the un and so could not be stated a a fact . prior to the israeli operation at nasser , staff there had said they had been forced to bury body in the hospital 's courtyard because nearby fighting prevented access to cemetery , and video were posted on social medium showing burial taking place there . there were similar report from al-shifa before the first israeli raid on the hospital took place in november . the israeli military ha said it ha raided a number of hospital in gaza during the war because hamas fighter have been operating inside them - a claim hamas and medical official have denied . the war began when hamas gunman carried out an unprecedented cross-border attack on southern israel on 7 october , killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilian - and taking 253 others back to gaza a hostage . more than 34,180 people - most of them child and woman - have been killed in gaza since then , the territory 's hamas-run health ministry say . a spokeswoman for the un human right office said on tuesday that it wa working on corroborating report from palestinian official that 283 body had been found in nasser hospital 's ground , including 42 which had been identified . `` victim had reportedly been buried deep in the ground and covered with waste , `` ravina shamdasani told reporter in geneva . `` among the deceased were allegedly older people , woman and wounded , while others . . . were found with their hand tied and stripped of their clothes . `` mr tã¼rk called for independent , effective and transparent investigation into the death , adding : `` given the prevailing climate of impunity , this should include international investigator . `` `` hospital are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law . and the intentional killing of civilian , detainee , and others who are hors de combat [ not participating in hostility ] is a war crime . `` the u state department also said the report were `` incredibly troubling `` . on monday , a spokesman for the hamas-run civil defense force told bbc arabic 's gaza today programme that it had received report from local palestinian that the body of a `` large number `` of people who had been killed during the war and buried in a makeshift cemetery in the hospital 's courtyard were moved to another location during the israeli raid . `` after research and investigation , we learned that the occupation [ israeli ] army had established a mass grave , pulled out the body that were in nasser hospital , and buried them in this mass grave , `` mahmoud basal said . gaza today also spoke to a man who said he wa searching there for the body of two male relative which he alleged had been taken by israeli troop during israel 's recently concluded offensive in khan younis . `` after i had buried them in an apartment , the [ israeli ] came and moved their body , `` he said . `` every day we search for their body , but we fail to find them . `` hamas ha alleged that the body include people `` executed in cold blood `` by israeli force , without providing evidence . the israel defense force ( idf ) said in a statement on tuesday : `` the claim that the idf buried palestinian body is baseless and unfounded . `` `` during the idf 's operation in the area of nasser hospital , in accordance to the effort to locate hostage and missing person , corps buried by palestinian in the area of nasser hospital were examined . `` the examination wa conducted in a careful manner and exclusively in place where intelligence indicated the possible presence of hostage . the examination wa carried out respectfully while maintaining the dignity of the deceased . body examined , which did not belong to israeli hostage , were returned to their place . `` the idf said that it force had detained `` about 200 terrorist who were in the hospital `` during the raid , and that they found ammunition a well a unused medicine intended for israeli hostage . it also insisted that the raid wa carried out `` in a targeted manner and without harming the hospital , the patient and the medical staff `` . however , three medical staff told the bbc last month that they were humiliated , beaten , doused with cold water , and forced to kneel for hour after being detained during the raid . medic who remained at nasser after the israeli takeover said they were unable to care for patient and that 13 died because of condition there , including a lack of water , electricity and other supply . on 1 april , israeli troop withdrew from al-shifa hospital , which is in gaza city , following what the idf said wa another `` precise `` operation carried out in response to intelligence that hamas had regrouped there . the idf said at the time that 200 `` terrorist `` were killed in and around the hospital during the two-week raid . more than 500 others were detained , and weapon and intelligence were found `` throughout the hospital `` , it added . after a mission gained access to the facility five day later , the world health organization ( who ) said al-shifa wa `` now an empty shell `` , with most of the building extensively damaged or destroyed , and the majority of equipment unusable or reduced to ash . it also said that `` numerous shallow graf `` had been dug just outside the emergency department , and the administrative and surgical building , and that `` many dead body were partially buried with their limb visible `` . the idf also said it had avoided harm to patient at al-shifa . but the who cited the acting hospital director a saying patient were held in abysmal condition during the siege , and that at least 20 patient reportedly died due to a lack of access to care and limited movement authorised for medic . spokeswoman m shamdasani said report seen by the un human right office suggested that a total of 30 body were buried in the two graf and that 12 of them had been identified so far . `` there are report that the hand of some of these body were also tied , `` she said , adding that `` many more `` people could have been killed than the 200 reported by the idf . gaza 's civil defence spokesman told cnn on 9 april that 381 body had been recovered from the vicinity of al-shifa , but that the figure did not include people buried in the hospital 's ground . the un human right chief also deplored a `` beyond warfare `` a series of israeli strike on the southern city of rafah in the past few day , which he said had killed mostly woman and child . the strike included one on saturday night , after which a premature baby wa delivered from the womb of her pregnant mother , who wa killed along with her husband and other daughter . mr tã¼rk also again warned against a full-scale israeli ground assault on rafah , where 1.5 million displaced civilian are sheltering , saying it would lead to further breach of international humanitarian law and human right law . in response , the idf said it wa `` operating to dismantle hamas military and administrative capability `` . `` in stark contrast to hamas ' intentional attack on israeli men , woman and child , the idf follows international law and take feasible precaution to mitigate civilian harm , `` it added .",southern lebanon : bbc see air strike destruction in deserted town - bbc news

about seven of u - lived on one meal a day . even when there wa food , sometimes we did not eat it because there wa hardly anywhere to go to the toilet . during this time my friend , al jazeera bureau chief wael al-dahdouh , suffered a terrible loss . the house his family had been staying in wa hit in an israeli air strike . his wife , teenage son , seven-year-old daughter and one-year-old grandson were killed . the israeli military say it take `` feasible precaution `` to reduce civilian casualty , and in this case had `` targeted hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area `` . reporting gaza : my war in gaza , palestinian journalist document the war a they live it on a daily basis . in this bbc world service film , we hear the story of bbc arabic 's reporter in gaza , adnan el-bursh who found himself reporting the news , a he wa living through it . watch now on bbc iplayer ( uk only ) or on the bbc world service youtube channel ( outside uk ) i watched the footage of my friend , who i have known for 20 year , embracing his child 's shroud-wrapped body in central gaza . i wished i wa there with him . the news came amid a string of report about the death of other friend , relative and neighbour . my heart ached . i have now lost about 200 people in the war . that day i wept live on air , a i wa reporting . in the night , i woke up with tear covering my cheek . wael 's image never left my mind . i have covered conflict in gaza for 15 year , but this war stand apart , from the unprecedented attack that triggered it , to the scale of the loss . at 06:15 on 7 october i wa woken by loud explosion and my child screaming . i went up to the rooftop and saw rocket being launched towards israel from gaza . when we realised hamas had breached the fence into israel -

2024-05-07T18:51:50.000Z,BBC,"after month of stalemate , the search for peace in gaza ha reached a critical stage . un chief antonio guterres say it is a `` decisive moment for the palestinian and israeli people and for the fate of the entire region `` . there seems to be common ground between most side about the principle : a ceasefire should take place alongside the release of israeli hostage and palestinian prisoner . various draft agreement have been drawn up , setting out a complex process of how it would all work . there is some disagreement over the detail of what should happen to whom and when and in what order . israeli official say , for example , that it female soldier should be released earlier than envisaged . they also say the text should be clearer that the first 33 hostage to be released must be alive and are worried about not having a veto over which palestinian prisoner would be released . these are issue that could potentially be surmounted through negotiation . but there is a more fundamental sticking point about a core principle that may be harder to get past and that is when the war should end . the opening word of the draft agreement - supported by hamas - declares that there should be a `` temporary cessation of military operation between the two party `` . this is largely unproblematic . six week would pas while people are released , israeli force withdraw from some area , displaced gazans would be able to return to what if anything is left of their home . but then stage two would begin . the draft agreement then talk about a `` return to sustainable calm `` , which it defines a `` a permanent cessation of military and hostile operation `` . it is this that seems to be unacceptable to israel 's government . in a statement , the prime minister benjamin netanyahu said : `` israel will not allow hamas to restore it evil rule in the gaza strip , israel will not allow it to restore it military capability to continue striving for our destruction . israel can not accept a proposal that endangers the security of our citizen and the future of our country . `` in other word , israel 's government want the right to continue taking the fight to hamas in the long run . by contrast , hamas want a permanent ceasefire . what is not clear is whether there is a way for qatari , egyptian and american negotiator to find a middle path through this . it may be that all of this is part of the negotiation . public statement are frequently used in negotiation to put pressure on the other side . the announcement by hamas that it support a particular draft could be an attempt to push israel into making concession and divide it from it ally . israel 's warning about an imminent military operation in rafah could be an attempt to extract better term from hamas . but the question of whether any ceasefire is permanent or not look hard to square with clever diplomatic language . israel ha agreed to send a delegation to cairo but with modest ambition - not to hammer out a deal but `` to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under condition acceptable to israel `` . much will depend on what the u government decides . so far , u spokespeople have fallen over themselves to avoid making any comment on the deal hamas ha signed up to . they have limited themselves to asserting that an agreement is still `` achievable `` and to warning firmly against a military operation in rafah . that is because if the u were to throw it weight behind the current text , then mr netanyahu might be forced to choose between his main ally and the ultra-nationalist hardliner propping up his government who oppose any compromise . mr netanyahu ha survived many crisis in his political career by postponing difficult decision . but president biden ha it in his gift to force israel 's leader to make a choice that he might rather avoid .",party pressed over funding of election pledge

a place which is supposed to be the ultimate safe space . `` the bbc understands that the hospital concerned is investigating all aspect of the case , including the antisemitism allegation . from the start of 2023 , the gmc received eight complaint about antisemitism by doctors.however , in the four month after the hamas attack , 60 medical professional were reported for alleged antisemitic conduct or remark against their colleague across the uk . of these 60 complaint , 22 are currently undergoing `` triage `` , a process where the gmc determines whether a complaint should proceed to a full investigation . according to the gmc , 1,903 doctor identified a jewish in 2023 , the most recent data available . this is roughly 1 % of licensed doctor in the uk . the gmc figure , obtained via a freedom of information request by the bbc , also show an uptick in complaint about islamophobia by doctor since 7 october , with 16 case from october through to january compared to three in the preceding nine month . there are 53,359 doctor in the uk who identify a muslim -

the one part of society where we expect everybody to behave with complete professionalism and neutrality . `` dr rich said his organisation had received `` quite unusual `` report from jewish medic about `` thing either said to them , or posted online , or other kind of antisemitic behaviour from colleague `` in recent month . he called it `` really disappointing to see this playing out `` in the wake of an overseas conflict.dr rich said jewish medical professional were being singled out by their colleague simply due to their identity . `` the vast majority of incident that we record involve visibly jewish people or jewish organisation being singled out simply because they are jewish , and either harassed or threatened , or treated a if they are somehow to blame or responsible for anything israel ha done , simply because they are jewish , `` dr rich said . the jewish medical association 's prof david katz accused the gmc of being `` sluggish `` and `` unclear `` over it criterion for determining and resolving case of alleged antisemitism.he belief the reported incident are `` just the tip of the iceberg `` , with some jewish doctor hesitant to come forward . `` there 's a question that the wish to avoid identifying yourself too publicly a jewish remains a strong one , which reflects maybe a little on the nature of the underlying host society , `` prof katz said . the professional standard authority , which oversees the gmc , ha previously been warned by health secretary victoria atkins that it is `` vital for public confidence `` that `` any instance of extremism , discrimination or hate speech are dealt with in a thorough and timely manner `` . a gmc spokesperson told the bbc : `` we recognise the significant impact the ongoing conflict ha on member of the profession , patient , and all those affected . `` since october 2023 we have received a high volume of complaint about doctor ’ comment on social medium related to ongoing conflict in gaza . `` doctor are entitled to personal belief , and there is nothing preventing doctor from exercising their right to speak about or campaign on issue , but this must not affect their relationship with patient or the treatment they provide or arrange . `` our guidance is clear that discrimination is not compatible with the responsibility and duty of a doctor . `` get in touch : do you have a story you 'd like bbc london 's investigation team to look into ? get in touch , in confidence on : londoninvestigationsteam @ bbc.co.uk",u college protest : hundred more arrested across u in gaza campus protest

crucial to preventing the build-up of sewage and the spread of disease - have been damaged or destroyed . the two others have shut down because lack of fuel or other supply , according to one aid agency . the plant were among more than 600 water and sanitation facility that we analysed , using a list of location provided by gaza 's coastal municipality water utility ( cmwu ) . in one satellite image , of khan younis in the south of gaza , two damaged large water storage tank can be seen . the destruction of water and sanitation facility ha led to `` disastrous health consequence for the population `` , said dr natalie robert , executive director of medecins sans frontieres uk . `` the rate of diarrhoeal disease have gone catastrophically high , `` she said . in very severe case , such disease can kill young child and the vulnerable . rate of hepatitis a - found in contaminated water and particularly dangerous for pregnant woman - are also high , according to the charity . `` this is killing people , `` dr robert said . there is a particular spike in disease in rafah in the south where many gazans have fled to , dr robert said , and a risk of cholera . there ha been widespread damage to building across gaza since hamas attacked israel on 7 october . according to the un , about 69,000 housing unit have been destroyed and a further 290,000 damaged . home are now `` very unlikely `` to have running water , according to aid worker we spoke to . to carry out this analysis we sought advice from expert at the un and human right watch on the best approach . for each site , we sourced the most recent high resolution satellite imagery and compared each shot with an image taken prior to 7 october . we then marked a facility a destroyed or damaged if the closest structure to the given co-ordinate appeared to be reduced to rubble , partially collapsed , or showed other sign of damage . bbc verify ha not distinguished between `` destroyed `` and `` damaged `` facility . this is because without knowing the precise outline of each facility , we can not say whether it ha been partly damaged or completely destroyed . water well usually consist of an underground borehole and electric pump , together with a small control room above ground . however , a the control room is not always visible or easily identifiable we had to rely on analysing the nearest visible building when assessing damage . of the 603 water facility we analysed , 53 % appeared to have been damaged or destroyed since 7 october . a further 43 facility were in area that showed some damage or where solar panel had been removed , but we were unable to determine whether the water facility itself had been damaged so these were not included in our analysis . the latest available satellite image were acquired in march and april , and our analysis ha been ongoing since april . the majority of site identified a destroyed or damaged are in northern gaza or in the area around the southern city of khan younis . at one wastewater facility in bureij , in the centre of the strip , solar panel that power the plant had been obliterated and sewage treatment tank appeared to have algae growing on the surface . not all damage is visible from satellite image , so our analysis may have missed some affected facility . some site also may not be fully operational due to a lack of fuel . for example , the unicef desalination plant in deir al-balah -

that any attempt to blunt the threat of an israeli assault on rafah would benefit hamas.the running detail of the talk are , however , mostly opaque , making it hard to definitively assess the claim . the biggest stumbling block is over hamas ’ demand for a permanent end to the war , which israel rejects.the relationship between mr biden and mr netanyahu go back five decade , and ha been turbulent for just a long.when they were both young men , mr biden said he signed a picture which later sat on mr netanyahu ’ s desk , writing : “ bibi , i love you , but i don ’ t agree with a damn thing you have to say . ” mr netanyahu ha often praised the president for his support of israel , but they have fallen out frequently over major policy issue relating to the palestinians.less than a fortnight after the october 7 attack , mr biden flew to israel and embraced mr netanyahu on the tarmac in tel aviv . i wa there a mr biden emerged from a meeting with the israeli leader and his war cabinet and stood at a podium to assert his unstinting support for israel . but he had a warning : don ’ t repeat the mistake we made after the 9/11 attack . and he spelled out what he meant : “ the palestinian people are suffering greatly a well , and we mourn the loss of innocent palestinian life like the entire world . ” mr biden ’ s wartime trip take on further significance in hindsight : the start of an attempt to prevent a near unprecedented break in the us-israel relationship , which inched closer this week.on thursday , the day after mr biden announced the weapon shipment pause , mr netanyahu fired back . the prime minister ha long understood that he can rally his own base with show of defiance to u pressure . “ if we need to stand alone , we will stand alone . i have said that if necessary we will fight with our fingernail , ” he said.i put mr netanyahu ’ s statement to chris coon , the democratic senator . “ they do n't need to fight with their fingernail , ” he said . “ they will and should fight with modern weapon system that they have developed in many case jointly with u , that are provided in many case by u . ” “ but they should do it in a way that minimises civilian casualty , ” he said .",alarm in israel at report of possible icc legal action over gaza

2024-05-14T11:46:08.000Z,BBC,"reporter always carry some kind of baggage with them when they head off to cover a story - whether it 's the tool of their trade , a camera or a microphone , or something less tangible , such a memory of a past encounter or story . it wa on a recent deployment that the bbc 's middle east analyst sebastian usher suddenly noticed that the often unwanted companion that seemingly always accompanied him on trip abroad had suddenly gone missing . i got back from a reporting trip to jerusalem , with all the usual high and low , and with the backdrop of one of the world 's most utterly enthralling city . and i realised on my return that something that habitually accompanies me on such trip had been missing . something that i have always somewhat resented , yet also jealously guarded a an essential part of who i am . my stutter . even after all these year it is almost always there , just giving a little wave a i prepare to do the umpteenth live interview . it 's mostly very well-behaved these day and surprisingly flexible , even generous . at one time , it would let me know that a certain word - say , `` syria `` - wa a no-go . that wa fair and mostly allowed me a way around it . it had no objection , for instance , to `` syrian territory `` or the `` syrian region `` . having to find fresh phrase can be an asset for a reporter . so it wa perfectly liveable-with and to be honest - after a lifetime of listening to that little voice - quite companionable . but high up on the windswept bureau balcony in jerusalem , the voice wa silent . there have been time like this before , and it ha always returned . but who know - this time it might be for good . and it make me feel a little bereft . when i look back , i ca n't really remember how it started but i do know that it wa - to me at least - a relatively unobtrusive part of my childhood . i wa lucky to have a relatively sheltered , privileged upbringing where if it wa noted at all , it wa seen a a vaguely charming mark of distinction . a musty old classic teacher would tell me about the great athenian rhetorician demosthenes standing on the beach with stone in his mouth to cure his stutter . it did n't really appeal . any time there wa some distance that needed to be bridged - like speaking on a phone or asking for a bus ticket - it could be a problem . anything too formal , too . and i found early on that it wa really a stammer , not a stutter . word did n't fracture and become staccato . they simply sat in the path like great unblinking toad , slyly preventing anything from getting past . but a stutter always sounded classier to me , so i 've stuck with that . it 's been everywhere with me - at school , university , work . it 's been quite remarkably even-handed in showing up in formal or casual situation . and utterly capricious , suddenly coming up with an entirely new syllable or consonant to place out of bound . people would ask : is it nerve ? are you very anxious ? which would of course give me anxiety - so i never mentioned it . this meant that if suddenly , halfway through a sentence , i wa struck dumb , people would react a if it were some biblical curse . once in jordan after a 12-hour bus journey through the endless scrubland from riyadh , i wa suddenly unable to sound out a single word , a great imaginary boulder having materialised on my tongue through the night . across the middle east , beyond the endless strife and complication , certain thing were at least clear to me - `` lebanon `` wa no problem , `` iraq `` and `` iran `` were easy - `` israel `` too - `` egypt `` a doddle - but `` tunisia `` , `` tel aviv `` and `` turkey `` were temperamental , withdrawing access at a moment 's notice . i would try to avoid listening to a fellow correspondent on the same story before going on air , in case my inner voice should triumphantly extricate the key word from their report and place it in quarantine . that voice ha however become ever more forgiving and forbearing down the year ; now it is mostly a whisper of itself . but it 's never gone away - or so i thought . maybe i wa just holding onto it a a precious fragment of a long-lost self - a sense that there wa always something latent and untapped that lay beyond the surface . a connection - semi secret - to entire world of people that were gone . a she sank ever deeper into alzheimer 's , my mother , who had helped make it so that i never felt it a burden or a hindrance , simply denied outright that my stutter had ever existed - a last link broken with the past . perhaps it 's her gentleness and elegant humour that the trace of sudden silence on my tongue still keep alive . or did . so , the next time i am lost for word , it may simply be because there are none left to convey what is happening in gaza , israel and beyond .",uk flood hit vegetable supply with carrot imported from israel

which currently stand at more than 35,000 - ha not changed , but the un now say incomplete information ha led to the revision . the un say it is now relying on figure from the hamas-run health ministry in gaza , rather than from the hamas-run government medium office ( gmo ) . the israeli foreign minister highlighted the un 's change , calling the lower reported death toll for woman and child `` the miraculous resurrection of the dead in gaza `` and accusing the un of relying on `` fake data from a terrorist organisation `` . the figure have been released in different way by the two separate authority - the gmo and the health ministry - and the un ha now switched from quoting the former to the latter to break down demographic data . at the start of the war the health ministry only reported death for which detail had been registered in hospital , whereas from november , the gmo included an additional category of death recorded in `` reliable medium report `` . more recently the health ministry ha included these medium report compiled by the gmo , along with an additional category of death recorded by family member by filling in an online form . gaza 's health ministry is now therefore reporting these figure : some of these for which information is missing ( such a an id number or date of birth ) are included in the overall number of death in the health ministry figure , but are not broken down demographically . the number of woman and child killed is deeply contested because it is often interpreted a an indication of the number of civilian death . in a recent interview , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said about 30,000 people had been killed in gaza , with 14,000 of them being `` terrorist `` and 16,000 civilian . he did not provide any evidence for those figure . keeping precise record of casualty during wartime is challenging , so it is therefore not unusual for the number reported to vary , according to prof erica charter who specialises in the study of war . the initial figure for how many people were killed in hamas 's 7 october attack wa originally put at 1,400 by israeli authority , but wa later revised down to about 1,200 . at the time , the israeli authority said the misidentification of some of the burnt body wa the reason for the discrepancy . the gmo ha consistently given a higher figure for the proportion of woman and child in all fatality than ha the health ministry . on 6 may , the un reported 34,735 death -

this is where the dispute over what the court actually meant then took off.in april , some 600 british lawyer including four former supreme court justice , signed a letter to the uk prime minister , asking him to stop arm sale to israel and referring to “ a plausible risk of genocide ” . that triggered a counter-letter from uk lawyer for israel ( uklfi ) . the 1,300-strong group said the icj had only ruled that gaza palestinian had a plausible right to be protected from genocide - in other word , that it had been dealing with a complex and somewhat abstract legal argument.the dispute continued in more letter and interpretations.many in the first group described uklfi ’ s interpretation a “ empty wordplay ” . the court , they argued , can not have been solely concerned with an academic question - because the stake were far higher than that.and , of all place , the debate crystallised in legal sparring before a uk parliamentary committee , debating the question of arm export to israel.lord sumption , a former uk supreme court justice , told the committee : “ i think it is being suggested [ in the uklfi letter ] that all that the icj wa doing wa accepting , a a matter of abstract law , that the inhabitant of gaza had a right not to be subjected to genocide . i have to say that i regard that proposition a barely arguable . ” not so , responded natasha hausdorff of uk lawyer for israel . “ i respectfully insist that reading a finding of plausible risk that israel is committing genocide disregard the court ’ s unambiguous statement , ” she replied.a day later , joan donoghue - now retired from the icj - appeared on the bbc ’ s hardtalk programme and explicitly tried to end the debate by setting out what the court had done . “ it did not decide - and this is something where i 'm correcting what 's often said in the medium . . . that the claim of genocide wa plausible , ” said the judge . “ it did emphasise in the order that there wa a risk of irreparable harm to the palestinian right to be protected from genocide . but the shorthand that often appears , which is that there 's a plausible case of genocide , is n't what the court decided . ” whether there is any evidence of such terrible harm is a question the court is far from deciding .",gaza protest : oxford and cambridge university student set up camp

and began looking into - a similar pattern of behaviour in the west bank , which ha experienced a spike in violence over the same period . despite the bbc 's previous reporting on israeli soldier ' social medium misconduct , and the military 's subsequent promise to act on our finding , a former israeli soldier , ori givati , say he is far from shocked to hear that this activity is continuing . a spokesperson for breaking the silence - an organisation for former and serving israeli soldier which work to expose alleged wrongdoing in the israel defense force ( idf ) - mr givati added that in fact he believed current far-right political rhetoric in the country is encouraging it further . `` there are no repercussion . they [ israeli soldier ] get encouraged and supported by the highest minister of the government , `` he said . and he say this play into a mindset that the military already subscribes to . `` the culture in the military , when it come to palestinian , is that they are only target . they are not human being . this is how the military teach you to behave . `` israel ha built about 160 settlement housing some 700,000 jew since it occupied the west bank and east jerusalem -

like the uk , u and other country - proscribes hamas a a terrorist organisation . in one video , mr ben , who ha also served with idf force in gaza , mock two detained palestinian , ordering them to say : `` am yisrael chai `` , meaning `` the people of israel live `` . ori dahbash is another member of the same battalion who ha posted footage of military operation in the west bank , including a photo of a detainee that ha also been shared by mr vazana . expert said the footage posted by the soldier could violate international law . dr mark elli , executive director of the international bar association , called for an investigation into the incident in the footage , and for the idf to discipline the soldier involved . international human right lawyer sir geoffrey nice , who worked with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia ( icty ) between 1998 and 2006 , agreed with dr elli , but wa sceptical anyone would be held to account for their action . in response to our investigation , the idf replied : `` the idf hold it soldier to a professional standard … and investigates when behavior is not in line with the idf 's value . in the event of unacceptable behavior , soldier were disciplined and even suspended from reserve duty . `` additionally , soldier are instructed to avoid uploading footage of operational activity to social medium network . `` the idf 's response did not acknowledge that it had pledged to act on our earlier finding on similar social medium misconduct , in gaza . mr givati , former israeli commander in the west bank , said he felt ashamed and disgusted by israeli soldier ' treatment of detainee . `` we should treat them with the same dignity that we would like to be treated with , `` he told the bbc . he said the behaviour reflected how he felt israeli society view palestinian , and called into question it claim to abide by international law . `` we have no future a a society if we continue behaving this way , `` he said . what do you want bbc verify to investigate ?",‘ sustainable calm ’ proposal split israel and hamas

they will hope the end of his rule hastens the end of this regime.for iran ’ s ruling conservative , the state funeral will be an occasion freighted with emotion ; it will also be an opportunity to start sending their signal of continuity.they know the world is watching . “ for 40 some year , in western narrative , iran wa supposed to collapse and fall apart , `` professor mohammed marandi of tehran university told the bbc . `` but somehow , miraculously , it 's still here and i predict it will still be here in year to come . ” another critical position which must be filled is the seat held by this middle-ranking cleric on the assembly of expert , the body empowered to choose the new supreme leader , when that far more consequential transition come . “ raisi wa a potential successor because , like khamenei himself when he became supreme leader , he wa relatively young , very loyal , an ideologue committed to the system who ha name recognition , ” say dr vakil of this opaque process of selection , where a number of name are seen to be in the running including the supreme leader ’ s son mojtaba khamenei.even before raisi ’ s death wa officially confirmed , the ayatollah conveyed in a post on x that “ the iranian people should not worry , there will be no disruption in the country ’ s affair . ” the more immediate political challenge will be staging early presidential election . power ha been transferred to vice-president mohammad mokhber ; new election must be held within 50 days.this appeal to voter will come just month after march ’ s parliamentary election revealed a record low turnout in a country which once prided itself on strong enthusiastic participation in this exercise . recent election , including the contest in 2021 which brought raisi to the presidency , were also marked by the systematic exclusion of moderate and pro-reform rival by the oversight body . “ early presidential election could provide khamenei and the upper echelon of the state with an opportunity to reverse that trajectory to give voter a way back into the political process , ” say mohammad ali shabani , editor of london-based news website amwaj.media . “ but , unfortunately , so far we have seen no indication of the state being ready and willing to take such a step . ” but , even within raisi ’ s rank , there appears to be no obvious successor . “ there are different camp within this conservative group , including individual who are more hardline and others regarded a more pragmatic , ” point out hamidreza azizi , a visiting fellow at swp , the berlin-based think tank . he belief this will intensify the current jockeying for position within the new parliament and at local levels.whoever assumes raisi ’ s mantle inherits a forbidding agenda and limited lever of power.ultimate decision-making authority in the islamic republic lie with the supreme leader . foreign policy , especially in the region , is the preserve of the islamic revolution guard corp ( irgc ) who wield growing power.the president didn ’ t call the shot month ago when iran confronted unprecedented tension with it arch-enemy israel over the devastating israel gaza war . it triggered a dangerous tit-for-tat and set alarm bell ringing in many capital , most of all tehran , over the potential for an even riskier escalatory spiral.but a he presided over day-to-day business , iranian struggled to cope with deepening financial hardship linked to crippling international sanction a well a mismanagement and corruption . inflation soared to more than 40 % ;

holit ; the location of the supernova music festival ; be ’ eri ; nir oz ; and nahal oz . the investigation also relies on evidence such a cctv footage , authenticated audio , photo and video material , statement by hamas member including the alleged perpetrator named above , and expert evidence . `` it is the view of my office that these individual planned and instigated the commission of crime on 7 october 2023 , and have through their own action , including personal visit to hostage shortly after their kidnapping , acknowledged their responsibility for those crime . we submit that these crime could not have been committed without their action . they are charged both a co-perpetrators and a superior pursuant to article 25 and 28 of the rome statute . `` during my own visit to kibbutz be ’ eri and kibbutz kfar aza , a well a to the site of supernova music festival in re ’ im , i saw the devastating scene of these attack and the profound impact of the unconscionable crime charged in the application filed today . speaking with survivor , i heard how the love within a family , the deepest bond between a parent and a child , were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness . these act demand accountability . `` my office also submits there are reasonable ground to believe that hostage taken from israel have been kept in inhumane condition , and that some have been subject to sexual violence , including rape , while being held in captivity . we have reached that conclusion based on medical record , contemporaneous video and documentary evidence , and interview with victim and survivor . my office also continues to investigate report of sexual violence committed on 7 october . `` i wish to express my gratitude to the survivor , and the family of victim of the 7 october attack , for their courage in coming forward to provide their account to my office . we remain focused on further deepening our investigation of all crime committed a part of these attack and will continue to work with all partner to ensure that justice is delivered . `` i again reiterate my call for the immediate release of all hostage taken from israel and for their safe return to their family . this is a fundamental requirement of international humanitarian law . `` `` benjamin netanyahu , yoav gallant '' on the basis of evidence collected and examined by my office , i have reasonable ground to believe that benjamin netanyahu , the prime minister of israel , and yoav gallant , the minister of defence of israel , bear criminal responsibility for the following war crime and crime against humanity committed on the territory of the state of palestine ( in the gaza strip ) from at least 8 october 2023 : starvation of civilian a a method of warfare a a war crime contrary to article 8 ( 2 ) ( b ) ( xxv ) of the statute ;

obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian agency ; and attack on and killing of aid worker , which forced many agency to cease or limit their operation in gaza . `` my office submits that these act were committed a part of a common plan to use starvation a a method of war and other act of violence against the gazan civilian population a a mean to ( i ) eliminate hamas ; ( ii ) secure the return of the hostage which hamas ha abducted , and ( iii ) collectively punish the civilian population of gaza , whom they perceived a a threat to israel . `` the effect of the use of starvation a a method of warfare , together with other attack and collective punishment against the civilian population of gaza are acute , visible and widely known , and have been confirmed by multiple witness interviewed by my office , including local and international medical doctor . they include malnutrition , dehydration , profound suffering and an increasing number of death among the palestinian population , including baby , other child , and woman . `` famine is present in some area of gaza and is imminent in other area . a un secretary-general antónio guterres warned more than two month ago , “ 1.1 million people in gaza are facing catastrophic hunger – the highest number of people ever recorded – anywhere , anytime ” a a result of an “ entirely man-made disaster ” . today , my office seek to charge two of those most responsible , netanyahu and gallant , both a co-perpetrators and a superior pursuant to article 25 and 28 of the rome statute . `` israel , like all state , ha a right to take action to defend it population . that right , however , doe not absolve israel or any state of it obligation to comply with international humanitarian law . notwithstanding any military goal they may have , the mean israel chose to achieve them in gaza – namely , intentionally causing death , starvation , great suffering , and serious injury to body or health of the civilian population – are criminal . `` since last year , in ramallah , in cairo , in israel and in rafah , i have consistently emphasised that international humanitarian law demand that israel take urgent action to immediately allow access to humanitarian aid in gaza at scale . i specifically underlined that starvation a a method of war and the denial of humanitarian relief constitute rome statute offence . i could not have been clearer . `` a i also repeatedly underlined in my public statement , those who do not comply with the law should not complain later when my office take action . that day ha come . `` `` in presenting these application for arrest warrant , my office is acting pursuant to it mandate under the rome statute . on 5 february 2021 , pre-trial chamber i decided that the court can exercise it criminal jurisdiction in the situation in the state of palestine and that the territorial scope of this jurisdiction extends to gaza and the west bank , including east jerusalem . this mandate is ongoing and includes the escalation of hostility and violence since 7 october 2023 . my office also ha jurisdiction over crime committed by national of state party and by the national of non-states party on the territory of a state party . `` today ’ s application are the outcome of an independent and impartial investigation by my office . guided by our obligation to investigate incriminating and exonerating evidence equally , my office ha worked painstakingly to separate claim from fact and to soberly present conclusion based on evidence to the pre-trial chamber . `` a an additional safeguard , i have also been grateful for the advice of a panel of expert in international law , an impartial group i convened to support the evidence review and legal analysis in relation to these arrest warrant application . the panel is composed of expert of immense standing in international humanitarian law and international criminal law , including sir adrian fulford pc , former lord justice of appeal and former international criminal court judge ;

the parallel of the prosecutor between the terrorist organization hamas and the state of israel is despicable and disgusting . `` he said in a post on x.before adding : `` the state of israel is not a party to the court and doe not recognize it authority . `` the outrage expressed by the prime minister , and echoed by israel ’ s political leadership , wa generated by page of carefully chosen legal language in a statement issued by mr khan , the icc chief prosecutor who is a british king ’ s counsel . word by word , line by line , they add up to a devastating series of allegation against the three most prominent leader of hamas a well a israel ’ s prime minister and defence minister.a determination to apply international law and the law of armed conflict to all party , no matter who they are , lie at the heart of mr khan ’ s statement in which he lay out his justification for requesting arrest warrant . `` no foot soldier , no commander , no civilian leader - no one - can act with impunity . `` the law , he say , can not be applied selectively . if that happens , `` we will be creating condition for it collapse `` . it is the decision to hold both side ’ conduct up to the template of international law that is causing so much anger , and not just in israel . u president joe biden said it wa `` outrageous `` to apply for arrest warrant . there wa `` no equivalence - none - between israel and hamas `` . hamas demanded the withdrawal of the allegation against it leader , claiming that the icc ’ s prosecutor wa `` equating the victim with the executioner `` . it said the request to issue arrest warrant for the israeli leadership came seven month too late , after `` the israeli occupation committed thousand of crime `` . mr khan doe not make direct comparison between the two side , except to lay out his claim that they have both committed a series of war crime and crime against humanity . he also emphasis that this latest war come in the context of `` an international armed conflict between israel and palestine , and a non-international armed conflict between israel and hamas `` . the court treat palestine a a state a it ha observer status at the united nation , which meant it wa able to sign up to the rome statute which created the icc . mr netanyahu ha declared that palestinian will never have independence on his watch . instead of seeing disgraceful and false parallel between , a israel ’ s president isaac herzog put it , `` these atrocious terrorist and a democratically elected government of israel `` , human right group have applauded the way that the icc prosecutor is seeking to apply the law to both side . b'tselem , a leading israeli human right organisation , said the warrant marked `` israel ’ s rapid decline into a moral abyss `` . `` the international community is signalling to israel that it can no longer maintain it policy of violence , killing and destruction without accountability , `` it added.human right campaigner have complained for many year that powerful western country , led by the u , turn a blind eye to israeli violation of international law , even a they condemn and sanction other state who are not in their camp . the action being taken by mr khan and his team are , they believe , long overdue.mr khan say that the three main leader of hamas committed war crime that include extermination , murder , hostage-taking , rape and torture . the men named are yahya sinwar , the hamas leader in gaza , mohammed deif , the commander of the qassam brigade , it military wing , and ismail haniyeh , head of the hamas political bureau.as part of their investigation , karim khan and his team interviewed victim and survivor of the 7 october attack . he said hamas had assaulted fundamental human value : `` the love within a family , the deepest bond between a parent and a child were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness `` . israel , mr khan said , doe have the right to defend itself . but `` unconscionable crime `` did not `` absolve israel of it obligation to comply with international humanitarian law `` . the failure to do that , he said , justified issuing warrant for the arrest of mr netanyahu and defence minister yoav gallant for crime including starvation of civilian a a weapon of war , murder , extermination , and intentional attack on civilian . from the start of israel ’ s response to the hamas attack of 7 october , president biden ha issued a series of rebuke to israel , expressing concern that it wa killing too many palestinian civilian and destroying too much civilian infrastructure in gaza . but in a careful balancing act with a close ally which he ha always supported , mr biden and his administration have not spelt out in public about what they mean.mr khan make his interpretation crystal clear . israel , he say , ha chosen criminal mean to achieve it war aim in gaza - `` namely , intentionally causing death , starvation , great suffering , and serious injury `` to civilians.a panel of judge at the icc now will consider whether to issue the arrest warrant . state signed up to the icc ’ s rome statute would then be obliged to detain the men if they had the chance . the 124 signatory do not include russia , china and the u . israel ha not signed either . but the icc ha ruled that it doe have legal authority to prosecute criminal act in the war because the palestinian are signatories.if the arrest warrant are issued , it would mean that mr netanyahu , israel ’ s longest-serving prime minister , would not be able to visit close western ally without risking arrest . uk prime minister rishi sunak said the icc ’ s action were `` not helpful to reaching a pause in the fighting , getting hostage out or humanitarian aid in `` . but if the warrant are issued , britain would have to make the arrest , unless it could argue successfully that mr netanyahu had diplomatic immunity . an all-important exception for mr netanyahu and mr gallant is the u . the white house belief the icc doe not have jurisdiction in the conflict , a position that might widen the split inside joe biden ’ s democratic party over the war . progressive have already welcomed the icc ’ s action . staunch ally of israel among the democrat might support republican move to pas a law to sanction icc official or ban them from the u . a rumour of impending indictment churned through europe , america and the middle east week ago , a group of republican senator issued the kind of threat to mr khan and his staff that they might have heard in a movie . `` target israel and we will target you . . . you have been warned . `` yoav gallant would also be unable to travel freely . the word he used when announcing that israel would besiege gaza ha been frequently quoted by critic of israel ’ s conduct . two day after the hamas attack on 7 october , mr gallant said : `` i have ordered a complete siege on the gaza strip . there will be no electricity , no food , no fuel , everything is closed … we are fighting human animal and we are acting accordingly `` . mr khan writes in his statement that `` israel ha intentionally and systematically deprived the civilian population in all part of gaza of object indispensable to human survival `` . famine , he say , is present in part of gaza and imminent in others . israel denies there is a famine , claiming that food shortage are caused not by their siege - but by hamas theft and un incompetence.if an arrest warrant is granted for ismail haniyeh , the head of the hamas political branch , he will have to think harder about his regular trip to meet senior arab leader . he is likely to spend much more time at his base in qatar , which like israel , did not sign the rome statute that set up the icc.the other two accused hamas leader , yahya sinwar and mohammed deif , are believed to be hiding somewhere inside gaza . an arrest warrant doe not add much to the pressure on them . israel ha been trying to kill them for the last seven months.the warrant would also put mr netanyahu in a category of accused leader that also includes russian president vladmir putin , and late colonel muammar gaddafi of libya . mr putin face an arrest warrant for the unlawful deportation and transfer of child from ukraine to russia . before he wa killed by his own people , col gaddafi ’ s arrest warrant wa for murder and persecution of unarmed civilian . it is not attractive company for benjamin netanyahu , the leader of a state that pride itself on it democracy .",israel gaza war : more rafah evacuation a israel step up operation

wear nappy – a practice one medic said amounted to “ torture ” . a whistle-blower detailed how procedure in one military hospital were “ routinely ” carried out without painkiller , causing “ an unacceptable amount of pain ” to detainees.another whistle-blower said painkiller were used “ selectively ” and “ in a very limited way ” during an invasive medical procedure on a gazan detainee in a public hospital.he also said critically ill patient being held in makeshift military facility were being denied proper treatment because of a reluctance by public hospital to transfer and treat them . one detainee , taken from gaza for questioning by the israeli army and later released , told the bbc his leg had to be amputated because he wa denied treatment for an infected wound.a senior doctor working inside the military hospital at the centre of the allegation denied that any amputation were the direct result of condition there , but described the shackle and other restraint used by guard a “ dehumanisation ” . the israeli army said detainee at the facility were treated “ appropriately and carefully ” . the two whistle-blower the bbc spoke to were both in position to assess the medical treatment of detainee . both asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue among their colleagues.their account are supported by a report , published in february by physician for human right in israel , which said that israel ’ s civilian and military prison had become “ an apparatus of retribution and revenge ” and that detainee ’ human right were being violated - in particular their right to health . concern over the treatment of sick and injured detainee have centred on a military field hospital , at the sde teiman military base in southern israel.the field hospital wa set up by israel ’ s health ministry after the hamas attack specifically to treat gazan detainee , after some public hospital and staff expressed a reluctance to treat fighter captured on the day of the hamas attacks.since then , israeli force have rounded up large number of people from gaza and taken them to base like sde teiman for interrogation . those suspected of fighting for hamas are sent to israeli detention centre ; many others are released back to gaza without charge.the army doe not publish detail of the detainee it is holding . patient at the sde teiman hospital are kept blindfolded and permanently shackled to their bed by all four limb , according to several medic responsible for treating patient there.they are also made to wear nappy , rather than use a toilet.israel ’ s army said in response that handcuffing of detainee in the sde teiman hospital wa “ examined individually and daily , and carried out in case where the security risk requires it ” . it said that nappy [ diaper ] were used “ only for detainee who have undergone medical procedure for which their movement is limited ” . but witness , including the facility ’ s senior anaesthiologist , yoel donchin , say both the use of nappy and handcuff are universal in the hospital ward . “ the army create the patient to be 100 % dependent , like a baby , ” he said . “ you are cuffed , you are with diaper , you need water , you need everything – it ’ s dehumanisation ” . dr donchin said there wa no individual assessment of the need for restraint , and that even those patient who were unable to walk – for example , those with leg amputation – were handcuffed to the bed . he described the practice a “ stupid ” . two witness at the facility in the early week of the gaza war told u that patient there were kept naked under the blankets.one doctor with knowledge of condition there said prolonged cuffing to bed would cause “ huge suffering , horrible suffering ” , describing it a “ torture ” and saying patient would start to feel pain after a few hours.others have spoken of the risk of long-term nerve-damage . footage of gazan detainee released after interrogation show injury and scarring around their wrist and legs.last month , israel ’ s daily haaretz newspaper published allegation made by a doctor at the sde teiman site that leg amputation had been carried out on two prisoner , because of cuffing injuries.the allegation were made , the paper said , in a private letter sent by the doctor to government minister and the attorney-general , in which such amputation were described a “ unfortunately a routine event ” . the bbc ha not been able to independently verify this allegation.dr donchin said that amputation were not the direct result of cuffing and had involved other factor – such a infection , diabetes or problem with blood vessel . israeli medical guideline stipulate that no patient should be restrained unless there is a specific security reason for doing so , and that the minimum level of restraint should be used.the head of the country ’ s medical ethic board , yossi walfisch , after a visit to the site , said all patient had a right to be treated without being handcuffed , but that the safety of staff prevailed over other ethical consideration . “ terrorist are given proper medical treatment , ” he said in a published letter , “ with the aim of keeping restraint to a minimum and while maintaining the safety of the treating staff . ” many gazans detained by israel ’ s army are released without charge after interrogation.dr donchin said complaint from medical staff at the sde teiman military hospital had led to change , including a shift to looser handcuff . he said he insisted on guard removing restraint before any surgical procedure . “ it ’ s not pleasant to work there , ” he said . “ i know it ’ s against the ethical code to treat someone cuffed in the bed . but what ’ s the alternative ? is it better to let them die ? i don ’ t think so . ” but report suggest the attitude of medical staff towards detainee vary widely , in both military and civilian hospital . a whistle-blower who worked at the sde teiman field hospital back in october , shortly after the hamas attack on israel , described case of patient being given inadequate amount of painkiller , including anaesthetic.he said a doctor once refused his request that an elderly patient be given painkiller while they were opening up a recent , infected amputation wound . “ [ the patient ] started trembling from pain , and so i stop and say ‘ we can ’ t go on , you need to give him analgesia ’ , ” he said.the doctor told him it wa too late to administer it.the witness said such procedure were “ routinely done without analgesia ” resulting in “ an unacceptable amount of pain ” . on another occasion , he wa asked by a suspected hamas fighter to intercede with the surgical team to increase the level of morphine and anaesthetic during repeated surgeries.the message wa passed on , but the suspect again regained consciousness during the next operation and wa in a lot of pain . the witness said both he and other colleague felt there wa a sense in which it had been a deliberate act of revenge.the army said in response to these allegation that violence against detainee wa “ absolutely prohibited ” , and that it regularly briefed it force on the conduct required of them . any concrete detail of violence or humiliation would be examined , it said . a second whistle-blower said the situation at sde teiman wa only part of the problem , which extended into public hospital . the bbc is calling him “ yoni ” to protect his identity.in the day that followed the 7 october attack , he said , hospital in southern israel were faced with the challenge of treating both wounded fighter and wounded victim , often in the same emergency departments.hamas gunman had just attacked israeli community along the border fence with gaza , killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping some 250 others . “ the atmosphere wa extremely emotional , ” yoni said . “ hospital were completely overwhelmed , both psychologically and in term of capacity . ” “ there were instance where i heard staff discus whether detainee from gaza should get painkiller . or way to perform certain procedure that can turn the treatment into punishment . ” conversation like this were not uncommon , he said , even if actual instance appeared very rare . “ i have knowledge of one case where painkiller were used selectively , in a very limited way , during a procedure , ” he told the bbc . “ the patient did not receive any explanation of what wa going on . so , if you put together [ that ] someone is undergoing an invasive procedure , which involves even incision , and doesn ’ t know about that , and is blindfolded , then the line between treatment and assault thins out . ” we asked the health ministry to respond to these allegation , but they directed u to the idf . yoni also said that the sde teiman field hospital wa not equipped to treat severely injured patient , but that some of those held there in the early month of the war had fresh gunshot wound to the chest and abdomen.he said at least one critically ill man wa kept there because of a reluctance by public hospital to accept his transfer for treatment , adding that doctor at the base were “ frustrated ” by the situation.sufian abu salah , a 43-year-old taxi driver from khan youis , wa one of dozen of men detained during raid by israel 's army and taken to a military base for questioning.he said soldier carried out severe beating during the journey and also on arrival at the base , where he wa denied treatment for a minor wound on his foot , which then became infected . “ my leg got infected and turned blue , and a soft a a sponge , ” he told the bbc.after a week , he said , the guard took him to hospital , beating him on his injured leg on the way . two operation to clean his wound did not work , he told the bbc . “ afterwards , they took me to a public hospital , where the doctor gave me two option : my leg or my life . ” he chose his life . after they amputated his leg , he wa sent back to the military base , and later released back to gaza . `` this period wa mental and physical torture , ” he said . “ i can ’ t describe it . i wa detained with two leg and now i have only one . every now and then , i cry . ” the idf did not respond to the specific allegation about sufian ’ s treatment , but said the claim of violence towards him during his arrest or detention “ were unknown and will be examined ” . in the day after the 7 october attack , israel ’ s health ministry issued a directive that all gazan detainee should be treated in military or prison hospital , with the sde teiman field hospital created specifically to fill this role.the decision won the backing of many in israel ’ s medical establishment , with yossi walfisch , praising it a the solution to “ an ethical dilemma ” , which would remove responsibility for treating “ hamas terrorist ” from the public health system.others have called for the closure of sde teiman , describing the situation there a “ an unprecedented low point for the medical profession , and medical ethic . ” “ my fear is that what we ’ re doing in sde teiman won ’ t allow a return to the way it wa before , ” one doctor told the bbc . “ because thing that looked unreasonable to u before , will look reasonable when this crisis is over . ” yoel donchin , the anaesthesiologist , said medical staff at the field hospital sometimes gathered together to cry over the situation there . “ the moment our hospital close , ” he said , “ we ’ ll celebrate . ” additional reporting by : naomi scherbel-ball , gidi

who do not include israel or it ally , the u - to decide whether or not to enforce them.the u said the move against israel ’ s leader wa “ outrageous ” , while the uk described it a “ deeply unhelpful ” . but france expressed support for the icc and it “ fight against impunity ” . mr khan ’ s case against the leader of hamas and israel stem from the event of 7 october , when hamas gunman attacked southern israel , killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 others back to gaza a hostages.israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign to eliminate hamas , during which at least 35,640 people have been killed in gaza , according to the territory 's hamas-run health ministry.mr khan accused the hamas leader of crime against humanity and war crime including extermination , murder , the taking of hostage , rape and torture.for the israeli leader , the accusation included deliberate attack on civilian , and the use of starvation a a weapon of war , a well a extermination and murder . `` international law and the law of armed conflict apply to all , `` mr khan said . `` no foot soldier , no commander , no civilian leader -

norway , spain and ireland - the focus is to revive discussion about a two-state solution , which for year ha been little more than a slogan to which politician pay lip service . they hope talk of a political `` day after `` will open a way towards a ceasefire and the release of hostage . `` the only pathway to peace is political , `` said ireland 's taoiseach simon harris . for british minister , the focus is how best to support the palestinian authority ( pa ) so it could potentially help govern post-war gaza . the foreign secretary , lord cameron , told the house of lord this week that he wa pushing israel to stop withholding money from the pa . not only is israel denying the pa tax revenue , far-right finance minister belazel smotrich is also threatening to cut palestinian bank off from their israeli counterpart . lord cameron said he had told the israeli government : `` you may not think the palestinian authority is ideal . you may think that it fails in many respect . but you need to find a partner that is not hamas that you can work with in gaza and the west bank , and that partner should be the new technocratic government run by the palestinian authority . `` uk treasury official are understood to be preparing new form of financial and technical support for the pa . but there are also some within government who are pushing for the uk to be more explicit about it own thought for how a palestinian state would be created . `` you ca n't support a two-state solution and not talk about recognition , `` one senior and well-placed source told me . `` what we lack is a timeline . we agree the starting point : stop the war . and we agree on the creation of a palestinian state . but there 's no definition of an irreversible path towards it . we have got to get into that space , otherwise we will be dealing with this for the next 70 year . `` then there are voice from within israel . defence minister yoav gallant ha issued a passionate denunciation of benjamin netanyahu 's refusal to set out a post-war plan . `` the ' day after hamas ' will only be achieved with palestinian entity taking control of gaza , accompanied by international actor , establishing a governing alternative to hamas rule , `` he said . fellow war cabinet member benny gantz ha gone a step further , threatening to resign from the government unless mr netanyahu agreed a six-point plan by 8 june . that included a demilitarised gaza and the establishment of a joint u , european , arab and palestinian administration . the focus of these two former general is more military than political . they fear - and wish to avoid - the israeli defense force ( idf ) running gaza in the long run , which mr gallant said would be a `` dangerous course `` for which israel would pay a heavy price in `` bloodshed and victim `` . the united state share this view . `` it is imperative not only that the conflict in gaza end a soon a possible , but that israel come forward with a clear plan for how gaza is going to be governed , secured , redeveloped , `` secretary of state antony blinken told a senate committee hearing this week . without that , he said , israel would face unacceptable option : long-term military occupation and insurgency , the return of hamas , or anarchy and lawlessness . `` we believe that palestinian must be governed by themselves , `` he said . the u is also putting pressure on arab state to agree an international force that could establish security in gaza in the short term . the u would not put it own troop on the ground but want country including egypt , jordan , morocco , bahrain and the uae to do so instead . but diplomat say these country have made clear they would take part only if the west recognised the state of palestine , there wa an agreed pathway to a two-state solution , and they came at the invitation of some kind of palestinian leadership . `` ' the day after ' can not be separated from the political process , it must be part of a comprehensive package , `` one arab diplomat told me . `` no-one will put one foot on the ground unless there is a political process . `` some arab state feel the u ha been too focused on trying to secure a deal to normalise diplomatic relation between israel and saudi arabia . they accept this may be key to getting israel 's agreement to a wider political settlement , but suspect it is seen too much a a `` silver bullet `` by some u official . they also think the u need to think harder about `` the day after `` for israel , engaging more closely with moderate voice who could win popular support for a palestinian-governed gaza . there is discussion , too , about what role turkey could play , using it leverage over hamas to agree some kind of post-war deal . ultimately the key obstacle to any agreement is benjamin netanyahu . he refuse to discus it apart from categorically opposing any role for the palestinian authority . he fear upsetting hard-right member of his government who favour long-term israeli occupation . but pressure is rising on the prime minister , and one day he may have to choose . `` the risk is that there is no ' day after ' , `` said one western diplomat . `` israel could do rafah , hamas would still be there , there could be another rafah . the military campaign could go on for month . ``",newspaper headline : pm 's ' university cut ' and pension ' tax battle '

2024-06-03T14:51:01.122Z,BBC,"for the leader of both hamas and israel , ending the war in gaza ha become a deadly game of survival.the term on which the war finally end could largely determine their political future and their grip on power . for hamas leader yahya sinwar , even his physical survival.it ’ s partly why previous negotiation have failed . it ’ s also why the question of how to permanently end the fighting ha been put off to the last stage of the plan outlined by u president joe biden on friday.that transition between talk on a limited hostage-for-prisoner deal to discussion about a permanent ceasefire would , mr biden acknowledged , be “ difficult ” . but it ’ s also where the success or failure of this latest deal is likely to hinge.the u say it ha submitted a draft resolution to the un security council supporting the ceasefire plan outlined by president biden . the three-phase plan involves an end to the conflict , the release of the hostage and reconstruction of the palestinian territory.israel ’ s prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , ha strong domestic reason for wanting to take this deal step by step.phase one , a outlined by mr biden , would see the release of dozen of hostage , both living and dead . that would be widely welcomed in a country where the failure to free all those held by hamas is , for many , a glaring moral stain on mr netanyahu 's management of the war.but hamas is unlikely to give up it most politically sensitive hostage – woman , wounded , elderly – without some kind of guarantee that israel won ’ t simply restart the war once they ’ re home.israel confirms death of four more hostage in gazaleaks , quoted by israeli medium on monday morning , suggested that benjamin netanyahu ha told parliamentary colleague that israel would be able to keep it option open.that option , to resume fighting – until hamas is “ eliminated ” – is , some believe , the least mr netanyahu ’ s far-right coalition partner will demand.without their support , he face the prospect of early election and the continuation of a corruption trial.mr netanyahu need to keep his long-term option open , to stand a chance of winning their support for any initial hostage deal . hamas leader , on the other hand , are likely to want permanent ceasefire guarantee upfront.previous deal have collapsed into this chasm . bridging it now will depend on how much room for manoeuvre mr netanyahu ha with his hard-right government ally to find alternative to the “ elimination ” of hamas – and how far hamas leader are prepared to consider them . mr netanyahu talked over the weekend about the destruction of hamas ’ s “ military and governing capability ” and ensuring that the group no longer posed a threat to israel.few dispute that hamas ha suffered major loss to it military infrastructure – and even , some say , to it public support within gaza and it control of the streets.but there ’ s no sign that israel ha killed or captured it top leader yahya sinwar and mohammed deif , and leaving them free in gaza to celebrate the withdrawal of israeli force would spell political disaster for israel ’ s embattled prime minister.on monday a u state department spokesman said that although hamas 's capability had `` steadily degraded `` in recent month , it remained a threat and the u did not believe the group could be eliminated militarily.meanwhile the white house said mr biden had `` confirmed israel ’ s readiness to move forward with the term that have now been offered to hamas `` and said the palestinian group wa now the only obstacle to a deal.separately , military spokesman rear admiral daniel hagari said the israeli military would be able to ensure israel 's security in the event of any truce agreed by the government.however yanir cozin , diplomatic correspondent with israel ’ s military radio station , glz , belief that mr netanyahu won ’ t end the war until he can frame it a a success . “ a deal that leaf hamas is a big failure , ” he said . “ eight month on , when you haven ’ t achieved any of the war goal – not finishing hamas , bringing all the hostage back , or securing the border – then he doesn ’ t want to end the war . but he also understands that he can not leave it until the next israeli election in 2026 . ” “ if he can say , ‘ we exiled yahya sinwar and mohammed deif , they ’ re not living in gaza ’ – and if the people living close to gaza and the northern border can go back – i think he can keep his government together . but it ’ s a lot of ‘ ifs ’ . ” hamas is very unlikely to agree to the exile or surrender of it top figure . but there are clear split emerging between hamas leader inside and outside gaza.former israeli prime minister ehud barak , who ha also served a defence minister , told israeli radio on monday that president biden had announced the deal “ after seeing that netanyahu only move ahead when he ’ s certain that sinwar will refuse ” . “ how do you think sinwar will react when he tends to agree and then he ’ s told : but be quick , because we still have to kill you after you return all the hostage , ” he said.in the meantime , ten of thousand of israeli displaced after the hamas attack on 7 october are watching their prime minister ’ s next move.among them is yarin sultan , a 31-year-old mother of three who ran from her home in sderot on gaza ’ s border the morning after the hamas attack . she say she won ’ t go home until yahya sinwar and mohammed deif are no longer free . “ this ceasefire will kill u , ” she told the bbc . “ we will free the hostage , but a few year from now you will be the next hostage , you will be the next people who get murdered , the woman that are raped – all this will happen again . ” additional reporting by

2024-06-05T05:41:13.978Z,BBC,"after israeli force pulled out of gaza city ’ s vast al-shifa hospital complex on 1 april , following their second raid there , stunned palestinian who pored over the burnt-out ruin said it reeked of death.during the past eight month of war , hospital have come under repeated attack , with israel claiming they are used a base by hamas ; something the group denies . but event at al-shifa – once the biggest and best equipped medical facility in the gaza strip – have arguably been the most dramatic.the two-week surprise raid , launched after israel said hamas had regrouped at the site , wa described by the israeli government a `` precise and surgical `` . it spokesman , avi hyman , asserted that it had set `` the gold standard of urban warfare `` . he said : “ we took out over 200 terrorist . we apprehended over 900 terrorist with not a single civilian casualty . ” with decaying body sticking out of the sand piled up by combat bulldozer in the courtyard of al-shifa , the claim that there had been no civilian casualty wa immediately questioned.in recent week , four mass graf have been uncovered at the site , with palestinian search team saying that several hundred body have been found . we have worked with a journalist in gaza to follow development . “ we ’ ve extracted martyr , many of whom are decomposed and completely unidentifiable , ” a palestinian civil defence worker , ramus dababesh told u grimly on 8 may a he stood by a line of white plastic body bag at al-shifa , wearing a face mask and full protective gear . “ we ’ ve found corps of woman , child and individual without head a well a torn body part , ” he added.the civil defence lack forensic equipment and expertise , but it team have been using photo and video to document the remains . a director , dr mohamed mughir , told u there were suspicious find ; describing how “ sign of field execution , binding mark , gunshot wound to the head and torture mark on the limb were observed on the body of some martyr `` . the un security council ha expressed “ deep concern ” at the discovery of mass graf at both al-shifa and nasser hospital in southern gaza . along with the u and the european union , it ha called for an independent investigation into possible war crimes.the israel defense force ( idf ) say that during it raid of the gaza hospital , it soldier exhumed body that palestinian had buried earlier a part of it search for the remains of some 250 hostage captured during the deadly hamas attack on israel on 7 october . it maintains body were examined respectfully and those not belonging to israeli captive were returned to their place . however , at least some of the corps found recently at al-shifa were those of patient who died during israel ’ s latest military action . a paramedic involved in the search said some had iv catheter still attached.on 15 april , the bbc met two men whose dead mother were last seen being treated at the hospital . their body had just been recovered from a mass grave . “ i came running here when they told me of the grave , ” said mohammed al-khatib , who had spent day searching for his mother , khawla . “ by the grace of almighty god her body wa found . ” walid fteima said his elderly mother , lina abu leila , wa being treated for malnutrition and severe dehydration when she died . her body wa decomposed , and he could only identify her from injury she had from an israeli bombing last year . “ [ she ] had a toe amputated on each foot , ” he explained.after it began it operation at the hospital early on 18 march , the idf ordered thousand of civilian sheltering there and living in the vicinity to leave and head south . however , it said the hospital could continue to function . by the end of two week , only some 140 patient and medic reportedly remained . the local who representative , dr rik peeperkorn , say this group endured “ horrific condition ” . after being repeatedly moved around the complex , he say , they “ actually ended up in the human resource building which wa completely unfit for treatment `` . ultimately , he say , 20 patient died.several surviving patient – all wounded in previous israeli strike – told u they were given only tiny quantity of food such a canned tuna . they said there were severe shortage of drinking water and medication . “ the bombing surrounded u 24/7 , ” said mohamed al-nadeem who is half paralysed . “ i am sick and unable to move . i wa sleeping on the floor without blanket . ” “ there were no dressing or painkiller , ” said rafif doghmush , 15 , whose foot ha been amputated.the idf ha told journalist that no staff or patient died a a “ direct result ” of it action , but that some may have died of “ natural cause `` . during it raid , it said it helped patient by moving them out of harm ’ s way and that medical supply and device a well a food , water , and a generator were brought to the hospital.grainy drone footage shared by the idf after it launched it raid on 18 march showed palestinian gunman apparently shooting at soldier from inside al-shifa hospital . later , the gunman were said to have barricaded themselves in ward and corridor , opening fire and throwing explosives.three israeli soldier were confirmed to have been killed during the two-week long operation.the idf briefed journalist that it action at the hospital wa taken based on “ concrete intelligence ” that hamas and palestinian islamic jihad had taken over part of the site , suggesting their operative had been using it to access basic supply a well a power and the internet . while hamas denied using al-shifa a a base , it official did not deny the presence of some member inside the complex , indicating that they may have been among displaced people sheltering there.israel ha said that “ over 200 terrorist ” were killed in and around al-shifa , a well a the hundred detained , but ha only given some names.these include faiq al-mabhouh , described a head of operation in hamas ’ internal security service . the hamas-run government ’ s medium office said he wa a police commander who had been co-ordinating aid delivery to northern gaza.others killed were identified a a senior hamas commander , raed thabet , said to have been head of recruitment and supply acquisition , and mahmoud zakzouk , said to have been deputy commander of the hamas rocket unit in gaza city . two other hamas operative were named a fadi dweik and zakaria najib , said to have been involved in organising attack in the occupied west bank.in april , the idf also released footage which it said wa from the interrogation of tarek abu shaluf , spokesman for the political wing of islamic jihad . it said he had been captured at al-shifa.hamas and islamic jihad do not routinely confirm the name of low-level fighter killed by israeli military action , making it very difficult to estimate how many were killed at the hospital and in the vicinity . it is likely that a number were among the dead found in mass graf . despite the israeli claim that there wa “ not a single civilian casualty ” from it raid , we have been given strong testimony that there were palestinian civilian killed by heavy israeli bombardment and intense shooting in the surrounding neighbourhood.the palestinian civil defence told u that hundred of palestinian were still reported to be missing following the raid in march.there have repeatedly been conflicting narrative about what ha happened in and around al-shifa.during it first controversial raid there , the israeli military raised expectation that israeli hostage might be found at the site . it also released a graphic depicting a vast underground tunnel network that it suggested wa underneath the hospital , serving a a major hamas command and control centre.while the idf said it retrieved the body of two israeli hostage near to the hospital , it did not announce that it had found any within the complex . security camera footage that wa recovered did show that at least two foreign captive were taken there on 7 october.the idf showed what it said wa a fortified 55-metre tunnel on the hospital ground . this fell short of it initial claim about the extent of hidden tunnel , although later reporting suggested the passage – which wa blown up – had actually been longer and wa most likely connected to a wider network under gaza city.when it returned to the site in march , the idf suggested it key discovery were of a different nature , releasing picture of cash , weapon , and ammunition it said it had found there along with hamas document . al-shifa ha been at the heart of a debate about whether hamas us medical site a a cover . israel ha consistently claimed that the group hide it fighter and infrastructure behind the sick and wounded , which it suggests ha rendered hospital legitimate military targets.hamas denies misusing civilian site and accuses israel of violating international humanitarian law by targeting hospitals.in april , when the un called for “ a clear , transparent and credible investigation ” of mass graf in gaza , it spokesman stephane dujarric told reporter that more journalist needed to be able to work safely in the territory to report on the fact . during the war , israel and egypt have denied free access to foreign media.mr dujarric also said : “ it ’ s important that all forensic evidence be well preserved . ” so far , that is proving to be a challenge.international forensic specialist have been unable to reach gaza to investigate what happened at al-shifa . that ha left much of the focus locally on registering and identifying the dead where possible , and giving them proper burials.the disturbance of the mass grave site , expert say , will ultimately make it much harder to uncover the truth about them.meanwhile , although al-shifa ha been largely destroyed , there have been recent effort to restart very limited medical service on site . these gained momentum a israel targeted other health facility which it said were being used by hamas , particularly kamal adwan hospital in northern gaza.in late may , in a hastily repaired room of the kidney dialysis unit at al-shifa , the journalist working with u met four patient a they sat connected to steadily beeping machine . after so many death at the hospital , it is once again providing some life-saving treatment .",gaza : israel revers shut down of associated press live feed

palestinian flee to rafah to escape fighting and bombardment elsewhere.israel say taking control of rafah and eliminating the hamas battalion there is crucial to achieving it war aim . it told palestinian in rafah to move to sandy coastal area or the city of khan younis , which is largely in ruins.now the un is warning that the movement of such a large number of people in such a short timeframe alongside a sharp fall in aid delivery is having deadly consequence . `` people are dying every single day . . . the vast majority according to report are woman and child . many of them are dying unnecessarily due to lack of medical care . child are dying due to malnutrition and dehydration , `` juliette touma , spokeswoman for the un agency for palestinian refugee unrwa , told bbc arabic . on 6 may israeli military spokesman avichay adraee instructed palestinian in eastern rafah to evacuate to an “ expanded humanitarian zone ” that stretch from the nearby al-mawasi area to the central town of deir al-balah and said they would find field hospital , tent , food and other supplies.the israel defense force ( idf ) then took control of the rafah border crossing with egypt , which lie to the south-east of rafah city , a it began what it described a a “ precise counterterrorism operation ” against hamas operative and infrastructure in eastern rafah . the u had said it

i don ’ t know , ” mr baskin said . “ my perception is that the longer israel continues this war , the easier for [ hamas ] to recruit new recruit from bereaved family and people who ’ ve lost their home , and an armed insurgency against the israeli will continue a long a israel is in gaza . ” the israeli rescue in gaza , which resulted in the death of one israeli special force officer , wa considered a successful operation by israel ’ s top authority , despite the carnage in nuseirat that ha been largely ignored in israel . “ if anyone belief that [ saturday ’ s ] operation absolves the government to strike a deal , they are living a fantasy , ” nahum barnea , an israeli political commentator , wrote in the yedioth ahronoth newspaper . “ the opposite is true . the joy over the successful rescue of the four only evinced the need for a deal . ” hour after the four freed hostage arrived in a hospital near tel aviv , mr netanyahu visited them and their family . it did not go unnoticed that this happened before the end of the jewish sabbath , when official activity are often muted , and wa accompanied by a torrent of video and photo released by his team . “ when the ending is bad , the prime minister doesn ’ t show up . he doesn ’ t call , either , ” avi marciano , whose daughter noa wa killed in captivity , wrote on facebook.us secretary of state antony blinken is back in the middle east , his eighth trip to the region since the hamas attack , in another effort to push for a deal . there are also growing concern that , without a ceasefire in gaza , violence might escalate along israel ’ s border with lebanon , where the iranian-backed hezbollah movement ha carried out near-daily attacks.with a wide gap remaining between israel and hamas , u pressure is not a guarantee of progress . “ there ’ s no quick end to this war … this could theoretically go on for year , ” mr baskin said . “ i really want to be optimistic , but it ’ s very difficult to be . ”",thousand march through london for return of hamas hostage
