2024-04-03 05:32:31.543,jpost,"Once in a while , new startling and exciting discoveries filter through even in this data-drenched Internet-accelerated world . The classical music community was surprised and thrilled around a year and a half or so ago when a long-lost score by Felix Mendelssohn and Ignaz Moscheles , which came to light in 2009 after a hiatus of close to 200 years , was restored to its former glory and unveiled to the public.Internationally renowned pianist Tomer Lev and his MultiPiano Ensemble are now proffering the work to local audiences , with the Israeli Philharmonic Orchestra ( IPO ) in tow.The four-date series kicks off at the Charles Bronfman Auditorium in Tel Aviv tonight , April 3 ( 7 p.m . ) , followed by two further concerts there on April 4 and 6 ( 8 p.m . and 9 p.m . respectively ) , closing at the Jerusalem Theatre on April 7 ( 8 p.m . ) . The Fantasy and Variations on a Theme by Weber ( aka Fantasia and Variations ) has a fascinating subtext and will be featured in forthcoming concerts . The program also includes an intriguing and now highly poignant work from 2012 by Israeli composer Arie Levanon , who died on October 31 at 91 , called Land of Four Languages.The full lineup includes Orawa by Polish composer Wojciech Kilar , who died in 2013 , Dvorak&rsquo;s Carnival Overture , and Beethoven&rsquo;s Violin Concerto in D major , with Vadim Gluzman as soloist.Fantasia and Variations had the perfect marketing springboard regarding the performing artists , debut set , and the hit parade of the time . The original ivory ticklers were its composers Mendelssohn and Moscheles , with whom Mendelssohn studied for a while.Lev says the venture was destined to get the ticket offices rolling from the off . & ldquo;The work is based on a theme by Weber , & rdquo ; Lev explains . The score in question was riding high in the popularity stakes of the day . & ldquo;It is quite a story . In 1833 , Mendelssohn was enjoying the best stage of his career . He was a superstar in England . That was the country where he was most admired . & rdquo;THAT PUBLIC profile led to an offer that was too good to refuse . & ldquo;His teacher , Ignaz Moscheles , lived in London . Both were of German Jewish origin and the most idolized piano virtuosi in England and Europe . They were the two great Jewish virtuosos . & rdquo;That was also recognized in lofty societal circles . & ldquo;They were invited to be the key performers in a charity event under the aegis of the royal palace in London . It was a high-brow charity event , & rdquo ; Lev notes.The organizers sought something that would do justice to the occasion and wow the audience . They chose a proven product and asked the artists to run with it . & nbsp ; & ldquo;They went for the two biggest musical celebrities . Each performed parts of a recital , but the event's highlight was when they were asked to jointly prepare something based on one of the hit numbers at that time : Gypsy March , written by Weber for a musical theater production called Preciosa . Everyone was mad about Gypsy March . & rdquo;Back in the early 19th century , classical composers and musicians frequently allowed themselves to stray from the compositional straight and narrow . That suited Mendelssohn and Moscheles down to the ground . & ldquo;They were asked to improvise variations on this theme , the Gypsy March , & rdquo ; says Lev . & ldquo;They were both excellent improvisers and played like in a jam session ; you take a tune with a chords chart and improvise . & rdquo;That comes across in Fantasia and Variations . & ldquo;You have one piano playing something elaborate while the other plays more in line with the charts , and then they switch . It was an open approach . & rdquo;It worked well . & ldquo;The event was an amazing success , and they asked them to do it again , & rdquo ; Lev remarks , noting that it was not just a matter of reprising the crowd-pleaser . "" They had more time to plan it for the second event . They were both so busy . They decided to turn the improvisations into a written composition . They also added an orchestra . & rdquo ; Hence , the format for this week&rsquo;s Tel Aviv and Jerusalem concerts.NOT THAT Mendelssohn and Moscheles were exactly scratching around for work at the time , but , presumably , the response to their efforts must have had them rubbing their hands with anticipation of thrilling audiences elsewhere . However , as with all good yarns , there was a dramatic twist . & lsquo;Shortly after the second concert , the sheet music disappeared , and it was forgotten . & rdquo;There was more drama when Mendelssohn died 14 years after the charity event doubleheader , at only 38 . Undeterred , his partner in box office success decided to make some hay while the sun still filtered through before the memory of the triumph lingered . & ldquo;Moscheles tried to restore the sheet music , & rdquo ; says Lev . That , it transpired , was easier said than done . & ldquo;In fact , he came up with a different composition . He didn&rsquo;t really manage to restore the original work . & rdquo;Nevertheless , as they say in certain commercial quarters , you can regain your public profile if you hang around long enough . & ldquo;Suddenly , they discovered the original manuscript in archives in Saint Petersburg , of all places , & rdquo ; Lev chuckles . That proved to be a game changer.Plenty of elbow grease had to be invested before the work could become a practical proposition for public performance . & nbsp;That is precisely what Lev and his MultiPiano counterparts & ndash ; Berenika Glixman , Nimrod Meity-Haftel , and Lior Lifshitz & ndash ; have done in the past year or so , in London and Berlin and , a couple of weeks ago , at Carnegie Hall in New York.Sheet music was languishing in the archives , and it was deplorable , just as the international classical community began gearing up for the bicentennial of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s birth in 2009 . It was a mess . & ldquo;There were many things scribbled on the pages and many things added , and the paper was in a bad state , & rdquo ; Lev advises . & nbsp ; & ldquo;They took experts from the state conservatory in Moscow , with experts in ink and paper . Eventually , they had a good copy of the original work 1833 . & rdquo ; All&rsquo;s well , and that ends well . When Lev got wind of the developments , he invited the chief restorer of the sheet music to come to Israel to give a talk about the whole process . Much to the quartet leader&rsquo;s surprise and pleasure , the lecturer gave him the score after the lecture.Lev was determined to grace the work with commensurate respect and revive public interest . That led to the aforementioned concerts worldwide , with the Berlin date filmed and recorded , the recording due out soon on the Hyperion label , and a rendition of an intriguing composition by Moscheles . & ldquo;We are one of the only ensembles in the world to have a copy of the sheet music and to perform it , & rdquo ; Lev notes proudly.Lev : thrilled to play the original work in IsraelLev says he is thrilled to be able to play the original work here . & ldquo;The concerts with the IPO close a lovely circle , after concerts in London , Berlin , Carnegie Hall in New York , Tel Aviv and Jerusalem . You could see this is a sort of resurrection of the work , bringing it back to the surface . The audiences have responded amazingly so far . We have had standing ovations everywhere . & rdquo;There is , surely , more rapturous applause due for the ensemble and IPO when they present Fantasia and Variations here . And Levanon should rightly be well received , too . His composition feeds off the sounds , rhythms , and sensibilities of four cultures that the Romanian-born composer considered to be core to the State of Israel&mdash;Hebrew , Yiddish , Arabic , and Ladino.Levanon wrote the piece for MultiPiano , which performs works on two pianos for four , six , or eight hands , with or without an orchestra.Lev believes the time is particularly ripe for the work to resound from the concert halls and , hopefully , change mindsets & ndash ; and possibly make some difference to the dismal state of regional affairs . & ldquo;When we started touring internationally with MultiPiano , we saw that people don&rsquo;t know about Israel&rsquo;s multiculturalism . So we decided we wanted to perform something that would reflect the pluralist face of this country . & rdquo;Levanon was up for that . & ldquo;He composed Land of Four Languages . He chose four traditional tunes in different languages . His message was that if the four can live together harmoniously , in the score , maybe they will learn to live together in the real world . & rdquo;The composition has been well received thus far , but in the wake of October 7 , Lev feels the cross-cultural creation has taken on added significance . & ldquo;After Levanon&rsquo;s passing , and after everything Israel has been through in the past few months , the value and message of this work are more relevant than ever . & rdquo;For tickets and more information : https : / / www.ipo.co.il/en /",' loved but not lost ' : piano ensemble presents new classical music restored
2021-07-14 22:06:13.437,jpost,"This week , a number of voices , many of them linked to Israel&rsquo;s former ruling Likud Party , claimed that the Mughrabi bridge , which links the Temple Mount to an area near the Western Wall and is used by non-Muslims to visit the Temple Mount , is in danger of collapse . Former transportation minister MK Miri Regev said & ldquo;it is forbidden to wait another moment with the demolition of the bridge and the construction of an appropriate replacement . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The concerns about the bridge ostensibly date from a month ago when an engineer&rsquo;s report said that the wood the bridge was constructed with does not enable safe use of the bridge . This raises questions about why the previous government of Benjamin Netanyahu didn&rsquo;t replace or reinforce the bridge recently , despite being in office for a decade . How did a bridge suddenly become unsafe around the same time Israel got a new government ? Why is there now a new potential crisis at the sensitive holy site ? Did the crisis emerge precisely when the Kingdom of Jordan and Israel are working to repair ties ? Jordan is sensitive to any changes to the status quo and previous attempts to alter the bridge have met with protests and also conspiracies spreading about al-Aqsa being in danger . These kinds of conspiracies have led to conflict in the past , including the recent Gaza war . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; So how did we get here ? In 2011 , a temporary structure , often called the Mughrabi bridge after an early ramp and neighborhood that once existed underneath the temporary bridge , was closed due to safety concerns . At the time , reports said that & ldquo;officials closed the Mugrabi Bridge on Sunday , three days before the municipality deadline to close the ramp leading from the Western Wall plaza to the Temple Mount . The Jerusalem city engineer , Shlomo Eshkol , has warned over the past year in a series of letters to the prime minister and the Western Wall Heritage Foundation & ndash ; which oversees the area & ndash ; that the temporary bridge is unsafe . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Let&rsquo;s recall what happened at the time , 10 years ago . & ldquo;The municipality originally set November 28 , 2011 as the deadline to destroy the bridge , but . . . Netanyahu intervened to stop the demolition , worried about triggering riots across the Arab world . In the most recent letter , sent last week , the municipality insisted the entrance must be closed to the public until a new bridge is built . & rdquo ; Netanyahu chose to cancel the demolition of the bridge because of concerns in Egypt and Jordan . The Jerusalem Municipality tried to close the structure on December 12 . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Oddly the issue then disappeared from the headlines . Somehow , the unsafe bridge continued to exist with some modifications . In 2014 , a new report emerged . A new part of the bridge had been added . & ldquo;Erected less than two weeks ago , the bridge had not officially been opened when . . . Netanyahu ordered it be dismantled after it became clear that the project was not approved by the relevant authorities , and amid mounting Jordanian protests . & rdquo ; Once again , the temporary bridge , erected after the ramp collapsed partially in 2004 , had become permanent and any changes were seen as a & ldquo;status quo&rdquo ; issue threatening peace in the region . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; It appears that in 2011 and 2014 the Netanyahu government chose to forego changes in order to maintain calm . Now , suddenly , there are calls to remove the bridge by members of the same party that didn&rsquo;t remove it for a decade . This , despite the fact that it is well known that previous changes have always resulted in a crisis . Is this controversy about the bridge or creating stumbling block for the new government in ties with Jordan ? Jordan&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi has met his Israeli counterpart in what the Jordan Times calls a & ldquo;semblance of normality . & rdquo ; There is a new deal to supply Jordan with water . Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has been outspoken on the importance of ties with Jordan . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; For Netanyahu , the Kingdom of Jordan was always a sour point . He ran into many controversies with the kingdom dating back to his time in office in the 1990s . Netanyahu didn&rsquo;t make progress on the plans to develop the Arava peace valley with Jordan , and Jordan harshly slammed Israel during the 25-year anniversary of the peace agreement between the countries , demanding Israel return lands that were part of the agreement . In 2017 , an incident with an Israeli security guard in Jordan , in which two Jordanians were killed , led to another crisis . Most recently , Netanyahu canceled a short trip to the UAE on the eve of elections after a stop in Jordan apparently was nixed . In addition Jordan&rsquo;s crown prince canceled a trip to Jerusalem in March . Relations were at their lowest point in memory . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Netanyahu has slammed Jordan in recent days , critiquing the water deal and accusing Jordan of having ties to Iran . The insinuation was that Jordan had transported oil from Iraq to Egypt and that somehow , this helps Iran . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; It is in this context that there are rising calls for the government to make changes to the Mughrabi bridge . Any chances are likely to cause a crisis . Closing the bridge would anger some of the Jews who visit the Temple Mount weekly . It would also mean non-Muslims could not visit the historic area near the mosque and Dome of the Rock . Any changes to the bridge would lead to complaints from Jordan unless there was coordination . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; There is no doubt the bridge needs to be safe , both for those who use it and because it stretches over a part of the women&rsquo;s section of the Western Wall . There are many questions to be asked why this bridge issue was never responsibly addressed for more than a decade . It appears convenient that suddenly those who were in office for many years and made no changes now want it closed , demolished , changed or removed . Like many things that took place over the last decade in Israel where problems were managed , or what some call & ldquo;mowing the grass , & rdquo ; was done to postpone addressing major issues . The bridge is a symbol of how Jerusalem and Israel were managed . This crisis management meant postponing many major problems , such as dealing with Gaza&rsquo;s constant crises , to the issues facing Bedouin in the Negev , to ignoring the crowding at Meron that led to a disaster , and then not investigating it . The current government wants to address the issues , but stoking up issues like the Mughrabi bridge appears to be a way to create a crisis with Jordan precisely when Jordan and Israel are keen on working together again . Whether the kingdom might be interested in being flexible regarding the bridge might be address , but such status quo issues usually take time and are sensitive because of the position of the Palestinians and the Wakf and other authorities and stakeholders . The King of Jordan is meeting the US president on July 19 . Perhaps responsible policies regarding the bridge will prevail . & nbsp ; & nbsp ;",is jerusalem’s mughrabi bridge in news to spark jordan crisis ? - analysis
2021-09-30 22:24:47.960,jpost,"The Palestinian Authority accused Israel of carrying out & ldquo;extra-judicial executions , & rdquo ; and called on the United Nations to provide protection for the Palestinians . Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) , meanwhile , called on Palestinians to step up the & ldquo;resistance&rdquo ; against Israel , in response to the killing of a gunman near Jenin and a woman who tried to stab police officers in the Old City of Jerusalem early Thursday . In the village of Burkin , near Jenin , soldiers shot and killed 22-year-old Alaa Zyoud , a member of PIJ&rsquo;s al-Quds Brigades . Hours later , police officers shot and killed Israa Khuzaimia , a mother of three from Kabatiya , also near Jenin . The woman was shot while she tried to carry out a stabbing attack near the Temple Mount in Jerusalem . The PLO accused Israel of killing the two & ldquo;in cold blood , & rdquo ; and called on the international community to assume its responsibilities toward & ldquo;the enforcement of international and humanitarian laws in the occupied territories . & rdquo ; The Palestinian Foreign Ministry condemned & ldquo;in the strongest terms the two heinous field executions committed by the occupation forces and its police in both Jerusalem and Burkin . & rdquo ; According to the ministry , the killings are the direct result of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett&rsquo;s evasion of the Palestinian issue during his speech at the UN General Assembly earlier this week . The killings are also & ldquo;an extension of a long series of criminal field execution orders issued by the political and military echelon in the occupying state to its soldiers to facilitate the process of shooting at the Palestinians , & rdquo ; the ministry said in a statement . The ministry also condemned settler assaults on Palestinians in the Masafar Yatta area near Hebron , claiming they were carried out & ldquo;under the supervision and protection&rdquo ; of the IDF . & ldquo;The ministry holds the Israeli government headed by Naftali Bennett fully and directly responsible for these crimes and their serious repercussions on the situation in the entire region , & rdquo ; the statement read , urging the UN to provide international protection for the Palestinians . It also called on the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to establish an investigation committee & ldquo;for Israeli crimes and violations . & rdquo ; The Palestinian Prisoners Club revealed that the IDF arrested 54 Palestinians in the Jenin area since the beginning of September , most of them after the escape of the six security prisoners from Gilboa Prison earlier in the month . The Prisoners Club accused Israel of imposing a policy of & ldquo;collective punishment&rdquo ; against Palestinians in the Jenin area , including the families of the six escaped inmates . The six were recaptured by Israel Police . PIJ mourned the death of its member , Alaa Zyoud , and pledged to pursue the fight against Israel . It said the increased violence in the West Bank was & ldquo;an authentic expression of the will of the Palestinian people who do not accept surrender , and whose resolve is not frustrated by conspiracies . & rdquo ; Responding to Thursday&rsquo;s killings , Hamas said that & ldquo;the armed resistance and the comprehensive confrontation with the occupation is capable of stopping its aggression and expelling its settlers from our occupied land . & rdquo ;","israeli ‘ extra-judicial executions ' slammed by pa , demanding international protection"

2021-10-08 16:06:29.253,jpost,"All the windows in the Hamamdeh family&rsquo;s small stone home are broken . The shattered jagged glass is one of the many visible scars of the violent events that took place in Khirbet al-Mufaqarah on September 28 , when the small , dusty South Hebron Hills Palestinian herding village of some 122 people was transformed into a battleground that left 12 Palestinians and five settlers injured . & ldquo;All the homes are like this , & rdquo ; said Mahmoud Hamamdeh , adding that & ldquo;this was a battle for our homes . . . . We were attacked with stones and sticks . & rdquo ; His three-year-old grandson Muhammad Baker Mahmoud Hamamdeh suffered a head wound in the attack serious enough to require a three-day hospital stay at Soroka-University Medical Center in Beersheba . A week later , dressed in gray pajamas and sandals , the brown-haired boy sat on the concrete floor in his home playing with large , multicolored Lego that two Israeli visitors had brought him . The room was mostly bare . A number of small , thin , colored foam mattresses were laid on the floor for seating . Muhammad had fitted the red , green , yellow and blue pieces together , as his mother , Bara&rsquo;a , and his grandfather Mahmoud described how their home was pelted by stones thrown by Jewish extremists who they presumed were settlers . & ldquo;This is the room where the children hid , & rdquo ; Mahmoud explained , because its steel shutter could provide safety . His grandson Muhammad , however , never made it into the safe room , because he had already been hit by rocks that went through two different windows of the bedroom he had been napping in . The room was filled with glass and blood , recalled Mahmoud , explaining that they thought he had died . Mahmoud walked over to the bedroom , where he held up the bloodstained sweatshirt Muhammad had slept in , to underscore how frightening the moment had been . The attack , which occurred about 2 p.m . on the Simhat Torah holiday , is the worst such incident of violence in that West Bank village that anyone can remember . The community is not linked up to an electricity or water grid and is located off a dirt road between the two settler outposts of Avigail and Maon Farm . The three communities are all unauthorized , and as a result the status of all three communities is tenuous . Both Palestinians and Israelis hold that their rights to the land supersede the IDF regulations that govern Area C of the West Bank where they are situated . Area C is under IDF military and civilian rule . Palestinians hold that this land should be part of the permanent borders of a Palestinian state , while the Israeli Right believes that this land , which is part of the biblical heartland , should be included within Israel&rsquo;s sovereign borders . PALESTINIAN FLAGS flutter in al-Mufaqarah , and Israeli flags can be seen in Avigail and Maon Farm . The historical narratives of these communities differ , as do their languages . Similarly , there is a wide gap between their narratives of how and why the attack on the village unfolded . A South Hebron Hills Regional Council spokesman claimed a group of some 20 settlers had walked in the morning from Avigail to Maon Farm and were on their way back when they were attacked by Palestinians . There was only a small army presence in the area , and they took action to defend themselves , he said . The security officer from Maon Farm came to their assistance , and he was attacked , with rocks thrown at his vehicle , the spokesman said . He provided The Jerusalem Post with photos that depict Palestinians holding rocks , including one that showed a masked Palestinian with a slingshot . Another photo showed Palestinians beside a building with stones and a stick . Channel 12 posted a video from the event , which showed army soldiers during the event accusing a Palestinian & ndash ; Basel Adra , from the area , who volunteers with the left-wing group B&rsquo;Tselem & ndash ; of setting brush aflame . Channel 12 then added that this was done so that Palestinians could accuse Jews of setting their village on fire . Adra took to Twitter to debunk the Channel 12 charge , posting a video that showed that the fire in question was started by a tear-gas canister . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie . The fire was caused by an army gas bomb . I literally filmed it , so I have proof . Also , there aren&rsquo;t any homes there & ndash ; just a pile of wood , & rdquo ; Adra tweeted . He added that & ldquo;I saw the fire , filmed it , and called residents to fetch water . & rdquo ; Initially , he wrote that two soldiers helped him , but then another soldier filmed him & ldquo;to fabricate a false accusation against me . & rdquo ; According to B&rsquo;Tselem the incident started around 2 p.m . when settlers attacked a shepherd in nearby Khirbet a-Rakeez while he was grazing his flock . B&rsquo;Tselem alleged that the settlers killed four of the shepherd&rsquo;s goats . Adra said the shepherd called for help , and then a stoning incident broke out between the settlers and the Palestinians , with the army arriving shorty after and shooting tear gas and stun grenades at the Palestinians . He charged that , at its height , the event included as many as 80 settlers , and that the violence spread beyond al-Mufaqarah and also included attacks on some homes in his village of al-Tuwani . Violence at this level , he speculated , could occur only if it had been preplanned in an attempt to scare Palestinians into leaving the area . & ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want us to live here , & rdquo ; he added . The attackers , he said , vandalized homes , vehicles and cut water lines . B&rsquo;Tselem published a video that showed a stoning attack by Jewish extremists against a home in al-Mufaqarah . In the video one can hear the sound of breaking glass and the explosion of stun grenades and tear gas . One settler source blamed the attack on outside Jewish extremists , primarily teens , adding that it was clear the violence there was unacceptable and went above and beyond any claim with respect to self-defense . He said that the army and the police have to be the ones who take steps to prevent the violence . The army declined to be interviewed for the article and the police did not respond as of press time to a request for details about their investigation into the incident . Police initially arrested six Israelis and one Palestinian in connection with the September 28 event . In an unusual move OC Central Command Maj . - Gen . Yehuda Fox visited al-Mufaqarah last week and spoke with Mahmoud Hamamdeh to learn firsthand about the incident . Palestinians , including Mahmoud , said that from their perspective the incident could not have occurred without the army , which they said was on the scene almost from the start . The village of al-Mufaqarah is close to the scene of a September 17 incident in which an IDF major and his unit prevented a group of left-wing activists from reaching a small Palestinian hamlet near the Avigail outpost so as to deliver a truckload of water . The soldiers were captured on film using what appeared to be undue force to dispel the activists , who had been marching on both sides of a narrow paved road that leads to the outpost and that also passes by Khirbet al-Mufaqarah . Less than two weeks later , it was this same IDF unit that was unable to prevent a group of extreme right-wing teenagers from reaching al-Mufaqarah and pelting its homes and residents with stones . THE AL-MUFAQARAH incident comes amid a heightened focus on violence by Jewish extremists and settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank , in a period when tensions have increased overall in that region , including in the South Hebron Hills . According to the UN , as of October 4 , there have been 264 attacks this year by settlers and Jewish extremists against Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem that resulted in property damage and 101 in which there were injuries . This is compared to data from all of 2020 in which there were 270 settler and Jewish extremist attacks that resulted in property damage and 82 in which there were injuries . Separately , UN data showed , 69 Israeli civilians have been injured by Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem , compared with 16 last year . According to South Hebron Hills Regional Council head Yochai Damri , & ldquo;There are 1,500 incidents of rock-throwing on Jews on the roads in the Judea-Samaria area every year . & rdquo ; STILL , A wide-ranging group attack such as the one that occurred last week is rare . Mahmoud Hamamdeh said it is impossible to describe the chaos of the attack ; the violence was overwhelming , and on all sides one didn&rsquo;t know what to do and where to be , he said . Rubber bullets , stun grenade and tear-gas casings are littered in the village . He rolled up his sleeve to show how he had two wounds on his arm , which he said were from the stun grenades and tear gas canisters that were thrown . When the attack began , he and his siblings had gathered for a family lunch , when they heard shouting about approaching settlers . & ldquo;I had 22 grandchildren who were present , & rdquo ; he said , and the whole time the attack lasted , their safety was uppermost in his mind , to say nothing of the wounded Muhammad . Damri said he & ldquo;immediately denounced , and always vigorously denounces , any harming of innocent persons , regardless of religion or origin . & rdquo ; This goes , he said , for needless acts of violence on either side . Representatives from Avigail and Havat Maon went to visit the boy , Damri said , adding that & ldquo;I , too , as the local elected leader of our Jewish community , asked the child&rsquo;s family if I could visit . The family politely refused & ndash ; concerned that the Palestinian Authority would retaliate against them . & rdquo ; Avigail resident Reut Malichi said she had gone to see the three-year-old Muhammad this week , having already visited him at Soroka last week as well . A school counselor and a mother of seven who grew up in the Gush Etzion region , she is among those from Avigail who have a relationship with Palestinians from al-Mufaqarah , particularly with Mahmoud Hamamdeh because of his Hebrew . The community of Avigail is a small , mixed religious and secular community , situated in a complex political reality , she said . Israelis and Palestinians in this area live together , side by side , and have to be good neighbors , even though they hold diametrically opposed beliefs , including on their relationship to the land , Malichi said . The Palestinians do not recognize the State of Israel and do not want the Jews living on land that they hold belongs to them , she added . In turn , she said , & ldquo;we are Zionists and we are returning to . . . the land of the Bible . & rdquo ; Initially , Malichi said , she was unaware of the attack , as she celebrated the holiday with her family , with a barbecue lunch after services , which included her mother and some of her siblings . Malichi learned about the violence , she said , mostly after the fact . She blamed the incident on a group of teenagers that visited the community for the holiday , explaining that it did not represent the people of Avigail itself . The teenagers were not properly supervised , she explained . Already when she met them over the holiday , she feared for a situation that could get out of control . Malichi was also able to speak with the teenagers after the incident , so she said she understands that & ldquo;they did terrible things . & rdquo ; Malichi added , & ldquo;I am embarrassed to tell you what they told me , and it cannot be justified . & rdquo ; She has already warned her own teenage son that if he ever engages in such activity , she will personally turn him in to the police . & ldquo;I can understand why Palestinians threw stones&rdquo ; in response , & rdquo ; she said . This is not how Jews or the residents of Judea and Samaria should behave , she said . Israelis living here should be a force for peace . & ldquo;Nothing like that has happened here before , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;This land can no longer tolerate the blood , the hate , and we have to help it love us . It is not the path of this nation to live in hate . & rdquo ; & bull ;",settlers versus palestinians : ' this was a battle for our homes '

The ministers were briefed about status and steps taken to protect residents of the area . Roads are closed and bus stations are heavily secured in the areas surrounding the Gaza Strip , as Israeli security forces estimate a coming attack from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad.Security officials in Israel claim that both armed forces and civilians are at risk , as the PIJ might attempt to take revenge for the arrest of Bassam al-Saadi , a senior commander in the organization , which took place in the west bank city of Jenin Monday night . Videos of the arrest showing Saadi dragged on the ground and bit by a dog went viral on social networks immediately after the arrest , causing rage among the terror group supporters . In an unusual step , Israeli security forces published a photo of Saada after the arrest , attempting to prove he&rsquo;s alive and calm down the flames .

It&rsquo;s these actions that require more preparation , & rdquo ; he explains . & ldquo;And it&rsquo;s dangerous because it can easily trigger an escalation .

2020-12-22 20:33:14.363,jpost,"& nbsp;Portugal would relocate its embassy to Jerusalem only when the city is the capital of both the State of Israel and the state of Palestine , Portuguese Foreign Minister Santos Silva told The Jerusalem Post during his two-day visit . His country has no plans to follow the United States on this issue , he said as he sat on the veranda of Jerusalem @ @ @ s King David Hotel , located in the western part of the city . Portugal would contemplate such a move he said , only on & quot;the day when I can put the two embassies in Jerusalem , the embassy of Portugal in Israel and the embassy of Portugal in Palestine . & quot ; When asked if he considered that the location where he sat was part of Israel , he said , & quot;I think it is a matter of fact . & quot ; But when it came to the question of whether he considered Jerusalem to be Israel @ @ @ s capital , he said carefully , & quot;You know the Portuguese Embassy is in Tel Aviv . & quot ; Silva arrived in Israel late Sunday night , on the sidelines of a much more publicized visit by US White House senior adviser Jared Kushner on Monday , followed by a departure Tuesday of a joint Israeli-US delegation to Morocco to sign the initial documents with regard to the normalization of ties between Jerusalem and Rabat . Silva braved the COVID-19 pandemic to travel visit Israel and the Palestinian territories just days before the Christmas holiday , as part of his preparatory work in advance of his country @ @ @ s January ascendancy to the presidency of Council of the European Union . It @ @ @ s a rotating half year position , which his country will take over from Germany . Germany used that position to attempt to sooth over tensions between the EU and Israel on two major issues ; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iran . It invited Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi to a meeting of his EU counterparts and spoke of reconvening the EU-Israel Association Council , which last met in 2012 . Silva in Jerusalem spoke of the need for warm Israel-EU ties and of the importance of an EU-Israel Association Council meeting . He noted the points of disagreement with Israel but said that he wanted to address issues from a place of dialogue . In a manner similar to the Germans , he said that Israel @ @ @ s pledge to suspend the annexation of West Bank settlements in exchange for normalization deals with the Untied Arab Emirates and Bahrain had opened the door for improved Israel-EU relations as well . & quot;It was important that the normalization process meant suspension of the annexation plans , & quot ; Silva said when he spoke with the Post on Monday night . & quot;It allowed us to see future conversation and cooperation with Israel in a much more positive way , & quot ; Silva said . He warned that should Israel backtrack on that pledge , the potential of improved Israel-EU ties would be harmed . & quot;It would be a huge problem for us . It would be an obstacle for deepening the cooperation between the two entities , & quot ; he said . It was explained to him , Silva said , that & quot;normalization was the opposite of annexation . & quot ; Silva spoke positively of the US-brokered Abraham Accords under whose rubric Israeli-Arab deals have been reached . Silva said the Accords breathed life new life into the region and the frozen peace process with the Palestinians . The entry of US President-elect Joe Biden to the White House would also open new possibilities in that sphere , he said . & quot;We have to look carefully at the recent changes in the region , and then we have to create conditions for the relaunch of direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians , & quot ; he said . & quot;Palestinians and Israelis&quot ; need this , Silva said , adding that the EU wants to help facilitate this process . It was a message that he carried with him when he went to Ramallah on Tuesday before flying back to Portugal in the late afternoon . Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Muhammed Shtayyeh and PA Foreign Minister Riyad Malki both asked that Portugal unilaterally recognize Palestinian statehood . It @ @ @ s a request that Portugal has rebuffed because it believes that such a step should only be taken by consensus with the entire European Union , and at present the bloc is divided on the issue . The Portuguese parliament has called on its government to recognize Palestinian statehood ; But to date the EU and the Portuguese government hold that Palestinian statehood recognition could only come upon completion of a final status agreement for a two-state resolution to the conflict . But Portugal and the EU agree with the PA that the contours of a two-state solution should be based on the pre-1967 lines with east Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital . Both Portugal and the EU oppose Israeli settlement activity . Silva spoke with Post about this disagreement , explaining that his country and the EU oppose all settlement activity and the Israeli practice of demolishing illegal Palestinian structures . & quot;We have to pursue our Israeli friends not to pursue the demolitions , & quot ; Silva said , adding that he was particularly concerned by Israel @ @ @ s demolition of EU-funded structures for Palestinians . The EU @ @ @ s decision to pursue such building without permits , which are difficult to obtain , has been a point of contention between the EU and Israel . He noted that despite the disagreements with Israel , he held the relations between the two countries to be very important , both because of the historic ties , and because of the contemporary ties and similar characteristic . & quot;We are close countries , & quot ; he said .",portuguese fm : we @ @ @ ll move embassy when jerusalem is capital of two states
2022-06-13 17:01:50.387,jpost,"The Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center on Monday published a report explaining why Hamas did not fire rockets in response to the Jerusalem flag march last month , despite threatening to do so.The decision to back off its threat was multipronged , according to the intelligence center&rsquo;s report , which was prepared by former senior Israeli intelligence people who have ongoing contacts with current Israeli intelligence officials.The reasonsFirst , Hamas said it had succeeded in getting Israel to change the path of the march to a less provocative one as far as al-Aqsa Mosque was concerned . Even though Israel never intended that the flag march route would go near the mosque , Hamas made the statement for propaganda purposes , the report said.Second , Hamas said Israel was extraordinarily well prepared both because it was carrying out a major national IDF training exercise and was on heightened security alert following the Hamas threats . This meant that Hamas would be unable to achieve a surprise as it did in May 2021.Third , Hamas said many countries had begged it not to fire rockets . Although the Gaza Strip&rsquo;s rulers said they had not been influenced by these appeals , their spin doctors put forth the communications as evidence of the increased stature of the organization in the region.As time went on , Hamas became more defensive as it endured more verbal attacks from various groups in Gaza for having failed to follow through on its threat.Hamas restated some of its original defenses for not having attacked in a more apologetic manner , but it also said it was not the right time to put the Gaza Strip through an entire wide round of conflict with Israel following the May 2021 war.Hamas officials said the terrorist group did fire eight rockets on May 28 , the day before the flag march , into the sea , demonstrating that it still had rocket-firing capabilities.Israel responded to that demonstration by sending messages to Hamas that it had no intention of escalating the flag march issue , but if Hamas actually fired on Israel , it would face extreme repercussions.Part of Hamas&rsquo;s problem was that its leader in the Gaza Strip , Yahya Sinwar , made a very strong speech on April 30 that appeared to directly commit it to conflict with Israel.Ultimately , Hamas&rsquo;s true intentions were not to get Gaza drawn into another conflict , but rather to try to incite east Jerusalem residents , Arab-Israelis and West Bank Palestinians into a conflict with Israel over the flag march , the Meir Amit Center said.In addition , though it is still too early to say , the spring spike in terrorist attacks seemed to wane in mid - and late May , and this may have influenced any Hamas plans to inflame the situation , the report said .",why didn’t hamas fire rockets at the jerusalem flag march ? - intel report

Only a year ago , a fifth grade Islamic Education textbook was removed as it compared the Yom Kippur War to the Muslim Prophet Mohammed&rsquo;s wars against Jews of Arabia.The removed book also used antisemitic stereotypes , assigning evil deeds , disloyalty and fraud to Jewish people collectively . Specifically , the books described & ldquo;the Jews are people of treachery and betrayal , & rdquo ; emphasizing that & ldquo;they are always like this&rdquo ; and asked students to use the internet to search for Qur&rsquo;anic verses about & ldquo;the treachery of the Jews . "" The textbook also didn&rsquo;t refer to & lsquo;Israel&rsquo ; , rather substituted the name for & ldquo;enemies&rdquo ; and & ldquo;usurping Jews . & rdquo;Under the new version of the textbook , lessons celebrate an underlining tolerance and coexistence between Jews and Muslims.IMPACT-se Marcus Sheff commented that & ldquo;The fiftieth anniversary of the Yom Kippur War gives opportunity to reflect on Israel-Egyptian relations today . While the Israel-Egypt peace agreement & nbsp;has often been viewed as a & lsquo;cold&rsquo ; peace , this report shows how Egypt&rsquo;s textbook reform is increasingly promoting the values of peace , tolerance and respect for Israel . & nbsp;This offers hope for a warmer , closer peace between the two peoples .

2022-04-28 06:24:16.103,jpost,"Israel will not hold discussions with Jordan about the status quo on the Temple Mount in the coming weeks in light of Amman&rsquo;s incitement against Israel , a senior Israeli diplomatic official said on Thursday.The official referred to Jordanian Prime Minister Bisher Al-Khasawneh&rsquo;s praise for Palestinians who physically attacked Israelis amid rioting on the Temple Mount , and spoke after Jordan submitted a paper to the US calling for Israel to relinquish control of the holy site.Though Foreign Minister Yair Lapid and Defense Minister Benny Gantz met with Jordanian King Abdullah II ahead of the Muslim month of Ramadan to try to lower tensions , Israel views Jordan as having been obstructive to the aim of bringing calm to Jerusalem in recent weeks , especially in light of Khasawneh&rsquo;s remarks amid Palestinian rioting when Passover and Ramadan coincided.As such , Israel does not plan to hold discussions about the Temple Mount with Jordan , the senior diplomatic source said , until a series of potential dates for Palestinian terrorist groups to incite violence in the coming weeks come to an end : the last Friday of Ramadan this week , Independence Day on May 5 , Nakba Day on May 15 , and Jerusalem Day on May 29 . & ldquo;We&rsquo;re not talking about anything other than getting through this time quietly and peacefully , & rdquo ; said the source , adding that Washington did not convey Amman&rsquo;s demands to Jerusalem , and is trying to reduce tension over the Temple Mount.Jordan told the US it demands that Israel respect the & ldquo;historic status quo&rdquo ; at the Temple Mount , the holiest site in Judaism , on top of which al-Aqsa Mosque was built.Among Jordan&rsquo;s demands was that Israel end restrictions on the number of staff members from the Jerusalem Islamic Wakf , and put the Wakf in charge of all visits by non-Muslims.Visits to the Temple Mount have grown more popular among Jews in recent years , with a record 4,625 Jews ascending the holy site during Passover . Jordan views the increased number of visitors as a violation of the status quo.In addition , small numbers of Jewish visitors have prayed on the Temple Mount , posting videos online of themselves doing so , and bringing journalists along . Lapid and the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office have said there is no Israeli policy to allow Jews to pray on the Temple Mount , but that stopping every Jew from silent worship is not possible . The foreign minister also expressed discomfort last week with denying Jews freedom of worship , though he said the status quo would not be changed.Amman has taken issue with the use of the term & ldquo;freedom of worship&rdquo ; in the context of the Temple Mount because they see it as implying Jews are allowed to pray there.By a longstanding agreement , Jordan&rsquo;s royal family is the custodian of al-Aqsa and exercises that role mostly through the Wakf . When Israel and Jordan made peace in 1994 , Israel committed to & ldquo;respect the present , special role of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem . & rdquo;When Jordan occupied the Old City of Jerusalem from 1949 to 1967 , it did not allow Jews access to the Temple Mount or the Western Wall , despite a formal commitment that it would.Earlier this month , Khasawneh said he & ldquo;praises every Palestinian and Jordanian Islamic Wakf worker who stands tall like a turret , and those who throw rocks at the pro-Zionists who are defiling al-Aqsa Mosque while under the security of the Israeli occupation government . & rdquo;The Jordanian prime minister also repeated the theory , advanced by the Palestinians and firmly denied by Israel , that the Jewish state plans to divide the Temple Mount into separate spaces and hours for Jews and Muslims as it did in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron . That theory was used by groups like Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the past month to spark riots in Jerusalem.Reuters contributed to this report .",israel will not discuss temple mount with jordan after incitement – official

2024-05-01 09:23:15.730,jpost,"The Settlements and National Missions Minister , Orit Strock , criticized the Israeli government over what she claimed was a war being thrown into the garbage for the rescue of a mere few hostages in the framework of a hostage exchange agreement with Hamas , in an interview with Army Radio on Wednesday.Strock said that the government was & ldquo;throwing the [ war effort ] into the trash to save 22 or 33&rdquo ; of the 133 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza.Insisting that her party & ldquo;very much&rdquo ; wanted to bring the hostages home , Strock stressed that a deal like the one currently reportedly on the table would leave the vast majority of the hostages still in Gaza alone and abandoned . & ldquo;The government went to war with a clear decision about the goals of the war , & rdquo ; she said , adding that & ldquo;these goals , which were in writing , included the dismantling and destruction of all of Hamas&rsquo;s abilities in Gaza & ndash ; all of its military , governmental , and economic capabilities . & rdquo;This , she continued , would lead to & ldquo;the creation of circumstances in which the hostages could be freed , and the removal of any threat from Gaza against Israel in the long term . & rdquo;According to Strock , the current negotiation regarding the hostages&rsquo ; release & ldquo;turns its back on all three of these goals , including the creation of circumstances to bring the hostages home . & rdquo;Strock expressed concerns that the deal would result in large numbers of Gazans returning to northern Gaza . Further , the agreement would prevent Israel from being able to restart the war effort after a ceasefire is in place.She added that after a deal like the one being discussed , the only & ldquo;price&rdquo ; a future deal could include would be the overall end of the war . & ldquo;You essentially are saying , & lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be satisfied with 20-33 hostages [ being released ] . & rsquo ; This is a reckless deal . . . we sent out soldiers into battle , some of whom did not come back , and some of whom came back wounded , & rdquo ; said the minister.When asked if the Religious Zionist Party would leave the government if such a deal were signed , Strock responded with : & ldquo;A government that sends out people to battle , that issues call-ups for hundreds of thousands of soldiers who left everything behind and went out to fight for those goals that the government defined , that tells them , & lsquo;you know what ? Drop it .

Bertold Fridlender , who has held the position for the past 12 years.Gordon-Shaag will officially take up her position on July 1.HAC has grown considerably over the past decade , offering BA and MA degrees and doubling its student population , which now stands in excess of 4,500.Gordon-Shaag completed her BA in 1990 at Columbia University with a major in chemistry ( magna cum laude ) . She earned her MSc and PhD in 2002 at the Hebrew University , specializing in genetics and molecular biology.Her interest in vision science developed during her post-doctoral training at the University of Washington and continued at the Hebrew University , where she studied phototransduction.In 2007 , she established HAC&rsquo;s master&rsquo;s program in optometry and directed it until 2013 . She subsequently became the chairperson of the Department of Optometry at the college , serving in that position from 2014-2023 . She was recently appointed chair of the Interdisciplinary Faculty for Sciences , Health and Society.Gordon-Shaag&rsquo;s current research interests are in the cornea , keratoconus , and the etiology of myopia . She has published numerous scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals on these topics.Her studies in environmental and behavioral factors associated with myopia have been aided by a grant from the Binational Science Foundation.In recent years , HAC has undergone significant development in its curricula and research projects and is now in the process of planning future strategies.Gordon-Shag is a great believer in innovation and has taken innovative approaches in her own research.Purim fun in Jerusalem ■ BEARING IN mind that Purim this year will not be quite as merry a festival as usual , Danny Bonfil , chairman of the Jerusalem district division of the Histadrut labor federation , and Avi Edery , CEO of Cinema City , put their heads together to devise a memorable and exciting Purim event , designed particularly to bring some cheer to all the displaced children in Jerusalem who were evacuated from their homes . They came up with & ldquo;Fantasy in the Circus&rdquo ; directed by Yaniv Suissa , which is part of a larger carnival and will thrill both adults and children & ndash ; thereby making it a family affair . It will , of course , be open to the permanent residents of Jerusalem . Entrance is free of charge , which is a real boon to parents of large families.A tribute to a late president ■ THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING Sophie Udin Club of Na&rsquo;amat will hold a memorial tribute to its late president Judy Telman at 1 p.m . on Wednesday , March 27.Telman , who spent more than half of her life in Chicago , came on aliyah in 1983 , joined the Sophie Udin Club and spent many years as its president , continuing until her death on February 26 at the age of 92 . Her friends say that even as she lay dying in hospital , she continued to care for Na&rsquo;amat and its fundraising projects , and to direct the operations of the club.She was particularly interested in raising funds for projects that help advance and strengthen the status of women in the family , in the workforce , and in society.The tribute luncheon , at the Meshanot building & ndash ; corner of Shalom Aleichem and Jabotinsky streets , where Telman was such a frequent presence over the years & ndash ; will be addressed by Na&rsquo;amat National President Chagit Pe&rsquo;er ; International Coordinator Shirli Shavit ; and head of Jerusalem Na&rsquo;amat Ilana Daniel . Telman&rsquo;s son Muki Telman , who lives at Kibbutz Grofit , and Edith Paller , representing the Sophie Udin Chapter , will also speak.Jewish heroines ■ OPINION IS divided as to whether Mordechai or Esther is the true hero of Purim , although conventional wisdom has credited Esther with being the savior of her people . But heroes and heroines often depend on how much one knows of the story . There are some who would give kudos to Vashti , who defied the king by refusing to appear at his banquet . It&rsquo;s not certain whether she was banished or executed by way of punishment , but suffice it to say that she disappeared , and the path was open for Esther . History might have turned out quite differently had Vashti been more obedient . In fact , there would not be a Purim on which to celebrate.Esther was neither the first nor the last of Jewish heroines . We have seen ample evidence of that in the current Swords of Iron war.Many books have been written about outstanding Jewish women . Some have focused on only one ; others , on a group . Former MK Aliza Lavie recently published her book Iconic Jewish Women : Fifty-nine inspiring , courageous , revolutionary role models for young girls . A launch was held in Jerusalem on Monday night at which Lavie engaged in conversation with Elana Sztokman and Yudit Sidikman . As ambitious as writing a book about 59 inspiring Jewish women is , it still has a way to go to catch up with the Encyclopedia of Jewish Women , the comprehensive , historical saga of Jewish women through the ages compiled and written by Alice and Moshe Shalvi , Alice having died right before the Gaza War.Judging by all the female achievers featured at numerous conferences this year , future historians focusing on the same subject will have a hard time deciding whom to include.greerfc@gmail.com",grapevine : eye-opening science

"" The results of the demarcation will be positive for the benefit of both parties , and if the atmosphere was not positive , we would not have followed the negotiation process , "" added Aoun.On Tuesday , Hezbollah-allied Free Patriotic Movement head Gebran Bassil stated that there is a "" serious opportunity "" in the maritime border talks and that the gap in the dispute was narrowing , but stressed that the solutions are "" still not clear "" and that Lebanon should insist on an equation in which Israel would get the Karish gas field if Lebanon gets the Qana gas field . "" Most importantly , the demarcation is to allow us to dig , and this is the right time for Lebanon to implement just diplomatic solutions for it , while using its strengths , and we are not weak , "" said Bassil.Lebanese officials have expressed outrage at Hezbollah's launching of drones towards the gas field , stressing that the country is committed to avoiding provocations during negotiations . "" Lebanon considers that any action outside the framework of the state's responsibility and the diplomatic context in which the negotiations are happening is unacceptable and exposes ( Lebanon ) to unnecessary risks , "" a statement by the office of Prime Minister-designate Najib Mikati office said on Monday.Lebanese media reported earlier this week that US mediator Amos Hochstein had warned Lebanese officials that the drone launches could harm the negotiations.Anna Ahronheim contributed to this report .",idf shot down additional hezbollah drone last week
2024-04-06 21:42:06.567,jpost,"White Bird is a new Holocaust drama that opens in theaters around Israel on Thursday , book-ended by a framing device that features Helen Mirren , and most of it is gracefully done and quite moving.Based on a novel by R.J . Palacio , the author of the best-selling Wonder , which is referenced at the beginning , it has moments of heavy kitsch toward the end , but by then you may be so caught up in the story , that you can forgive the lapses . & nbsp;Were the narrator who tells the story in the framing device anyone other than the incomparable Mirren , one of the greatest actresses of all time , White Bird wouldn&rsquo;t have worked nearly as well as it does . & nbsp;What is White Bird about?The movie opens with a short section showing Julian ( Bryce Gheisar ) , Mirren&rsquo;s grandson , starting at a new , fancy private school in New York . This actor played the same character in Wonder , a bully who tormented the hero because of his facial deformity . At the end of Wonder , he is being transferred to a new school , and in the opening of White Bird , we see him coming home , feeling dejected after a day at that school . The cool kids have rejected him , leading him to be mean to an earnest , uncool minority student who invites him to a political club . When he gets into his apartment , he hears a noise and is startled , not expecting anyone , since his parents are usually out at rich people&rsquo;s fundraisers . As soon as he sees that the unexpected visitor is his grandmother , played by Mirren , we are as pleased to see her as he is . & nbsp;She knows the story of how he bullied the other boy and was made to switch schools , and she chides him for being & ldquo;unkind . & rdquo ; In order to explain to him the importance of kindness , she says she&rsquo;d like to tell him a story about her girlhood in France during World War II , and we settle down happily because if you can&rsquo;t see Mirren on screen every moment , the next best thing is hearing her voice . & nbsp;We then move into the main part of the story , which focuses on his grandmother , Sara ( Ariella Glaser ) at the age of 15 , when she was living in a village in the Alsatian region of France in the early 1940s , where the Nazis were in control but were not harming Jews & ndash ; at first . Sara&rsquo;s mother ( Olivia Ross ) is a teacher and her father ( Ishai Golan , who is very good in a small role ) is a surgeon , and she has a comfortable life . Popular at school , she hangs out with her girlfriends , has a crush on the handsomest guy in the class , and is a gifted artist . Her teacher advises her to embrace her artistic gift and not hide her true self . & nbsp;But soon , there is no hiding the fact that she is Jewish , and after antisemitic laws are passed , her father makes a plan for them to flee . Before he can put his plan into effect , the Nazis and French collaborators stage a roundup of Jews at Sara&rsquo;s school . Hiding in the woods , she is approached by Julien ( Orlando Schwerdt ) , a classmate with a limp due to polio , whose father is a workman , who brings her to see his parents ( Gillian Anderson and Jo-Stone Fewings ) , who embrace her unquestioningly and hide her in their barn . They would have taken her into their home but are afraid that their taciturn upstairs neighbors are Nazi supporters . & nbsp;The heart of the film is the connection that forms between Sara and Julien as she realizes she was wrong to have teased him with her friends and begins to see that she was spoiled and led a privileged existence up until the Nazi takeover . Julien is considerate and bright , and they begin to fall in love , as they sit in his parents&rsquo ; old car , which is parked in the barn , and imagine they are taking trips around the world . There is a white bird that flies in & ndash ; hence the title & ndash ; and they see it as a harbinger of better times . The young leads are very appealing and this section is lovely , although we know it can&rsquo;t last . & nbsp;As White Bird moves along , I couldn&rsquo;t help wishing that the movie had allowed its compelling , mostly young cast and the power of its story to carry the drama , without resorting , in the final 15 minutes or so , to speeches that are so literal they are unnecessary and annoying and a few other quasi-supernatural flourishes , almost a magic realism approach . I know this sort of storytelling has its fans , but I feel that in a Holocaust narrative , it&rsquo;s more effective and more honest to stick close to the truth . However , I understand that this is meant to be a film that will attract teens and tweens , as well as their parents , and so an approach that showed the horrors in a realistic way & ndash ; like in the movie , & nbsp;Son of Saul & ndash ; was not in the cards here . Everyone speaks English with slight accents , too , and you just have to accept that . & nbsp;Despite its flaws , it does not trivialize the Holocaust , and just barely manages to avoid being part of that mini-genre I have named & ldquo;Feel-Good Holocaust Films . & rdquo ; There have been other Holocaust movies that have made egregious and dishonest evasions , softening the horrors in a misguided attempt to attract audiences , such as The Boy in the Striped Pajamas or La Rafle ( & ldquo;The Round Up&rdquo ; ) , which was also set in France . I wrote about La Rafle , in a review titled , & ldquo;The Good , the Bad , and the Cute , & rdquo ; that , & ldquo;A viewer who knew nothing of the true events of World War II would think there was a guardian angel that looked out for sweet young children . & rdquo;In White Bird , at least , it is clear that innocent people , even very cute ones , suffered terribly at the hands of the Nazis and their collaborators , and even paid with their lives . The two likable young leads and Mirren elevate this to a film that does have genuinely touching moments and I hope it will be seen by the young viewers it seems to have been made for . & nbsp ;",' white bird ' : a holocaust movie saved by helen mirren - review

"" Following the identification of the terrorist cell , an IDF UAV fired toward the cell and thwarted them . "" IDF Spokesperson Daniel Hagari late Wednesday night said that three terrorists were killed in the drone strike.Hagari stated that the terror cell appeared to be a mix of Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists.The IDF chief spokesperson said that it was the first time that drones had been used in this manner in the West Bank since 2006 ( near the end of the Second Intifada . ) Despite the clear escalation , Hagari said that no one should jump to conclusions about what the IDF might do going forward.He pushed back on suggestions that now the IDF would for sure loosen its norms and start regularly using drone strikes in the West Bank.Rather , he suggested that as of now , the use of the drone and of helicopters earlier in the week , was decided upon on a case-by-case basis and that the IDF has not yet committed to a major policy change.At the same time , these IDF actions have taken place simultaneously with many top government officials calling for an escalation in the use of force against terror.Hamas ' , Palestinian military factions ' reaction&nbsp;Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said what he called the "" assassination crime "" would not go unpunished .

2021-09-28 20:56:15.887,jpost,"As the conditions of the IDF troops seriously wounded in the anti-Hamas operation in the West Bank continue to improve , a senior IDF medical officer said that the two men might not have survived if not for the quick thinking of the paramedic who treated them . & ldquo;They got the most advanced medical treatment in the world , & rdquo ; the senior officer said . & ldquo;Those two men , anywhere else in the world , would have likely died before getting to the hospital . The chances of getting to the hospital alive were really small . & rdquo ; Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa , where the two men are being treated , announced Monday that their conditions were improving . One of them regained consciousness and is expected to be removed from a ventilator , and has communicated with his family . The other is scheduled to undergo a lengthy operation for his wounds . The two troops , a platoon commander and his soldier , were seriously injured during a firefight in the West Bank village of Burkin when they engaged armed Palestinian terrorists . The IDF&rsquo;s preliminary investigation is looking into the circumstances surrounding their injuries but is leaning towards the possibility that they were injured by friendly fire . One of the men was shot in the chest and lost one of his lungs while the other man was shot in the jaw and stomach . The two are also suffering from shrapnel wounds . & ldquo;They were very seriously injured . . . and from the moment they were shot , the 18-year-old EMT-P went straight to treat them . The time we have to get to an injured person and give them medical treatment is seconds , & rdquo ; the officer said , adding that while & ldquo;most armies around the world have their paramedics in the back , in the IDF they are in the front . & rdquo ; According to the officer , Sgt . T controlled the hemorrhaging of the soldiers to stop their bleeding , performed a chest drainage , and intubated one of the men . The paramedic also did three additional things that saved the lives of the troops : he provided freeze-dried plasma , gave them TXA and actively decided only to intubate one of them . The powdered , freeze-dried plasma given to the troops helped to clot their blood and prevented the badly wounded men from bleeding to death on the battlefield . TXA ( tranexamic acid ) meanwhile helps to stabilize the patient by coagulating the blood . Both were carried in the vest of the paramedic . Then he chose to go outside the protocol and not to do something . & ldquo;Our reflex is to go to someone who is severely injured and intubate them . But , what we&rsquo;ve found over the last decade is that such a decision is not always best . If you have a bleeding problem then intubation might help , but if you are bleeding and have low blood pressure it can actually harm the patient , & rdquo ; the senior officer said . & ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found that with specific types of casualties , intubation actually hastens their deaths because you put pressure on the lungs and heart and reduce their already low blood pressure even more . & rdquo ; Had Sgt . T intubated the second man who had been shot in the lungs , & ldquo;he might not have made it to the hospital . & rdquo ; It was a & ldquo;very challenging scenario&rdquo ; and the paramedic & ldquo;did a really great job under fire , & rdquo ; the senior medical officer said . & ldquo;We all do our best to save our troops . There&rsquo;s no technology in the world that we don&rsquo;t use . We are very aggressive in adopting new technology and even admitting when we are wrong . We keep on changing , all the time . & rdquo ; According to the officer , it took approximately an hour from the time the two were injured until they reached Rambam in Haifa . They were evacuated by helicopter and given several whole blood transfusions while en route . When they reached the hospital , their Ph level was so severe that their lives were at risk . & ldquo;Just imagine what their state could have been had they not received all the treatment that they did in the field . & rdquo ; & nbsp;IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Aviv Kohavi visited the two injured soldiers on Monday and told their families that the two are & ldquo;warriors&rdquo ; who showed & ldquo;great courage&rdquo ; during the operation . & ldquo;It is important for you to know that if we had not stopped this network , of the Hamas terrorist organization , they would have been at an advanced stage and would have carried out attacks in Israeli cities , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;Your sons prevented these attacks . & rdquo ;",conditions of wounded idf soldiers improves in hospital

The Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office did not put out a statement on the content of Monday&rsquo;s meeting.A number of ministers and Knesset members from the coalition publicly criticized protest groups last week after a torch was thrown at a police cavalry officer and after protesters succeeded in evading the police and approaching Netanyahu&rsquo;s private residence on Aza Street in Jerusalem . Some argued that the prime minister&rsquo;s life had been in danger , but the Israel Police denied this . On Saturday night , a man rammed into protesters in Tel Aviv , injuring five people.Netanyahu addressed the events in remarks at the beginning of Sunday&rsquo;s government meeting , saying that & ldquo;most of the people , including me , condemn violence among us & ndash ; rioting and lawlessness , ramming into protesters or attacking police officers , reckless and violent incitement for murder on social media . & rdquo;Police data shows 141 elected officials are currently designated as threatened&nbsp;According to data presented by Dep . - Ch .

Labor MK Gilad Kariv argued that the session should focus not on the protesters but on police use of force against the protesters .

The US carried out retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian-backed forces in Syria in December 2019 after an attack that killed a contractor at K-1 base in Iraq . & nbsp ; In January , US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo acknowledged US intelligence support for Israeli airstrikes in Syria , according to Al-Monitor , a Washington-based news website . Can the US force Iran out of Syria , pondered Jared Szuba in a piece at Al-Monitor last December . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Are we ever going to get to a place where Iran does not have forces in Syria ? & rdquo ; Michael Mulroy , a former US deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East , asked during a think-tank event on December 17 , the report noted . & ldquo;I mean , people that are smarter on this than I have told me , no , that&rsquo;s not going to happen . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;Mulroy , a veteran CIA paramilitary officer who worked on Syria during his time at the Pentagon , suggested that minimizing Tehran&rsquo;s influence in the Levant should remain a US goal , & rdquo ; Szuba wrote . & ldquo ; & lsquo;Maybe we should have a smarter take to it , & rsquo ; he added . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; It is known that the US under the previous administration , including national security advisor John Bolton and secretary of state Mike Pompeo , sought to support Israel&rsquo;s actions regarding Iran&rsquo;s entrenchment in Syria . & nbsp ; Iran rapidly increased entrenchment since 2018 , and Iran&rsquo;s forces have suffered accordingly . A strike in June 2018 hit a KH headquarters in Albukamal . Iraqi media at the time , reporting statements by the pro-Iranian Hashd al-Shaabi , blamed the US and Israel for the strikes . & nbsp ; IN AN interview in January , former US Syria envoy James Jeffrey showcased how Israel and the US are working together in Syria . In Foreign Affairs , the former American envoy on Syrian policy said : & ldquo;US-supported Israeli strikes on Iranian targets in the country further limited the [ Syrian ] regime&rsquo;s military options . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Jeffrey also told Szuba in an interview for Al-Monitor about the US support for Israeli airstrikes in Syria . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The US only began supporting that when I came on board , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;I went out there and we saw Prime Minister [ Benjamin ] Netanyahu and others , and they thought that they were not being supported enough by the US military , and not by intelligence . And there was a big battle within the US government , and we won the battle . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The argument [ against supporting Israel&rsquo;s campaign ] was , again , this obsession with the counterterrorism mission . People didn&rsquo;t want to screw with it , either by worrying about Turkey or diverting resources to allow the Israelis to muck around in Syria , as maybe that will lead to some blowback to our forces . It hasn&rsquo;t . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Supporting Israel in Syria was a pillar of US policy on Syria . & nbsp ; The changeover in US administrations in January led to many questions about whether the US would continue to support Israel&rsquo;s freedom of action in Syria and also whether the US would respond to Iranian attacks . Now we know that the support appears to be continuing and that both Israel and the US are willing to strike Iranian-backed forces or threats in Syria . & nbsp ; Linking Syria to Iran&rsquo;s attacks elsewhere is a key aspect of the strikes over the last several days . That means Iran may be getting a message that if it does something in the Gulf of Oman , its militias could be targeted 2,000 kilometers away . The US appears to have said the same thing . & nbsp ; The idea that the militia units in Syria are responsible for guiding policies that target a ship in the Gulf of Oman or strike at a sensitive location in Erbil appears overwrought . It is the linkage and messaging and context of US support for Israeli actions in Syria that is important . & nbsp ; David Shor , who commentates on regional issues , noted on Twitter in a thread on the attacks : & ldquo;Time will tell before we can ascertain precisely what was attacked tonight in Syria , and whether these targets can be differentiated at all from the hundreds of others targeted over the years in Syria . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; That is a key point , beyond the linkage , of what the strikes have hit and whether this matters to Iran . & nbsp ; Airstrikes have long been part of a larger Clausewitz-style , air-power diplomacy in the region , whereby an action in one place results in a reaction in another . & nbsp ; For instance , Iran was establishing a permanent military base in Syria at Al-Kiswah , a & ldquo;Western intelligence source&rdquo ; told the BBC in November 2017 . Al-Kiswah has been struck several times since then , in May 2018 , June 2019 and in January 2021 . & nbsp ; Airstrikes in eastern Syria on Iranian-linked targets were carried out by Israel with intelligence provided by the US , a senior US intelligence official said this January . & nbsp ; There is now a long timeline from the Kiswah revelations in November 2017 , the warnings about Iranian entrenchment in 2017 and 2018 , the increasing entrenchment , the strike on the Hezbollah killer-drone team near the Golan Heights in August 2019 and then the revelations of increased US support for Israel&rsquo;s actions in 2020 , as well as US airstrikes against Iranian elements in Syria in 2019 and now in 2021 . & nbsp ; The map of Israel-US involvement in Syria is growing and converging on Iran&rsquo;s network of bases in the region , which stretches across its plethora of proxy forces from Iraq to Lebanon . This may pave the way for increased US-Israel cooperation in the region , or at least underpin a shared strategy .",israel-us attacks against iran in syria pave way for increased cooperation

Recently completed in Jerusalem the new scroll will be transferred in coming months to Kyiv&rsquo;s Great Synagogue JCC , Beit Menachem.Zelensky wrote the first letter in the scroll , and Herzog the last , though one suspects that Herzog had a better idea of what he was doing . As the scroll was written while the countries of both presidents had been unlawfully attacked and were at war , the two presidents dedicated the Torah scroll to peace and unity.Unity through Torah : Israel-Ukraine connectionThe initiative for the writing of the scroll came from Chabad emissary Rabbi Yonatan Markovitch , who is also the chief rabbi of Kyiv . Markovitch devotes much time and energy to strengthening solidarity between Israel and Ukraine . The writing of the Torah scroll began shortly after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine , and in writing the first letter , Zelensky returned to his Jewish roots.Herzog is not the only Israeli to have written a letter in the Kyiv Torah Scroll . Among others who have guided the quill are Chief Rabbis David Lau and Yitzhak Yosef , close relatives of abducted Israelis , families of Israeli victims of the war , and families of soldiers who fell in battle in Gaza , as well as prominent rabbis , Jewish soldiers in the Ukrainian army , members of the Jewish community in Kyiv , and various influential Jews in Israel and the Diaspora.The scroll traveled widely in the process of its completion . Present at the moving ceremony at the President&rsquo;s Residence in Jerusalem where the final letter was written , was the Beilin family from Sderot , whose mother Zina Beilin was among the first victims murdered in Sderot by Hamas terrorists on the morning of October 7 . The Beilin family immigrated to Israel from Ukraine and settled in Sderot . Zina was killed moments after leaving the home of her elderly mother Galina Beilin , whom she had visited as soon as the sirens sounded.The grandson of Israel&rsquo;s first chief rabbi , whose name he bears , Herzog said : & ldquo;Throughout thousands of years of exile , wherever they were in the world , the Jewish people united around the Sefer Torah . Even today , we are in an especially challenging period , where the Jewish people and the Western world are defending themselves against enemies who oppose the values of truth and the desire to live in peace and tranquility.Therefore , the integration of impact between the Jews of Israel and the Jewish community in Ukraine constitutes a powerful , multiple force for the survival and continuity of the Jewish people . There is nothing more moving than being a part of writing a Sefer Torah that symbolizes this special unity , especially now . & rdquo;MOVING FROM one monotheistic faith to another . Herzog on Wednesday night hosted an Iftar dinner for close to 140 people.This was the last official event for Kazakhstan Ambassador Satybaldy Burshakov who is concluding his service in Israel , and next week will leave to open a Kazakhstan Embassy in North Macedonia.All ambassadors attending the president&rsquo;s Iftar dinner in the past were of the Muslim faith , or representatives of Muslim majority countries . Not this time .

Although Golan would have liked to have him say something about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with whom Rivlin long ago had a falling out , Rivlin refused to discuss Netanyahu saying merely that some people see themselves as Begin and some as Moses , but that no one is greater or more important than the state itself . Rivlin , who is a keen advocate for public radio on which people of all stripes and opinions can have their say , also put in a good word for the now-defunct Israel Broadcasting Authority.IF , AS war cabinet member Benny Gantz has urged , general elections are held in September , chances are high that a new government would be formed by October 7 , the first anniversary of the cardinal failure of the present government , and the murderous attack by Hamas . This year , October 7 is not on Simhat Torah , but during the Ten Days of Penitence . Whether this occurred to Gantz is a matter of speculation , but since so much of Jewish lore and history are based on symbolism , there&rsquo;s a possibility that it was important to have a new government in the Jewish New Year , replete with all its coinciding factors.WHETHER WE remain conscious of it or not , the experiences of our childhood remain with us forever .

As long as the IDF does not rein in the settlers , attacks such as this one will continue , Palestinians contend . Such attacks , however , are not necessarily linked to a specific action by settlers . Sporadic incidents of rock-throwing and other violent attacks have long become part of the norm in the West Bank . The Palestinian media , almost on a daily basis , reports about the & ldquo;crimes&rdquo ; of settlers against Palestinian civilians , including farmers and villagers . The settlers are accused of attacking houses and vehicles , slashing olive trees , beating villagers and farmers , and destroying crops . Moreover , visits by Jews to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem are being portrayed by the Palestinian media and officials as & ldquo;invasions by extremist Jewish settlers of al-Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; Such reports , depicting settlers as violent & ldquo;colonialists , & rdquo ; & ldquo;aggressors&rdquo ; and & ldquo;armed gangsters , & rdquo ; are one of the reasons why many of them are being targeted almost daily with rocks and firebombs throughout the West Bank . The message : Settlers are legitimate targets because they are part of the & ldquo;occupation . & rdquo ; Statements published by several Palestinian groups , including Fatah and Hamas , also regularly denounce the & ldquo;crimes&rdquo ; of the settlers and urge Palestinians to launch a & ldquo;popular resistance&rdquo ; against settlers and soldiers . In the eyes of young Palestinians , the & ldquo;popular resistance&rdquo ; is a euphemism for violent attacks involving rocks and Molotov cocktails , as well as confrontations with settlers and soldiers . On Monday , Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh , during the weekly meeting of the Palestinian cabinet in Ramallah , condemned the & ldquo;colonialists&rsquo ; organized terrorism against our people . & rdquo ; The settler & ldquo;attacks&rdquo ; against Palestinians were taking place & ldquo;under the eye&rdquo ; of the IDF , he charged . Palestinians who go out to attack settlers and soldiers on the roads of the West Bank are often influenced by the reporting in their own media and the rhetoric of Palestinian officials and spokesmen . The rise in rock-throwing incidents in the past few days may also be linked to the ruling Fatah faction&rsquo;s celebration of the 56th anniversary of its first attempted terrorist attack against Israel , as well as the 33rd anniversary of the First Intifada in December 1987 . Statements and posters marking the two anniversaries emphasized the need for Palestinians to step up the & ldquo;popular resistance&rdquo ; against Israel , specifically settlers and soldiers . Posters circulating on social-media platforms feature masked Palestinians hurling rocks at soldiers , while pledging to & ldquo;continue the struggle until the end of the occupation . & rdquo ; Although the PA recently resumed security coordination with Israel , it does not take any action against Palestinians who engage in & ldquo;popular resistance&rdquo ; attacks against settlers and soldiers . The attacks often take place in areas under Israeli security control , where the Palestinian security forces are not permitted to operate , Palestinian officials say . Besides , the PA , which is already facing criticism for conducting security coordination with Israel , cannot afford to be seen arresting young Palestinians for throwing rocks or firebombs at settlers and soldiers while Palestinian groups are urging people to engage in the & ldquo;popular resistance . & rdquo ;",calls for @ @ @ popular resistance @ @ @ behind upsurge in west bank violence

"" Qaani's comments came just days after a member of the Quds Force who had operated in Syria was assassinated in Tehran , with the IRGC blaming agents affiliated with Israel's Mossad.Multiple clashes have taken place along the Lebanese-Israeli border since the airstrike in which the Hezbollah member was killed in 2020.In August of last year , after Hezbollah fired about 20 rockets towards Israel and the IDF responded with 30 artillery shells towards open areas in southern Lebanon , Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah stated that the clashes were a "" very dangerous development "" and the first of their type since the Second Lebanon War in 2006.The rocket fire came as a Hezbollah response to Israeli airstrikes on southern Lebanon which were conducted in response to earlier rocket fire believed to be from Palestinian groups in the country.Nasrallah stated at the time that no Israeli airstrikes had hit a target in Lebanese territory since the Second Lebanon War , with the exception of what he called "" minor violations "" and an "" ambiguous incident "" between the Lebanese and Syrian borders . It is unclear which incident he was referring to.The Hezbollah leader added at the time that the rocket fire was not a response to the killing of the Hezbollah member in Syria .

2021-02-16 17:12:49.013,jpost,"With tensions rising with Iran , Israel is concerned that the Islamic Republic could deploy up to 200 long-range missiles in Iraq that could be used to attack the Jewish state . Iran is already believed to have hundreds of missiles that can reach Israel . & nbsp ; While the chances of a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran are deemed low , heightened tensions in the North amid the possibility of a confrontation in Syria or Lebanon , could also draw Iran to retaliate . & nbsp ; The rationale for Iran to deploy missiles in Iraq and launch them from there against Israel would be to try and prevent a direct IDF retaliation against targets within Iranian territory . & nbsp ; Israel has reportedly upped its attacks against Iranian infrastructure in Syria in recent weeks . On Monday morning , Israeli Air Force aircraft reportedly struck targets near Damascus , the second such strike within a week . & nbsp ; The airstrike came just as a surprise military drill covering Israel&rsquo;s entire northern region was announced . Dubbed & quot;Vered Hagalil&quot ; , the massive aerial drill , which started on Monday , was launched to help prepare the IAF for a future war with Hezbollah . & nbsp ; Israel does not currently believe that Hezbollah is interested in a new war , but military intelligence is of the opinion that there is a relatively high chance for a & ldquo;few days of combat&rdquo ; between the IDF and the Iranian-backed guerilla organization . & nbsp ; This is believed to be the result of the group&rsquo;s failure to avenge the killing of one of its operatives last summer in an airstrike in Syria , attributed to the IAF . An illustration of this was seen two weeks ago when Hezbollah fired a surface-to-air missile at an Israeli drone patrolling southern Lebanon . Had the drone been hit , Israeli officials said that the IDF would have been ordered to respond aggressively . & nbsp ; During the Vered Hagalil exercise , increased numbers of fighter jets and helicopters are expected to be noticed across the country , and a number of explosions may be heard in northern Israel . The exercise is said to end on Wednesday . & nbsp ; The Vered Hagalil exercise simulates combat scenarios in the northern front , and will test all components in the IAF @ @ @ s core missions , including maintaining aerial superiority , protecting the country @ @ @ s skies , as well as attacking and gathering intelligence .",iran could deploy 200 missiles in iraq to attack israel

2024-04-16 05:16:01.723,jpost,"After a long period in which the Israeli Eurovision song "" Hurricane "" was in ninth place in the betting charts for winning Eurovision , the song rose to eighth place on Sunday.There is a possibility that this increase on the betting tables was due to the outpouring of sympathy Israel received after it was attacked by Iranian missiles and drones late on Saturday evening . & nbsp;An Instagram page that publishes content related to Eurovision published the 10 most streamed songs from the official Eurovision YouTube.In first place , by a large margin , is the Dutch song with 18 million streams , the Swedish song with 4.5 million streams , and Eden Golan's "" Hurricane "" with 4.1 million streams . & nbsp;Last week , the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) , which is responsible for the production of the Eurovision Song Contest , published an announcement regarding Israel's participation in the contest in the context of the Gaza war.In the announcement , they made it clear that the decision on candidates ' participation in the competition is in the hands of the EBU alone and not in the hands of other contestants . They also expressed clear opposition to the abuse or harassment of contestants , on or off the network.The message's publication may have been influenced by the threats directed at Israel's Eurovision representative Eden Golan or the terrorist attack in Moscow in March and the growing fear of terrorist threats at Eurovision.In a statement they published on the networks , they wrote : "" The EBU recognizes the strong emotions stirred by this year's Eurovision Song Contest and the intense debate sparked by the inclusion of an Israeli entry . We would like to stress that any decisions regarding participation are the responsibility of the EBU's governing bodies , not the individual artists .

2021-06-16 22:14:40.717,jpost,"It seemed like we were watching the news on repeat : Jewish nationalists&nbsp;marching through Jerusalem&nbsp;waving Israeli flags as Hamas in the Gaza Strip warned it would fire rockets . Everyone was on the edge of their seats . Less than a month since a ceasefire was signed , was Israel set to go back to war ? & nbsp ; Throughout the day&nbsp;incendiary and explosive balloons&nbsp;landed in southern Israel , igniting more than 20 fires , but no rockets were fired . & nbsp ; Israel had deployed Iron Dome batteries close to the capital , reinforced batteries in the South and had thousands of Border Police officers secure the march . There were several injuries and arrests during the controversial march , but overall the day ended with quiet in the capital . & nbsp ; The Iron Dome batteries that had been deployed close to the capital stayed silent . Instead of rocket-warning sirens , the sirens of fire trucks rushing to the scene were heard . & nbsp ; The way that the two sides handled the day shows just how much restraint they employed , because neither Hamas nor Israel wants to go back to war so soon after the last round in May . & nbsp ; Hamas , which pushed itself into a corner with its threats and promises to the Palestinian people that it is the protector of al-Quds and al-Aqsa Mosque , resorted to its pressure tactics of balloons and night demonstrations along the border , instead of rocket fire . & nbsp ; But the balloons and demonstrations were not launched solely because of the flag march ; the group is also trying to pressure Israel into letting the millions of dollars of Qatari cash into Gaza , as well as restart the fuel transfers into the blockaded coastal enclave . & nbsp ; Hamas knows it cannot afford another war right now , especially with Egyptians in the Strip handling all aid sent . Egypt is an instrumental player when Israel and Gaza go to war , and Hamas knows that angering its neighbor to the south would not be the smartest move on its part . & nbsp ; A key strategic ally for Israel , Cairo had reconnaissance planes in the air over northern Sinai and off the Gazan coast throughout the day , likely to watch for any moves inside Gaza that would point to preparations of rocket fire . & nbsp ; If it wants to , Hamas can keep the quiet ; we have seen that over and over again . And not only did it prevent any fire from its operatives on Tuesday , but it made sure that Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other groups toed the line as well . & nbsp ; But the terrorist group still claimed victory , saying that it imposed a new set of rules on Israel following the 11 days of conflict . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The courageous stances of the Palestinian resistance , and its decisive decisions that forced the Israeli occupation to change the path of the so-called March of Flags away from the blessed al-Aqsa Mosque , change the path of civil aviation , and intensify the deployment of the Iron Dome , confirm the achievement of the deterrence equation it imposed in the Battle of Saif al-Quds , and its success in imposing new rules of engagement on the enemy , & rdquo ; the group said Tuesday night . & nbsp ; THE DAY was a test for Israel under the new government of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett , as well . & nbsp ; Bennett is a known hawk on defense issues . Shortly after he began his term as defense minister in November 2018 , he warned Hamas that & ldquo;no one will be immune&rdquo ; from Israeli military action . The response to the launching of explosive balloons from the Strip would be similar to the launching of rockets , he said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The lawless conduct of Hamas leadership is bringing us closer to fatal action against them . We will not announce when or where , but no one will be immune , & rdquo ; Bennett said at the time . & nbsp ; And he has kept repeating that . & nbsp ; So overnight , IDF jets carried out strikes against empty Hamas and PIJ compounds . They were the first airstrikes since the ceasefire and a warning to Hamas : we will not sit back quietly . But does hitting empty compounds at night do anything to deter the group ? Israeli officials have said over and over again that & ldquo;what was , will not be , & rdquo ; so in order to stay true to their words , the Israel Air Force could have hit a target with more significance . & nbsp ; Opposition MK Israel Katz ( Likud ) tweeted Wednesday morning that & ldquo;for every attack in Israel , targeted assassinations and widespread attacks on Hamas targets should be carried out . Not empty compounds . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Perhaps the Israelis were also walking a tightrope , knowing that widespread attacks in the Strip would not be welcomed by Cairo and could instead lead to a diplomatic crisis that Bennett could not afford so soon into his term . & nbsp ; Both Israel and Gaza have firepower to cause extensive damage , but no matter the threats by leaders in Jerusalem or Gaza , both sides are restrained both by Cairo and by their own internal issues .","hamas , israel do not want war despite threats - analysis"

Dan Diker , President of the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs , at the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference on Monday.Diker&rsquo;s observation prefaced a discussion he conducted at the conference with Mossab Hassan Yousef , & nbsp ; & ldquo;the Green Prince , & rdquo ; son of Hamas co-founder Sheikh Hassan Yousef . Yousef defected to Israel in 1997 and worked as a spy for the Shin Bet until he moved to the United States in 2007 . & nbsp;Diker characterized the Hamas attack of October 7 as a & ldquo;strategic surprise&rdquo ; along the lines of major events such as 911 and Pearl Harbor . & ldquo;At the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs , what shocked us was the glee , the energy , and the enthusiasm for Hamas in the free world , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp;He described the expectations in the US and much of the Western alliance that supports the creation of a Palestinian state & ldquo;on the heels of the worst massacre and mass murder in modern political history on a single day of any democratic country . & ldquo;The free world , in large part , believes that this [ the war ] is an extension of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict . Our understanding , and Israel&rsquo;s understanding as a national consensus issue is completely different . & rdquo;Diker noted that in the eyes of many in the West , & ldquo;Israel has been recast as Hamas , and Hamas , from the point of view of virtue , legitimacy , and justice , has been recast as Israel . This inversion of legitimacy has been taking place over the last 31 years&nbsp;since the Oslo Accords , and it is time that we stop defending ourselves intellectually&nbsp;and&nbsp;morally . & nbsp;We must move from intellectual&nbsp;defense&nbsp;to offense reflected in an assertive diplomacy . & rdquo;Diker presented the results of a JCFA poll released at the Jpost conference that showed that 79 % of Israelis opposed the establishment of Palestinian states in Gaza and the West Bank that could threaten Ben Gurion Airport and Israel&rsquo;s coastal cities . Notably , the poll also showed that 64 % of Israelis rejected a Palestinian state , even if accompanied by Saudi normalization . Diker noted that these findings affirmed the Knesset vote in which an unprecedented 99 MKs opposed US endorsement of a Palestinian state . & nbsp;The second part of the discussion was led by Yousef , who said that the ideological dimensions of the war cannot be ignored . & ldquo;Palestine is a device that the Muslims use as a weapon against Israel and as a weapon against the Jewish people . Fundamentally , Muslims think that Allah hates the Jewish people . & rdquo;Yousef said that it was unacceptable for Muslims to take the side of a terrorist group that committed unforgivable crimes in the name of & ldquo;resistance&rdquo ; and & ldquo;occupation . & rdquo ; He voiced his opposition to a two-state solution with a Palestinian state led by the Palestinian Authority . & ldquo;For those representing a two-state solution , they either want Israel to cease to exist , or they are not aware of this existential threat , & rdquo ; he declared . He added that in his opinion , the Palestinian Authority is an even greater threat than Hamas . & nbsp;Diker announced that the organization is changing its name to the Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs , reflecting its activities in that sphere . & ldquo;We see ourselves as the engine for Israel&rsquo;s foreign affairs , serving as a bridge between the West and the Arab Muslim majority East . & rdquo ; It will lead research-driven strategic and communication initiatives for the security and prosperity of Israel , its & nbsp;Abraham Accord partners , and prospective allies seeking normalization with Israel . & nbsp;The Jerusalem Center for Foreign Affairs sponsored a portion of the Jerusalem Post Annual Conference . & nbsp;www.jpost.com/AC24",jcfa head dan diker : ' we really have to think out of the box '

We should have scored even more , but the players were offside too many times . & rdquo ; & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I came into this game over-confident , & rdquo ; Petah Tikva coach Ron Kozuk said . & ldquo;We made mistakes and we paid a very high price for that . When you make mistakes against a quality club you&rsquo;re going to pay for it . It was not a good game for us and I wanted to change up the formation in the first half , but was unable to . & rdquo;At Sammy Ofer Stadium , Maccabi Haifa got by Hapoel Hadera 1-0 as Gadi Kinda scored the lone goal of the game in the 62nd minute to give the Greens the three points to keep them near the top of the table ahead of their UEFA Conference League round-of-16 , first-leg clash against Fiorentina on Thursday . & ldquo;Last week we saw a lot of very nice goals and terrific play , & rdquo ; Haifa coach Messay Diego said . & ldquo;But this game was a much more difficult and tactical game . However , I am happy that we collected the three points in this tough game ahead of our European match against Fiorentina . They are a very strong team that play in Italy&rsquo;s Serie A , but we will be ready . & rdquo ; & ldquo;There is a gap between the clubs , & rdquo ; Hadera coach Haim Silvas began . & ldquo;We came here to make Maccabi Haifa uncomfortable which we did but they rightfully ended up winning the game . We could have done a bit more on the attack with a bit of pressure and some extra passes , but we made sure to come in prepared for this game . If we didn&rsquo;t , as we have seen with other teams , the result could be much more difficult to handle . & rdquo;Maccabi Haifa was deducted one point on Tuesday in continuing discipline relating to fan unruliness .

Of course I wanted more and we had trouble with their pressure which we couldn&rsquo;t find solutions for . But in a game like this you need to know how to win 1-0 , which we did . & rdquo ; & ldquo;I have to give credit to the team , they really put in a good game and effort , & rdquo ; Beitar coach Barak Itzhaki said . & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like moral victories but I can take away a lot of hope . If we continue to play this way the results will come . We knew that Beersheba was a dangerous team and they have scored many goals . We lost a bit of focus and if we hadn&rsquo;t the result could have been different . & rdquo;Meanwhile , Hapoel Jerusalem slipped by Maccabi Bnei Reineh 1-0 thanks to Jelle Duin&rsquo;s 30th-minute goal as the capital city Reds took the points . & ldquo;We gave out too many gifts to the opposition , & rdquo ; Jerusalem coach Ziv Arie began . & ldquo;It happened at least four times , but we were ready for their dangerous players . We did have some good minutes but we couldn&rsquo;t find the second goal . I generally don&rsquo;t like 1-0 games , but it was tough and it was a good game from us nonetheless . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Over the last while we have been there and want to win but we just haven&rsquo;t been able to do enough , & rdquo ; Reineh coach Sharon Mimer lamented . & ldquo;The team that wanted it more and was aggressive rightfully won the game . We will fight until the end to collect as many points as we can . & rdquo;Elsewhere , Hapoel Haifa defeated Maccabi Netanya in dramatic fashion 2-1 as the visiting Carmel Reds scored the winning goal via an 89th-minute penalty to take the victory and the points.Oz Bilu gave the hosts a quick 1-0 lead in the third minute , but Dmitry Antilevsky headed home the tying goal in the 79th minute to even knot up the score . However , Tomer Yosefi&rsquo;s penalty 10 minutes later handed Roni Levy&rsquo;s team the lead for good . & ldquo;We began the game very poorly , & rdquo ; Levy said after the contest . & ldquo;We spoke about the fact that Netanya would come in blazing as they want to get into the championship playoffs and that we can&rsquo;t be too calm from the get go . We want to solidify our spot in fourth place and even threaten to move into third but we are missing some key players . & rdquo ; & ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the first time that we are on the cruel side of the game , & rdquo ; Netanya coach Guy Tzarfati said . & ldquo;We made some mistakes that cost us and somehow that happens to us week after week . We led 1-0 and we had chances as did our substitutes , but the bottom line is that we lost the game that we should have won . & rdquo;Also , Hapoel Tel Aviv and Hapoel Petah Tikva played to a 0-0 draw as the sides split the points . & ldquo;This is a very bad situation , & rdquo ; Tel Aviv coach Yossi Abukasis said . & ldquo;We are battling and we want to score and win but we are unable too . We are playing without any confidence and we need to collect points in order to stay in the league . We wanted to win but we could have easily lost . & rdquo ; & ldquo;I told the guys that I am proud of them , & rdquo ; Petah Tikva coach Benny Lam said . & ldquo;The fans respected that they ran hard , played with desire and worked , so I am happy with them as well . Sure , we needed an extra pass to score a goal but all in all I have no complaints about their effort . & rdquo;In the Galilee , Bnei Sakhnin and Ashdod SC drew 1-1 to split the points for their efforts at Doha Stadium.Clauido Spinelli nodded in the opening goal to give the hosts a 1-0 lead in the ninth minute , but Stav Nachmani knotted the game up less than a quarter-hour later as each team took home a point for their efforts . & ldquo;I believe that the early goal we scored kind of forced us to play a bit more defensively , & rdquo ; Sakhnin coach Slobodan Drapic said . & ldquo;We should have done that as Ashdod came here to take a point and we wanted to win . However , we just didn&rsquo;t have enough quality to decide the game and I hope that this will not affect our playoff chances . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come to take just one point , but all three from the first moments of the game , & rdquo ; Ashdod coach Eli Levi responded . & ldquo;We came into a tough away game at a very difficult stadium and if we count who had more opportunities it was us .

"" Fuchs also rejected calls for collective punishment against Palestinians , saying that such measures don't help the war on terror and can even lead to further terrorism.In an interview with KAN news , Fuchs additionally rejected claims that the split in the Defense Ministry between Yoav Gallant and Bezalel Smotrich was affecting the IDF's ability to fight terrorism , saying that he hasn't seen any effects from the changes.On Monday , a number of Israelis threw stones at an IDF vehicle near Hagaz junction , lightly damaging the vehicle . IDF soldiers opened a chase after the suspects and fired into the air . After one of the suspects was caught , additional Israelis arrived at the scene and began verbally and physically assaulting the soldiers . The suspects then got into a car and drove at high speed toward the soldiers . An officer at the scene fired into the air and at the wheels of the vehicle in accordance with IDF arrest procedures.On Tuesday afternoon , a number of Israelis threw stones at Palestinian vehicles near the village of al-Mughayir . When IDF soldiers and police arrived at the scene , they fired in the air in order to disperse the suspects who were throwing stones at a Palestinian truck.According to Palestinian reports , the IDF continued intensive checkpoints on the roads leading to Jericho on Tuesday as part of efforts to find the terrorists who conducted the deadly shooting attack in the area on Monday.National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir stated that despite the violence in recent days he had ordered police to continue concentrating efforts to fight crime in east Jerusalem . According to the minister , 52 suspected terrorists were arrested and six illegal weapons were seized in the past four days.Additionally , 224 checkpoints have been set up throughout east Jerusalem . "" We will continue our security policy which includes initiative and determination also in the return of governance in east Jerusalem , "" said Ben-Gvir.Three Arab homes in the Isawiya and Jebl Mukaber neighborhoods of east Jerusalem were demolished by the Jerusalem Municipality on Tuesday , according to Palestinian reports . & nbsp ;","hamas : huwara riots are a ' declaration of war , ' cross all red lines"

However , when choosing a winner , our decision was unanimous . This film pulled us all in from the first few frames , and we felt that we were in skillful hands . It was fiercely executed and superbly performed . & rdquo;Tom Nesher said , "" I don't have enough words to describe the huge excitement , joy , and pride I feel right now . I give thanks to my talented cast , the production , the festival directors Jane Rosenthal and Robert De Niro , who stood up to the pressure and chose an Israeli film for the festival , and the judges who chose it as the winner . "" Come Closer is her directorial debut.Israeli films taking the leadIsraeli films have often won important prizes and critical acclaim at the Tribeca Festival , which was created by Rosenthal , De Niro , and Craig Hatkoff to help revitalize lower Manhattan following the 9/11 terror attack . & nbsp;David Volach&rsquo;s My Father My Lord and Talya Lavie&rsquo;s Zero Motivation each won the Best Narrative Feature Award . Ohad Knoller received the Best Actor Award for Yossi & amp ; Jagger , while Shira Haas and Joy Rieger won Best Actress Awards there for the films , Asia and Virgins , respectively.The Nora Ephron Prize , named in honor of the great American Jewish writer , was given to Israeli directors Ruthy Pribar for Asia and Lavie for Zero Motivation.But this year , Nesher&rsquo;s movie was the only film by an Israeli director chosen to take part in the festival , which prompted concern that the organizers may have bowed to pressure from anti-Israel factions to keep the number of Israeli films competing in the festival low this year . & nbsp;The festival takes place despite Israel-Hamas warThe festival was held this year amid a rise in antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment in the US following the October 7 massacre by Hamas and the war in Gaza . & nbsp;Just days before Thursday&rsquo;s prize ceremony , footage was posted on social media of a New York subway train , reportedly at the Union Square station , where masked pro-Hamas protesters chanted in cultlike fashion that any Zionists should identify themselves and leave the train . & nbsp;Union Square is just a few stops away from the main venue of the Tribeca Festival.The Nova Music Festival Exhibition , which commemorates the more than 360 victims murdered at the Nova Music Festival in Israel on October 7 , as well as the 40 taken hostage , is also being held near the Tribeca Festival in downtown Manhattan.Pro-Hamas protesters demonstrated outside the exhibit earlier this week , carrying flags of Hamas&rsquo;s armed al-Qassam Brigades terror wing and of the terrorist Hezbollah group , and holding signs with slogans that included & nbsp ; & ldquo;Long live October 7&rdquo ; and & ldquo;The Zionists are not Jews and not humans . & rdquo ; Protesters called the exhibit "" pro-genocide Zionist propaganda . "" In addition to being a win for Israel , the prize is a personal triumph for Nesher , whose father , Avi Nesher , is one of Israel&rsquo;s most acclaimed directors . & nbsp;The movie was inspired by the death of her brother , Ari Nesher , in an accident in 2018 , although it is not strictly autobiographical . & nbsp;It tells the story of Eden ( Lia Elalouf ) , a troubled young woman from an upper-class Tel Aviv family whose brother dies suddenly . In the aftermath of his death , she discovers he had a girlfriend , Maya ( Darya Rosen ) , whom he kept hidden from the family . & nbsp;Eden becomes obsessed with Maya and tracks her down , convincing Maya to go with her to Sinai . The two young women are drawn together in an intense bond forged in pain , and their story takes a passionate and dangerous turn . "" In these difficult days , when we see boycotts of Israeli art and huge demonstrations around the world ( and in New York in particular ) , it is a [ matter of ] great pride for us that the film was chosen to be shown at a prestigious festival like the Tribeca Festival , in the heart of Manhattan , & rdquo ; Nesher said in a statement when the film was accepted to Tribeca.The lead actresses , Elalouf and Rosen , are both newcomers , and the rest of the cast includes Ido Tako , Yaakov Zada-Daniel , and Neta Garty . Musician Shlomi Shaban also has a role . & nbsp;Among the film&rsquo;s producers is Anthony Bregman , an American producer who has made indie classics such as Michel Gondry&rsquo;s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , as well as such recent films as Nicole Holofcener&rsquo;s You Hurt My Feelings and John Carney&rsquo;s Flora and Son.Nesher , who has made several acclaimed short films , most recently And Now Shut Your Eyes , and who was a correspondent for Reshet 13 , added , & ldquo;My heart is full of pride for my dear partners in the creation of the film - - the actors and actresses , the crew , and everyone who took part in this long and exciting journey .

2024-04-28 17:24:21.990,jpost,"The mayor of the Israeli central city of Lod , Yair Revivo , penned a letter to the government in which he expresses grave concerns about the escalating crime rate and the influence of local gangs in the city just 15 minutes from Tel Aviv.Revivo noted the lack of action to combat these gangs , both Arab and Jewish , which he said are increasingly armed and pose a significant threat not just to the city but to national security&mdash;and a problem he has been & ldquo;shouting about for over ten years . & rdquo;He pointed out that Arab gangs , in particular , are amassing more weapons and could potentially target civil aircraft with shoulder rockets due to the city's proximity to Ben Gurion's airstrip . This follows reports in Israeli media that police had found a missile and launcher during a criminal investigation into one of the central city&rsquo;s kindergartens , which Revivo noted in his letter , calling it & ldquo;intolerable . & rdquo ; & nbsp;The mayor&rsquo;s letter also questioned the effectiveness of security measures such as the IDF and Shin Bet , continuing , & ldquo;If such a missile is luckily found by the police in Lod , God forbid we are close to the shooting of an El Al plane full of 500 passengers ; a plane that will take off from Ben Gurion Airport near our city , get hijacked , hit directly , and crash . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;Perhaps only such an event can make you wake up ! & rdquo ; Revivo wrote . & ldquo;Unfortunately , there is no need to wait for the drone from Iran ; everything is already here . "" Amid these security concerns , the cityscape of Lod is marked by empty shops and neglected streets littered with trash , signs of a community under strain . Few people are seen outdoors , and the few who are keep a wary eye on those entering and leaving the main roads . The local economy suffers not only from a lack of domestic tourism from Palestinians coming from the West Bank due to Israeli restrictions after the war broke out but also from the absence of foreign tourists.Tensions in LodThe atmosphere in Lod is heavy with silence , broken occasionally by gunshots . The city&rsquo;s social dynamics are further complicated by its demographic composition ; about 30 % of its population is Arab , contributing to a sense of detachment from the rest of Israel and exacerbating the city's challenges . & nbsp;Near the mosque in the Arab part of the city , inside a hookah shop full of Arab customers either living or working in Lod , one of them catches attention for a tattoo of an M16 on his arm , as well as an image of a rose and a person covered with a balaclava on his hand . & nbsp;One citizen , Muhammad , expressed his concern to The Media Line , & ldquo;There is a lot of criminality here . Despite living in East Jerusalem , I work here and come very often after work . With the war currently going on , the situation is getting worse day by day . & rdquo;He added : & ldquo;The situation is not completely under the police&rsquo;s control due to the power of many local gangs . However , I can also say that there is always a stereotype related to us as Arabs . Jews portray us as troublemakers and are racist towards us . In the case of Lod and Ramla , the problem is mostly caused by both sides , not just us . There is , in fact , criminality among Jews too . & rdquo ; & ldquo;I just wish peace for this land and further help for mixed cities , such as Lod , in this process . We should coexist , but , so far , we mainly live separately from one another . & rdquo;In the Jewish part of the city , the situation is the same . & nbsp;Yossi , a Jewish citizen who has lived in the city for seventeen years , told The Media Line : & ldquo;Aside from the security granted by the city , as Jewish citizens , we pay an extra 25 shekel per month each . It doesn&rsquo;t matter about one&rsquo;s salary , but this hasn&rsquo;t brought more police or any changes . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We need to learn to coexist ; we have no choice . It is difficult after the 7th of October to trust one another again . Sincerely , I think that Arabs live overall well in Israel , way better than other Arab countries , & rdquo ; he said.Yossi added , "" Our mayor didn&rsquo;t do the right things here . There is no structural plan for both Jewish and Arab citizens . This exacerbated the distance between the two communities . & rdquo;Gavi , another Jewish citizen , also acknowledged the lack of security in the city . & ldquo;During the night , it is impossible to feel safe going out ; our major promised to everyone better conditions , but this hasn&rsquo;t happened yet , & rdquo ; he told The Media Line . & ldquo;In this state of sort of anarchy , I think that Arab gangs may be capable of throwing rockets from here against planes in Ben Gurion , & rdquo ; Gavi added.Regarding Jewish gangs , it seems that they have lost power over the years and are not as relevant as Arab ones in Lod . & nbsp;Gavi said , "" I know for sure that they do not cooperate . Maybe it was like this at the beginning . Now we see the overall control and power in the hands of the Arab ones . & rdquo;Revivo did not respond to a request for comment from The Media Line .",lod's mayor expresses concern over terrorism in neglected mix arab-israeli city amid rising tension

2022-08-08 19:33:38.610,jpost,"Hours after the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip went into effect on Sunday night , Hamas and Islamic Jihad announced they would not allow Israel to drive a wedge between the two groups.Palestinian sources in the Gaza Strip , however , insisted that the already tense relationship between Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been further strained by the weekend war with Israel that began on Friday afternoon . & ldquo;Many Islamic Jihad supporters are disappointed and feel betrayed because Hamas did not join the fighting , & rdquo ; one of the sources said on Monday . & ldquo;Senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials did not even talk to each other directly during the three days of fighting . They were communicating only through external parties , especially Egypt and Qatar . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad officials did not even talk to each other directly during the three days of the fighting . They were communicating only through external parties , especially Egypt and Qatar . & rdquo;Palestinian sources in the Gaza StripHamas has come under attack by other Palestinians for failing to join Islamic Jihad and other armed groups in firing rockets at Israel.Hamas&rsquo;s critics accused it of throwing Islamic Jihad under the bus by not joining the fighting . They claimed that Hamas , which has been ruling Gaza since 2007 , did not want to engage in another major military confrontation with Israel out of fear of losing control over the coastal enclave.Hamas , they added , is aware that the Palestinians in Gaza are not ready for another war , in light of the heavy price they paid during last year&rsquo;s Israel-Hamas war.Other critics of Hamas claimed that its leaders were not really sorry to see their competitors in Islamic Jihad , the second-largest armed group in Gaza , be dealt a severe blow as a result of the IDF&rsquo;s military strikes.Over the past few years , reports in several Palestinian and Arab media outlets have referred to rising tension between Hamas and Islamic Jihad.According to the reports , Hamas is unhappy that Islamic Jihad is becoming a dominant and independent force inside Gaza.The tensions reached their peak last year after sources there revealed that members of Hamas&rsquo;s Izzadin al-Qassam Brigades detained Islamic Jihad militiamen who were planning to launch rockets toward Israel.Hamas , the sources said , was also worried about the growing cooperation between Islamic Jihad and other terrorist groups inside Gaza , including those linked to the Fatah faction , the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine , as well as tiny Islamic State-inspired cells.Leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad held a series of meetings over the past few months in Gaza and Lebanon , as part of an attempt to ease the tensions and restore the military and civilian cooperation between the two sides.The two groups are now claiming that one of Israel&rsquo;s main goals behind Operation Breaking Dawn was to set them against each other , and that the talk in Israel about Hamas&rsquo;s decision to sit on the fence during the fighting aims to & ldquo;sow discord and division&rdquo ; among the Palestinians.In keeping with this claim , the leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad are now boasting that they actually managed to thwart the alleged Israeli conspiracy to create dissension among the Palestinians.That&rsquo;s why it was important for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and other leaders of his group to call the families of the Islamic Jihad members who were killed during the fighting to offer their condolences.The Hamas leaders also went to extreme lengths to emphasize the importance of maintaining a & ldquo;unified front&rdquo ; in the battle against Israel , to show that their relation with their Islamic Jihad & ldquo;brothers&rdquo ; remains as strong as ever.The assessment among Palestinians in Gaza is that Hamas has emerged as one of the winners from the Israel-Islamic Jihad confrontation . Hamas succeeded in presenting itself both as a mediator and & ldquo;responsible adult . & rdquo;Hamas has good reasons to feel confidentUnlike Islamic Jihad , it did not suffer any civilian or military losses , as it was not targeted by Israel during the fighting.Hamas again managed to reassert its role as a major player in all matters related to Gaza . The Egyptians , Qataris and UN mediators dealt with the Hamas leaders as if they were the legitimate and sole rulers of the Gaza Strip.By staying away from the fighting , Hamas acted as the & ldquo;responsible adult&rdquo ; that places the interests of its people above other considerations.Islamic Jihad&rsquo;s ability to pose a real threat to Hamas&rsquo;s rule over the Gaza Strip has suffered a setback in light of the elimination of a number of senior Islamic Jihad commanders and the tremendous damage caused to its weapons arsenal.Hamas can now take credit for saving Islamic Jihad from being totally destroyed by Israel.Hamas is now hoping to reap the fruits of its new role as the & ldquo;responsible adult . & rdquo ; The ball , as far as Hamas is concerned , is in the Israeli court . Hamas is not going to recognize Israel , but the events of the past few days have again shown that its desire to stay in power remains its No . 1 priority .",islamic jihad-hamas tensions worsened during israeli operation - analysis
2023-10-30 20:43:59.240,jpost,"Israel&rsquo;s expanding ground operation is being watched closely by regional media . On Monday , Arab news reports claimed that Israeli tanks were seen on a major road that connects the south of the Gaza Strip , to the north.The reports prompted speculation in foreign media about the progress of the ground campaign : If Salah a-Din Road is under Israeli control ( along with another major road along the coast ) , transit across the Strip will be cut for Hamas , essentially splitting the enclave into two . These reports have appeared only in Arab media.The success of the IDF ground troops comes amid continued calls abroad for a pause in operations for humanitarian aid , a ceasefire , and the opening of the border with Egypt as an exit , as well as for goods to arrive in Gaza , like fuel.Al-Ain media postulated that Israel reached into central Gaza at its narrowest point , an area of fields between Gaza City and Al-Bureij camp . This area includes the village of Juhr al-Dik and its surrounding fields . The report calls this the & ldquo;soft flank&rdquo ; of Gaza , because there is no built-up area , and it can be easily traversed to the sea . The Al-Ain report reads : & ldquo;From the Zaytoun neighborhood , through the Netzarim Junction , to the Juhr al-Dik area , Israel seemed to be sensing a new phase in its ground operation in the Gaza Strip , on the 24th day of the war . & rdquo;Cutting the strip in twoThe report goes on to note that moving through this area , near Wadi Gaza and also the Salah al-Din Road , presents a stratagem that cuts the strip in two . & ldquo;The distance between the border separating Israel and the outskirts of the Zaytoun neighborhood up to Salah al-Din Street is about three kilometers , and they are uninhabited agricultural areas , and therefore Israeli movement in that area is easy , & rdquo ; the report reads.The report adds that Israel has operated in this area in the past & ndash ; one of the raids last week when Israel entered and retreated from the Gaza Strip . The report says that the area was & ldquo;subjected to artillery shelling from Israeli vehicles and armored vehicles stationed there . & rdquo ; It also says that & ldquo;eyewitnesses spoke of the arrival of Israeli tanks to an area just a kilometer away from the Netzarim Junction , located along the eastern outskirts of the Zaytoun neighborhood , also located on Salah al-Din ; & rdquo ; Palestinians in Gaza posted a video of a tank firing on a car.The Al-Ain further report notes that the Netzerim junction is named for the former Israeli community that was evacuated in 2005 under the Disengagement from the Gaza Strip . As such , Israel is familiar with this area that & ldquo;extends to Al-Bahr Street to the west , & rdquo ; according to the report.It also notes that Israel would have to cut the Rashid coastal road as well . It explains that prior to 2005 , Israel used to have the ability to cut these two roads in order to isolate the area of Gaza and prevent terrorism.Pro-Iran media expressed worry about Israel cutting this key road . Al-Mayadeen ran a report claiming that Israel had not been able to cut the road , based on Palestinian claims of & ldquo;resistance&rdquo ; in this area.Clearly , all eyes are not on central Gaza , and the key roads between the north and south . This is as Israel also presses in from the north , along the beach from Zikim , and also toward Gaza City near Beit Hanun and other areas .",arab news reports claim : israel’s ground op could cut hamas control of key road

However , following Hamas ' murderous rampage in Israel on Oct . 7 and the subsequent outbreak of the war , more than 200,000 Israelis from the northern and southern border areas were displaced from their homes to other parts of Israel , necessitating a shift in the organization's operational approach . & nbsp ; & ldquo;As soon as the war began , we kind of mobilized all the volunteers and the whole network that we had already set up , "" she said . "" We were able to be cooking and delivering 2,500 meals a day , which were for the families who were displaced by the war . We also opened a pop-up shop , which was free . They had really come with nothing , and especially as it started to turn wintry , even if they brought a bag with some clothing , they certainly didn't have winter clothing and coats and things . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Tyberg said that the large-scale displacement has become a pressing issue . Many families who came to Beit Shemesh are from areas that suffer frequent rocket bombardments from the Gaza Strip , but they are not from the border areas that were officially ordered to evacuate , and therefore they are not eligible for hotel stays funded by the government . However , many of those families are from poor socioeconomic backgrounds and cannot afford to pay for extended stays in hotels . Donors sent the organization funds to help pay for such families . & ldquo;Ultimately , we also were able to get a donation from someone in America that enabled us to pay for short-term rentals for some of the families , "" Tyberg said . "" We were calling all the real estate agents if there were any empty apartments and trying to find places for people to stay . & rdquo;Meanwhile , veteran American non-profit organization Anera ( American Near East Refugee Aid ) provides humanitarian and development aid to refugees in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , Jordan , and Lebanon . & nbsp;Sandra Rasheed , the organization's country director for Palestine , told The Media Line that while Anera's operational approach has remained unchanged during the war , it has significantly intensified its efforts to aid civilians in Gaza . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We started almost 55 years ago . It started in 1967 after the [ Six-Day ] war that left so many Palestinians displaced , "" Rasheed said .

All of that was put on hold . & rdquo ; & nbsp;It is estimated that some 1.9 million Gazans , over 85 % of the population , have been displaced in the current war , and the World Health Organization has reported an increase in diseases attributed to overcrowded conditions in the refuge areas . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Since the response started , we have distributed more than 6 million meals to people who have been displaced .

They would suddenly tell us there was a warning siren and hang up , "" she said . "" We would wait by the phone fearing for their lives .

' & rdquo ; & nbsp;In the Gaza Strip , one of the major challenges faced by many volunteers and workers is fear for their own lives . & ldquo;We try to provide the coordinates so that people , so Israel , knows that these are shelters for staff of an American organization working for the displaced , "" Rasheed said . "" But our team have said time and time again that if we're going to die , we're going to die serving our people . We're going to die serving the people that need support . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Rasheed said that fuel is crucial to the organization's ability to deliver food to Gazans . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Our work is reliant on being able to deliver the food to people in shelters , "" she said . "" Having our team go to these shelters and provide the interventions and fuel is more precious than gold right now , and it's one of the hardest things to attain .

2021-05-18 23:34:04.153,jpost,"The current campaign between Israel and Hamas is the fiercest one since the 2014 war . It should end because of several reasons . & nbsp ; Israel&rsquo;s Iron Dome is successful in intercepting rockets , but as the campaign continues , the chances that one or several rockets will cause heavy Israeli casualties rapidly increases . A significant blow , harming dozens of Israelis , might push Israel to launch a large-scale ground offensive , deep inside the Gaza Strip . Such an attack might seek to defeat Hamas once and for all , but toppling its rule would likely force Israel into the position of conquering the Strip altogether , an outcome Israel does not ultimately desire . & nbsp ; The Gaza Strip is a small area ( 365 square kilometers ) , and it has been highly monitored by Israel , making it easier for the IDF to gather vital information about Hamas and other groups there . The IDF also has been training to confront Hamas . Nevertheless , in retaking the Gaza Strip , hundreds of Israeli troops will be killed or injured , fighting their foe above and underground . & nbsp ; Hamas dug long tunnels in the Gaza Strip , preparing itself for war , including as part of an IDF territorial seizure . The fight would therefore not be over after the IDF captured the entire Gaza Strip . The IDF would have to destroy the existing military infrastructure . Palestinian combatants , not only from Hamas , would aspire to harm Israelis , including taking them as prisoners . Israelis in the Gaza Strip would inevitably be targets for ambushes , IEDs , etc . & nbsp ; As in prior similar campaigns , Israel has relied on firepower , mostly through aircraft , to make significant achievements . However , these accomplishments fall short of the chance for complete victory . Since Israel will not retake the Gaza Strip , Hamas will keep its base , recover and produce additional and more sophisticated rockets and missiles with longer range , accuracy etc . Following Israeli strikes , Hamas might need months , and in certain areas , years to rebuild its strength . Hamas , including its naval commando , were hit hard . Overall , Israel managed to inflict Hamas quite a blow in this round . & nbsp ; Israel theorizes that more strikes in the current round will be adequate to cripple the military wing of Hamas , delaying another round , but there is no guarantee of that . Hamas will still have a capability to challenge Israel . & nbsp ; This round started following clashes in Jerusalem , which are capable of occurring again at any time for a variety of reasons . Israel needs to be careful in this matter , but predicting in advance what will ignite riots , let alone another round with Hamas , is a speculative undertaking . The latter can easily rely on friction between Jews and Arabs in Jerusalem as an excuse for striking Israel , producing yet another extended campaign . & nbsp ; Hamas is an Iranian proxy , although independent in many respects . Its self-determination has been demonstrated in several instances , such as when it refused to fight for Assad , Iran&rsquo;s ally , during the Syrian civil war . Nevertheless , Iran recognizes the importance of Hamas due to its location , near Israel , and since it is Sunni . The mostly Shi&rsquo;ite Iran uses this religious factor to present itself as one that assists Sunnis , and not only Shi&rsquo;ite groups such as Hezbollah . & nbsp ; IN RECENT YEARS , Iranian training and knowledge helped Hamas upgrade its missiles and rockets , with the results being shown in this latest round . Iran hereby hits Israel indirectly , as part of the ongoing conflict between them . Israel returns the favor by bombing Iranian targets inside Syria , and by conducting covert operations against Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program . & nbsp ; Israel&rsquo;s most crucial national security concern is stopping or at least delaying the development of Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program . It is a top priority for Israel , more important than any issue Israel has with Hamas or any other national security concern for that matter . & nbsp ; Talks between Iran , the United States , and other powers about containing Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program are ongoing . Israel does not have much leverage in those negotiations , but as long as Israel is occupied with Hamas , Israel cannot focus on what matters most : handling Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program . In that sense , Hamas serves Iran even if Hamas fights Israel for its own reasons . This is another major reason why Israel should end the current campaign with Hamas . & nbsp ; Israel and the United States have close ties , but the Biden administration does not have very friendly relations with the Israeli government . Israel needs its American patron in order to reach the best outcome for the current round with Hamas . Israel relies much more on the United States to make sure the talks with Iran will be effective at restraining Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program . & nbsp ; If Israel annoys the Biden administration with respect to the Gaza Strip , the United States might be less willing to listen to Israel about Iran . The Biden administration lends Israel time in fighting Hamas but it is clear the Biden administration wants this campaign to subside . If Israel insists on persisting with this round , it risks increasing friction with the Biden administration . The Gaza Strip has been under the rule of Hamas since 2007 . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Hamas , due to its mismanagement and eagerness to confront Israel , caused a deep economic and social crisis in the Gaza Strip . Some predict that this area might collapse , driving thousands of desperate Palestinians to infiltrate Israel and ask for help . Obviously , Israel does not prefer this outcome . If Israel continues with this round , the probability of further decline in the Gaza Strip increases . & nbsp ; Many Arab states oppose Hamas , and some , like those in the Gulf , have ties with Israel . Arab states can&rsquo;t openly support Israel in this round , fearing public opinion inside their countries and across the Arab world . Arab criticism of Israel is not as pronounced as it used to be , but this can easily change for the worse . The longer this round is continued , the higher the burden of casualties amongst the Palestinian population will reach , forcing even Arab states that have normalized relations with Israel , to speak and maybe even to act against Israel . & nbsp ; All in all , ending the current campaign will frustrate many in Israel who wish to defeat Hamas . However , Israel should cut its losses , and not extend this campaign , because it is simply not worth the cost and the risks . & nbsp ; Dr . Ehud Eilam has been dealing with and studying Israel&rsquo;s national security for more than 25 years . He served in the Israeli military and later worked for the Defense Ministry as a researcher .

2023-02-26 20:41:34.677,jpost,"Some see the world in one or two dimensions and others in three . When Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , who also has a portfolio within the Defense Ministry , responded to the Palestinian terrorist attack in which two Jews were murdered in Huwara in the northern West Bank by calling for using tanks and helicopters against the Palestinians , he certainly was not thinking three-dimensionally.Nor was National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir , who picked a fight with the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) , which recommended unsealing the residence of a terrorist who killed three Jews earlier in February.These views are indicative of narrow thinking . Lessons from the Second Intifada and the Knife Intifada showed that substantially increased IDF physical presence in West Bank areas , especially Palestinian areas , were part of the necessary mix of ingredients for restoring calm and security.But that presence rarely involved tanks and helicopters & ndash ; blunt instruments for open battlefields or for targeting large , concentrated enemy positions.Those positions do not exist in the West Bank , which does not have the massive volume of rockets , other destructive weapons and well-structured Hamas militias that exist in Gaza.Why won't tanks , helicopters in the West Bank secure quiet with the Palestinians?The Palestinian Authority , while it might not control all areas and might be turning a blind eye to terrorist elements , is actively avoiding conflict with the IDF . Non-PA terrorist elements do not pose anywhere near the same magnitude of threat as Hamas . Neither do they present a useful large target for tanks or helicopters.Militarily , the tactic that worked before , and would likely work now if it needs to be unleashed , would involve huge numbers of soldiers going door to door , with intelligence support from drones.Likewise , despite Ben-Gvir&rsquo;s attack on the Shin Bet , the security agency has been a big supporter of house demolitions to deter future terrorism.However , part of the Shin Bet&rsquo;s rationale is that Palestinians know in their heart of hearts that the agency is focused on families who hold some joint responsibility for the terrorism of their family members.In contrast , the Shin Bet found that the Ramot terrorist from earlier this month was psychologically unstable and that the family did not assist him in any way and might even have tried to temper his violent leanings.A house demolition in that case could just create more terrorists , even according to the Shin Bet , because not a single Palestinian would see it as legitimate.But the Second Intifada was also brought under control by the eventual completion of the West Bank security barrier to limit infiltrations.One problem in a dimension where using force cannot solve everything & ndash ; and tanks and helicopters are useless and impractical to police a long border & ndash ; is that , as IDF sources told The Jerusalem Post , completing those portions of the barrier where Palestinians are still sneaking through into sovereign Israel could take another 18 months.And this doesn&rsquo;t even address east Jerusalem , where there is not any initiative being entertained that could handle the security situation . Arabs from east Jerusalem travel freely in Israel . Even presuming that nearly all of them aren&rsquo;t looking to act against Israel , anyone with violent intentions is unrestrained . Tanks and helicopters are even less relevant there.Sunday&rsquo;s terrorist attack occurred in an overlapping Palestinian area , where Palestinians and Israelis mix , the least secure type of location.The Knife Intifada was partially put down by Israeli security forces using social media and drone surveillance to predict and prevent terrorist attacks by & ldquo;lone wolf&rdquo ; attackers before they happened . Yet , many say another ingredient to ending the Second Intifada was Israel&rsquo;s announced withdrawal from Gaza.In contrast , there is currently no diplomatic dimension ( or & ldquo;carrot&rdquo ; ) on the table from Israel to follow a new Operation Defensive Shield ( or & ldquo;stick&rdquo ; ) , such as then-prime minister Ariel Sharon used.In parallel to demolishing more houses , taking away terrorists&rsquo ; citizenship and calling for capital punishment for terrorists , the current government is also in negotiations with the PA , Jordan and Egypt to try to calm the broader situation before it transforms into another intifada . Part of the & ldquo;deal&rdquo ; that seems to have emerged includes freezing unilateral actions on both sides for some months.For Israel , this referred to new settlements and outposts , whereas for the Palestinians , it might have referred to legal moves against Israel in the UN system.But as those efforts continue , elements of the coalition oppose any dialogue whatsoever with any Palestinians , even though the Shin Bet believes dialogue is critical to restoring security cooperation with the PA.In past years , some intelligence officials told the Post that the PA had helped Israel stop 20 % or more of terrorist attacks against Israel & ndash ; not insignificant numbers . And tanks and helicopters in the West Bank would not make things quieter with Hamas in Gaza.To date , the current government has failed to convince Hamas to fully disconnect itself from issues with Palestinians in other conflict areas.All of this comes down to the idea that using force , and more of it , may absolutely be part of the equation to end the almost yearlong up-and-down current wave of violence.But there will also likely need to be a & ldquo;carrot&rdquo ; in there somewhere , whether economic , diplomatic or both . Might the new deal be enough in this area , or is it inadequate to escape the current quagmire?Other ingredients could be the unfinished security barrier in the West Bank , which will take time , coming up with a unique security solution to east Jerusalem security issues and figuring out a way to restore deterrence with Hamas in Gaza.This would mean the current government will need to try some new and creative ideas on multiple playing fields instead of only doubling down with populist slogans in one dimension.There are many ideas , short of a messianic peace vision , that can help restore calm , and the latest deal might help with that . But tanks and helicopters are either a tiny part or a nonexistent part of the solution .","could tanks , helicopters secure quiet in w . bank with palestinians ? - analysis"
2021-08-12 19:05:25.557,jpost,"The Palestinian Authority condemned Israel&rsquo;s decision to advance plans for building 2,223 Jewish homes in Area C of the West Bank , and said the move contradicts the Biden administration&rsquo;s declared policy of opposing settlement construction and unilateral measures . The Civil Administration is expected to advance plans next week for building the new homes in Area C , which is exclusively controlled by Israel . On Wednesday , Defense Minister Benny Gantz also agreed to&nbsp;expand the Palestinian foothold in Area C&nbsp;by authorizing the construction of 863 housing units in Palestinian villages in the area . The Civil Administration rarely grants building permits to Palestinians in Area C . The PA warned on Thursday against the new settlement projects , dubbing them & ldquo;a clear violation of the Oslo Agreement , which explicitly states that no unilateral measures should be taken by any party . & rdquo ; The PA said that the decision to build new homes for Jews is & ldquo;a violation of all international legitimacy resolutions , foremost of which is UN Security Council Resolution 2334 . & rdquo ; Adopted in 2016 , the resolution expressed & ldquo;grave concern that continuing Israeli settlement activities are dangerously imperiling the viability of the two-state solution based on the 1967 lines . & rdquo ; It also called for a freeze of all settlement activity , including & ldquo;natural growth , & rdquo ; and the dismantlement of all settlement outposts erected since March 2001 . & ldquo;This rejected Israeli decision contradicts the clear American position expressed by President Joe Biden during his call with President Mahmoud Abbas , in which he affirmed the American side&rsquo;s rejection of settlements and unilateral measures , & rdquo ; the PA said in a statement . It called on the Biden administration and the international community & ldquo;to work seriously and immediately&rdquo ; to stop Israel from proceeding with its plans , and warned that the decision will lead to increased tensions and instability . & ldquo;These Israeli measures will not contribute to the American efforts to enhance confidence-building measures between the two parties , & rdquo ; according to the PA . & ldquo;Real peace and security are linked to the extent of commitment to all international agreements and legitimacy . & rdquo ; Azzam al-Ahmed , a senior member of the Fatah Central Committee , said that the Israeli decision shows that Prime Minister Naftali Bennett & ldquo;is not better&rdquo ; than his predecessor , Benjamin Netanyahu . & ldquo;The settlement policy has not changed at all , and the current Israeli government is not better than the previous one , & rdquo ; Ahmed told the PA&rsquo;s Voice of Palestine radio station . & ldquo;Bennett is even worse . & rdquo ; The PA Foreign Ministry also condemned the plan to build new settler homes as & ldquo;theft of Palestinian land . & rdquo ; The plan , if approved , & ldquo;means the confiscation and theft of more Palestinian land and the dismemberment of the West Bank , & rdquo ; the ministry said in a statement . & ldquo;This is an attempt to whitewash and legitimize settlements and beautify Israel&rsquo;s colonial settlement decisions while misleading the international community and world public opinion . & rdquo ; The ministry pointed out that the decision to authorize the Palestinian homes was not an Israeli & ldquo;favor&rdquo ; because these houses were already previously built and inhabited by their Palestinian owners , or are under construction on Palestinian land owned by their owners . & ldquo;The ministry views with great gravity the decision to build new settlement units and considers it a blatant aggression against the Palestinian people and their homeland , and a painful blow to the international and American efforts to revive the peace process , & rdquo ; the statement read . & ldquo;It is also a systematic undermining of the chances of achieving the principle of the two-state solution and a disregard for international legitimacy and its decisions , foremost of which is Security Council Resolution 2334 . & rdquo ; The PA ministry accused Israel of ignoring the positions of countries that demand a halt to unilateral measures and are working to help the Palestinians and Israelis in order to create an appropriate environment for reviving the peace process .

This is the official translation of the resolution presented by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu : & ldquo;In the absence of a change in the national assessment , Israel will act to prevent the collapse of the Palestinian Authority , while demanding that it cease its anti-Israel activity in the international legal-diplomatic arena , the incitement in its media and education system , the payments to the families of terrorists and murderers , and the illegal construction in Area C . & rdquo;The statement added that the prime minister and the defense minister would submit proposed steps to stabilize the civilian situation in the Palestinian arena . These include the construction of a new industrial zone in Tarkumiye , near Hebron , a move supported by the Israeli security establishment . & nbsp;As part of the effort by Israel and Egypt to boost the Palestinian economy , the Prime Minister's Office recently approved the development of a natural gas field off the Gaza coast to be administered by the PA . & nbsp;Why does Israel want to save the PA?According to Israeli officials , the decision to help the PA is aimed at countering the influence in the West Bank of Iran , which backs both Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad . The officials say that the collapse of the PA could cause a similar situation to that in Gaza , where Hamas seized control in 2007 . They argue that the PA&rsquo;s loss of control , particularly in the northern West Bank , has empowered terrorist groups and forced the IDF to conduct counter-terror operations in the territories . & nbsp;Ben-Gvir called the decision to strengthen the PA & ldquo;delusional . & rdquo ; He said : & ldquo;There is no greater absurdity than the fact that a body that encourages terrorism , pays salaries to terrorists and their families , encourages in the education system incitement in favor of the murder of Jews , and takes over territories in Judea and Samaria , will receive a basket of rewards from the Israeli government in the midst of a wave of terrorism . & rdquo;It is worth noting that the Israeli government collects some NIS 800 million annually in taxes for the PA , accounting for up to 70 % of its revenue , excluding foreign aid . & nbsp;On July 10 , the PA rejected Israel&rsquo;s demands for helping to prevent its collapse . & ldquo;Yesterday , the Israeli government came out with decisions concerning the Palestinian Authority on the pretext that they want to offer gestures to the Palestinians , & rdquo ; PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh told a PA cabinet meeting . & ldquo;On behalf of the Palestinian government , we say that what is required of Israel is to halt its aggression on our people , killings , settlements , and the piracy of our money . & rdquo;Established 30 years ago as part of the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords with Israel , the PA has weakened considerably over recent years amid allegations of corruption and incompetence , and opposition to its security cooperation with Israel . As a result , it is facing an increased threat from Hamas and PIJ.PA President Mahmoud Abbas was elected on January 9 , 2005 , for a four-year-term , and the last elections for the Palestinian Legislative Council were held on January 25 , 2006 . It is possible that neither he nor his Fatah faction would win elections in the territories if they were held today , and questions remain about the 87-year-old leader&rsquo;s successor.Recent Palestinian polls show that Abbas&rsquo;s popularity has plunged , with 80 % saying he should resign . & nbsp;According to a poll of Palestinians conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research , & ldquo;For the first time since the creation of the PA , a majority says that its dissolution or collapse serves the interest of the Palestinian people . & rdquo;What does this mean for the future of the PA and Israel ?

2024-03-08 14:00:02.390,jpost,"Women are breaking through more and more barriers to serve in elite IDF units in parallel to the ongoing war.Twenty-three recently passed initial vetting rounds to move toward more specific training programs for potentially serving in elite units . Out of those 23 , eight out of 10 passed from the Five Fingers training organization which focuses on assisting women through these processes.One woman , Li Hochman , from Even Yehuda , has even moved on to potential vetting for the Sayeret Matkal special forces unit.After one vetting session , Hochman told the Magazine , & ldquo;We did more in one morning than many people do in a day . We can really help with our military service . We have a lot of pride . We competed with a group of very large men . This could deter lots of women and cause some anxiety , but if you understand you can do it all and you act with professionalism , then there is nothing you cannot achieve . & ldquo;The sky&rsquo;s the limit . Everything new is challenging . But this is a chance to be a positive influence and an example , & rdquo ; she added.Which elite IDF units are women trying to enter?More of the women are trying to make it into special units like Oketz , which does combat and special operations using dogs ; the anti-tunnel Yahalom unit ; and the 669 Search and Rescue Unit.In general , women have received a windfall in support for elite units following the high levels of performance of a number of IDF female combat fighters and police combat fighters on Oct . 7 and during the Gaza invasion . There is also an increasing number of women in higher ranking career-track jobs in the IDF , with two major-generals , seven brigadier-generals , 51 colonels , and 486 lieutenant-colonels.If before , one of the last remaining objections of doubters was that IDF women could perform stationary guard duty but that when a real war came they would be a liability , all of the data and narratives from Oct . 7 and after suggest that female combat fighters performed at high levels under the most extreme possible conditions.Corp . Maya Atilas of the Gaza Division&rsquo;s Border Defense Unit told the Magazine about her Oct . 7 experience on the southern front.After the massacre , she felt the IDF would have easily let her switch to a lower-risk position , but she insisted on staying , explaining , & ldquo;It was personal for me that it was important to do because also maybe someone would say women would not be able to continue , but I couldn&rsquo;t quit . No matter how hard it was to go back to the lookout post , I will continue . & ldquo;I understand the importance . The combat fighters need us so much . The most significant message for all young women who are afraid of taking this job in the IDF : The mission is so important . It is the greatest pride you can have , & rdquo ; she said.Besides some of the above individual stories , there was also encouraging data months into the war at the end of 2023.According to the data , the number of female draftees seeking combat positions in the shadow of the war broke every pre-war set goal.Regarding female draftees&rsquo ; participation , border patrol units were at 116 % ; battle-related intelligence collection was at 133 % ; artillery was at 132 % ; air defense was at 101 % ; rescue units were at 122 % ; and border police was at 119 % . An additional 12 % of women draftees requested to serve in combat units since the start of the war.In addition , two women passed the vetting process for the elite Air Force search and rescue Unit 669.They have started a 20-month elite training course to join the unit&rsquo;s combat ranks.Just getting to the point where women can be considered for such a unit has been a long and winding path.A petition to the High Court of Justice filed a few years ago helped pressure the IDF High Command into opening some new combat units to women.These included Yahalom and mobile deployment units in the Infantry Corps in summer 2023.That women would be able to compete for spots in the IAF&rsquo;s 669 Combat Search and Rescue Unit was announced in October 2022 and only came to fruition in January 2023.Some groups still view this progress as inadequate.They note that there are other militaries in which women are already allowed to serve in all elite combat units.Still , there is no question that the recent trend , especially since the outbreak of the current war , has led to the integration of more women into units in which they previously could not serve . ",women are shattering the idf elite units ' glass ceilings

That same year Jabari ignored a PA ban and attended the US-sponsored economic conference in Bahrain.Jabari&rsquo;s first iftar included a number of Israeli-Arab business people . In 2020 , he held a virtual iftar event and last year there were a number of Yesha members at the meal.Hebron has a bitter history of Israeli-Palestinian violence , but on Jabari&rsquo;s porch , he and his Muslim and Jewish guests showed another side of relations in the city.Members of the Hebron Jewish community have attended each of Jabari&rsquo;s four iftar celebrations . One of its spokespeople , Yishai Fleisher , recalled for the guests on Tuesday how Jabari had helped him fulfill his mother&rsquo;s wish to have fireworks explode over the Tomb of the Patriarchs in honor of his daughter&rsquo;s bat mitzvah , which occurred just before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.Fleisher recalls that when those in the bat mitzvah party saw the night sky light up they said : & ldquo ; & rsquo;What a coincidence . & rsquo ; I said , & lsquo;No , I organized this , I have friends on the Arab side&rsquo ; and they said , & lsquo;No , no , you don&rsquo;t , you are joking . & rsquo ; & rdquo;The guests didn&rsquo;t believe him , Fleisher recalls , but the friendship is very real . & ldquo;For us , this relationship is very important , & rdquo ; Fleisher said . & ldquo;Maybe for Ashraf it&rsquo;s important , but , for us , maybe it&rsquo;s more important . A lot of people around the world want to accuse us of racism and want to say that we hate Arabs . No , we hate jihadists . We hate people who want to make war against us . & rdquo ; & ldquo;There is a lot of joint activity the two communities can do together to improve the city , & rdquo ; Fleisher said , adding that people like Jabari make such joint activity possible.Attorney Kobi Kamar of Jerusalem , invited by a friend , said he had imagined that he was going to a left-wing event and found himself instead in a room of right-wingers . & ldquo;I have found here a reality I had not imagined , & rdquo ; he said , explaining that it was a reality that did not conform to the stereotypes.Hebron Jewish community spokesman Noam Arnon said that Jews and Muslims had been neighbors in Hebron for centuries and were neighbors as well today . & ldquo;We have to make sure that the future of this area will be a future of peace , & rdquo ; Arnon said.Given the biblical roots of the city that date back to Abraham , Hebron could be a thriving tourist city , Arnon said.Zimmerman said it was important to emphasize that the ties that brought Jews and Muslims together on the porch were those of & ldquo;neighbor to neighbor . & rdquo ; & ldquo;The idea that the rest of the world is looking at this region as Palestinians and settlers doesn&rsquo;t help anyone understand the reality of neighbor to neighbor , & rdquo ; he said .","' peace to you ' : palestinians , israeli settlers share kosher iftar meal in hebron"

The others fell inside Lebanon . & nbsp ; The Coalition of Palestinian Forces in Lebanon , a group representing various Palestinian factions , praised Hezbollah for & ldquo;targeting Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories in response to the aggression that targeted Lebanese territories on Thursday . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; In a statement published in Lebanon , the factions expressed full support for Hezbollah&rsquo;s response and stressed & ldquo;the right of the resistance to confront the Israeli aggression aimed at imposing new equations or changing the rules of engagement . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The rocket attack aimed to send & ldquo;a clear message emphasizing Hezbollah&rsquo;s natural right to respond to aggression , defend the people and the land and prevent the enemy from achieving its suspicious goals , & rdquo ; the factions said . & nbsp ; The attack came at a time when the Palestinians are & ldquo;confronting the continuous Israeli aggression in Jerusalem , the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip , & rdquo ; they said . & nbsp ; Hamas welcomed Hezbollah&rsquo;s attack . The & ldquo;battle with the enemy must continue on all fronts until the liberation of the holy sites and the Arab and Islamic lands , & rdquo ; it said in a statement . & nbsp ; Hamas said it fully supports the right of the & ldquo;resistance in Lebanon to respond to the Zionist aggression and violations . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; In response to Israeli airstrikes on Hamas targets late Friday , Hamas said those who are firing incendiary balloons from the Gaza Strip into Israel will not be intimidated or deterred . & nbsp ; The IDF said it struck a Hamas military camp and a rocket-launching position in the northern Gaza Strip in response to the launching of incendiary balloons . & nbsp ; The Israeli airstrikes will not & ldquo;intimidate the rebellious youth or discourage them from continuing to resist the siege on the Gaza Strip , & rdquo ; Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The rebellious Gazan youth will not submit to the dictates of the enemy and its attempts to impose equations on the Gaza Strip , & rdquo ; he added . & nbsp ; Another Hamas official , Abdel Latif al-Qanou , called on Palestinians in the West Bank to step up the & ldquo;resistance&rdquo ; against Israel . & nbsp ; Commenting on the death of Emad Dweikat , a resident of Beita , near Nablus , who was reportedly shot dead during clashes with soldiers on Friday , he said : & ldquo;The martyrdom of Emad requires the escalation of resistance in all its forms throughout the West Bank in response to the continuous crimes of the occupation against our people .

This particular photo raises numerous questions , according to the official . "" Under what circumstances would someone undress before surrendering their weapon ? "" they pointed out . "" Logically , the weapon should be surrendered first , followed by removing clothes . "" Additionally , the official points out that not everyone there is a terrorist . Some people are questioned in the field and released , while only a few undergo further investigation in Israel.The official concludes that engaging in a humiliation contest with Hamas is not worth it .

2024-03-27 05:26:31.047,jpost,"The politics is getting out of control , and the question is whether it puts the fate of the hostages and the objective of defeating Hamas at risk . & nbsp;White House officials insist that they were taken aback by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s announcement that he was calling off a trip to Washington by a delegation headed by National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi and Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer , after the US refused to thwart a UN Security Council resolution which called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.The Biden administration is familiar with the players in Netanyahu&rsquo;s circle . Hanegbi and Dermer , the latter in particular , are the prime minister&rsquo;s people . US officials acknowledge that with this decision to call off the trip , Netanyahu was & ldquo;putting his foot down , & rdquo ; feeling increasing heat personally from the administration over how he is running Israel&rsquo;s affairs . & ldquo;Minister Benny Gantz was here earlier this month , Defense Minister Yoav Gallant is here now , [ and ] the defense establishments are in constant contact , & rdquo ; a White House aide argued . & ldquo;Calling off the Hanegbi-Dermer delegation is political window dressing by the prime minister . & rdquo;In response to the question of whether the administration was also acting politically & ndash ; by supporting Israel but looking over its shoulder amid the president&rsquo;s re-election campaign to make sure it didn&rsquo;t alienate its electorate too much & ndash ; a White House aide insisted : & ldquo;Israel has no better friend than the Biden administration , in general & ndash ; and regarding Gaza , in particular . & rdquo;On the one hand , the aide seemed to be charging that Netanyahu was not sufficiently appreciating the administration&rsquo;s obstacle course in navigating its policy regarding Gaza , and that calling off the visit to Washington by his delegation only exacerbated the public impression & ldquo;that the two countries are not on the same side . & rdquo ; On the other hand , the aide reiterated that & ldquo;on the ground , our cooperation is not affected . & rdquo;Biden on Netanyahu's governance&nbsp;In a recent MSNBC interview , President Joe Biden charged that Netanyahu was doing more harm than good ; he has also publicly questioned Israel&rsquo;s plans for a Rafah operation . However , a White House aide insisted that the president&rsquo;s endgame remains & ldquo;the defeat of Hamas . & rdquo ; Yet , regarding Hanegbi and Dermer staying home , instead of visiting Washington at least right now , administration officials seem fine with holding high-profile contacts in the US capital with high-level Israeli officials who themselves have tense relations with Netanyahu.The president and his people are aware of domestic issues in Israel , including the resistance by Gallant and Gantz to Netanyahu&rsquo;s moves on the matter of haredi ( ultra-Orthodox ) enlistment in the IDF.Within the Biden administration , there isn&rsquo;t totally smooth sailing either . Officials have acknowledged that Vice President Kamala Harris has been the & ldquo;weak link&rdquo ; in support for the Israeli campaign in Gaza . Yet , said one official , & ldquo;she is toeing the line and in principle supports what the Israeli mission is all about , & rdquo ; even if her pronouncements at times & ldquo;seem more blunt about what Israel is doing wrong . & rdquo;Biden has stronger support for his Gaza policy , say aides , from Secretary of State Antony Blinken , Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin , and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan . Some aides seem to hint that having Harris playing & ldquo;bad cop&rdquo ; with some of her declarations on Israel allows Biden to hope he can placate those who say they would vote for him in November , but are threatening not to do so over what some even call his support for & ldquo;genocide . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Listen , the [ UN ] Security Council called for a ceasefire , but it also called for a release of the hostages , & rdquo ; argued a Biden aide . & ldquo;We have not abandoned Israel , [ and ] we have not abandoned the Israeli mission in Gaza . We have also not abandoned the need for humanitarian aid and working toward the overall well-being of Palestinians in Gaza.Cooperation is key - but difficult in attaining&nbsp ; & ldquo;The question is what is the best way to achieve all these goals ; it is challenging , & rdquo ; the aide said . & ldquo;We want to work with the Israelis . We want to work with them on how to achieve victory over Hamas in general , and how best to achieve the aims of a Rafah operation in particular , but not in a way & ndash ; as both the president and vice president have said & ndash ; that would lead to a civilian bloodbath . And yes , we want the return of the hostages . & rdquo;Biden&rsquo;s re-election campaign advisers continue to watch the Gaza policy closely . The president is said to be feeling the heat over warnings he is receiving that he has a very thin tightrope to walk on : promoting his policy but not risking defeat in November . & ldquo;Gaza is not the only reason for concern , & rdquo ; conceded a Biden political adviser , & ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a big reason . & rdquo;Netanyahu&rsquo;s announcement & ndash ; calling off the visit by the Hanegbi-Dermer delegation to Washington to discuss Rafah policy and how to release the hostages & ndash ; came as the prime minister was battling for his political life , warning coalition naysayers to the proposals regarding haredi military recruitment that if an agreement is not reached , the government would fall.So apparently , the US and Israeli landscapes both currently abound with political window dressing by the two leaders , Biden and Netanyahu . Such behavior is not rare in the political world , but right now , if these maneuvers by the president and prime minister do in fact get out of control , the ramifications could be extremely dangerous and deadly.The writer is op-ed editor of The Jerusalem Post .",american and israeli leaders are engaging in political window dressings - opinion

Mengistu entered Gaza in 2014 , and Hisham in 2015.In June , Hamas released a video of Hisham alive but lying in bed hooked up to an oxygen mask . Hamas , which forcibly rules Gaza , said that Hisham was ill.The Goldin family chose to set out now because Hadar was ambushed by Hamas in a Gaza tunnel eight years ago on August 1 . He was 23 at the time.Tzur told the marchers that the & ldquo;biggest bluff that recent governments tell the public is that there are efforts to return the captives . There are no efforts to return the captives . & rdquo;His family , Tzur said , is & ldquo;not afraid of Hamas . We will reach the Gaza border and broadcast the message that this is one big bluff . & rdquo;At issue for the Goldin family , in particular , is Israel&rsquo;s failure to link the passage of goods into Gaza with the release of the captives.At the start of the march , Simha recited the prayer for a safe journey , and Leah thanked the participants at the end of the first day of the event . & ldquo;We are marching to bring the boys back home , & rdquo ; she said.Despite her inclusive message , much of the publicity around the march spoke of only Goldin , Shaul and Mengistu . This included T-shirts and flags calling for the return of the boys.A spokesman for the march said he had no idea why all the publicity material had not included all four of the men.The Goldin family has been at the forefront of the publicity battle for the return of the men , who are often referred to as & ldquo;the sons . & rdquo;According to a spokesperson for the march , they were the only family members present on the first day , however , representatives from other families are likely to join the march on Thursday and Friday .",israeli gov't can't bring hadar back - tzur goldin at march to gaza

Israel sees the rig as a strategic asset several kilometers south of the area over which negotiations are being conducted , and has warned that it will defend it.The Lebanese government slammed Hezbollah for the launching of the drones , which was done without the government&rsquo;s consent.IDF vs dronesHezbollah is believed to have some 2,000 unmanned aerial vehicles , many of them advanced UAVs from Iran and others manufactured independently by the Lebanese terror group.The Israel Air Force has admitted that identifying and intercepting hostile drones is challenging and considers drones to be one of the top five threats facing the country.The defense establishment is also concerned about the damage to the IAF&rsquo;s aerial superiority over Lebanon due to Hezbollah&rsquo;s long-range missiles and air defense systems.Beirut demands control over tunnel in IsraelAlso on Monday , & nbsp;Hezbollah-allied Public Works Minister Ali Hamieh said that Beirut wants control over a tunnel that goes from Israel into Lebanon built by the British army that has been shuttered since 1948.The tunnel was built between 1942 and 1944 for a railway to link Egypt and Turkey , passing through what was then the British Mandate of Palestine , and Lebanon .

2022-03-10 16:18:35.127,jpost,"& ldquo;Nineteen arrested in large brawl at Soroka hospital in Beersheba , & rdquo ; a headline read in November . A fight broke out between two Bedouin families from Rahat , about 20 km . north of Beersheba . The reason it made the news was the location & ndash ; brawls happen all the time . There are thousands of Bedouin living in the Negev ; their story must extend deeper than crime-ridden headlines . So , who are the Bedouin of the South ? The clash took place in one of the parking lots at Soroka-University Medical Center in Beersheba , with two people being injured . By the end of a long night , which included gunshots and stone-throwing , 19 people were arrested . Beersheba Deputy Mayor Shimon Tuval said at the time that the situation was madness . & ldquo;Not only did we lose Beersheba , we lost the whole country . Shots in a hospital are a redline that cannot be crossed . & rdquo ; Hospitals are not a place for incidents like these and are not equipped to deal with them , Dr . Shlomi Kodesh , director of Soroka , said at the time . The Beersheba Municipality did not respond to a request for comment for this article . Soroka When the incident in Soroka occurred , it was in the context of a string of attacks happening inside or near hospital spaces , which are supposed to be safe and immune . Dr . Zeev Feldman , chairman of the Association of Public Health Doctors in Israel and acting chairman of the Israeli Medical Association , explained to The Jerusalem Post at the time that hospitals are merely a microcosm of society . & lsquo;Lawlessness&rsquo ; in the Negev The lack of governance in the Negev is an ongoing issue , and Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said at the time : & ldquo;We are dealing in an orderly manner with problems that we have already become accustomed to having nothing to do with , that are chronic problems that are used to being pushed off . & rdquo ; & ldquo;If the State of Israel does not protect the land on which it stands , it will cease to exist , & rdquo ; Naomi Linder Kahn , director of the International Division at Regavim , told the Magazine . Regavim is an NGO that describes itself as & ldquo;committed to protecting Israel&rsquo;s land resources . & rdquo ; Land , Kahn explained , is the most basic resource of a state . And the organization , in the 16 years since its founding , has found that Israel fails to protect it in the Negev . According to Regavim , lawlessness leads to abuse in land use , which is significant because the Negev comprises more than 60 % of the landmass of Israel . & ldquo;The land is being chewed up at an incredibly alarming rate by illegal Bedouin construction , & rdquo ; Kahn said . Regavim warned that & ldquo;if we continue on the trajectory we are on right now , we will lose the Negev . & rdquo ; A story within a story & ldquo;There&rsquo;s an entire culture here : Towns , settlements , MKs and even the police play a small part in this story , & rdquo ; Israel Police said . & ldquo;Police [ play the part of dealing with the ] criminal stories , but the story here in the Negev is about cultures . Everyone who lives in the South engages with this dialogue every day . & ldquo;To understand what the Bedouin do , you need to understand their culture . Police are a tiny part in this giant story of Bedouin settlement in the Negev ; talking about [ how the ] police [ should intervene ] gives good headlines , but it is not the story . & rdquo ; In November , the Knesset&rsquo;s Research and Information Center published a staggering report showing that the highest crime rates in the country are in the South . & ldquo;Our worst fear is that the State of Israel created a state within a state . They don&rsquo;t pay taxes , they don&rsquo;t have proper addresses ; people are living off the grid and are not accountable under the law , & rdquo ; said Kahn . On a tour in the area in December , Bennett proclaimed : & ldquo;The law of Beersheba and Rahat is like the law of Tel Aviv . We will continue to act until we restore the sense of security to the residents of the South . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Bedouin community is on the lowest socioeconomic rung in Israel , Kahn said , with there being gaps in education and in infrastructure . & ldquo;These are things they have a legal right to as citizens of Israel , but the money that the government invests in the Bedouin sector is getting lost along the way . & rdquo ; When Bennett went south , he met with Beersheba Mayor Ruvik Danilovich , who delivered a clear message : Stronger governance is needed in the Negev to begin to regulate Bedouin settlements . Danilovich was one of the only town leaders Bennett met with on his tour , catching flak for only going to an observation point that overlooks Rahat and not entering the city itself . Faiz Abu Sahiban , mayor of the largest Bedouin city and the second-largest Arab city in Israel , called the trip an insult . & ldquo;Rahat is a city well inside the borders of Israel , not outside of it . The itinerary of the tour is problematic and disgusting in how it treats a city that is in the heart of the state as a threat . & rdquo ; What would happen if the state intervenes ? & ldquo ; [ We would have ] a completely protected minority that can live fully under the law and protect their own culture , & rdquo ; Regavim said . In Regavim&rsquo;s eyes , there are two steps that are necessary to take to ensure stability in the region : Putting people on the map & ndash ; making sure that everyone is registered to a real address , for accountability and tracking & ndash ; and resolving land ownership disputes . In October , Bennett&rsquo;s government was threatened over a bill introduced by Ra&rsquo;am ( United Arab List ) , later passing in the plenum as the electricity law . The law allows thousands of illegally built homes to be hooked up to the national electricity grid . & ldquo;The government woke up and realized that 300,000 Bedouin are living here [ without proper infrastructure ] and that this is a ticking time bomb . So , the government started to change its tune , & rdquo ; the police said . Beersheba is the fastest growing city in Israel , but it can&rsquo;t grow because of the illegal encampments surrounding it . If that is the case , & ldquo;we&rsquo;re finished , & rdquo ; Regavim&rsquo;s Kahn said . According to the Israel Police , a solution could be found by taking the right approach in the dispute between the two cultures & ndash ; Western-Israeli and Bedouin . & ldquo;Anyone who tries to understand the Bedouin culture with Western eyes will fail , & rdquo ; it said . ■",israel's bedouin : what is the truth behind the crime-ridden headlines ?

Data from 2023 shows a 15 % increase in demand compared to 2022 , according to IAI , and this is expected to continue in the future.IAI CEO Boaz Levy says the company expects the system & ldquo;will have a great impact on [ its ] activities , both internally and externally , first in the aviation sector and then in other IAI activities . & rdquo;The system is now in operation after being tested by all levelsThe system is now in operation after being tested by all levels , from aeronautical division managers to project managers and general workers , and it not only reduces conversion time but also optimizes all the logistical processes and allows for a targeted and horizontal management of errors or challenges.According to IAI , the GCC system allows the company to present the conversion process in real-time to its customers , both new and existing , in a way that was not previously possible and with a degree of detail that was until recently considered impossible.IAI has been converting aircraft for years , including the Boeing 737 , the 767 series , the 777-300 , and the Airbus A330 aircraft , the last two of which are in the final stages of acquiring a license.VP and GM of IAI&rsquo;s Aviation Group Shmuel Kuzi explained , & ldquo;Now that it is in full operation , we expect to be able to reduce the working time on each aircraft , improve the response to our customers , and allow new customers to share in the success and enjoy IAI&rsquo;s converted freighters . & rdquo ;",new iai system optimizes passenger-to-freighter aircraft conversions
2022-04-18 19:03:14.220,jpost,"Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is enraged because Egypt , Qatar and other parties chose to hold direct contacts on ways of preventing further escalation with Israel in the aftermath of the recent tensions in Jerusalem and the West Bank , a senior official with the ruling Fatah faction said.The official , who was not identified by name , told the London-based pan-Arab media outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Abbas & ldquo;did not hide his anger&rdquo ; over being sidelined during the mediation efforts with his rivals in Hamas . & ldquo;These efforts show that President Abbas is no longer the only party that Arabs turn to when talking about the escalation in al-Aqsa Mosque and the West Bank , & rdquo ; the official added.On Sunday , Abbas abruptly called off an emergency meeting of the Palestinian leadership that was supposed to discuss the rising tensions with Israel . The meeting was scheduled to take place in Ramallah on Sunday evening.Palestinian officials said that the PA leadership was called to discuss the implementation of a resolution by the Palestinian Central Council ( PCC ) to terminate all signed agreements with Israel , halt security coordination and suspend PLO recognition of Israel until the Israeli government recognizes a Palestinian state on the pre-1967 lines , with east Jerusalem as its capital.The resolution was announced by the PCC in 2018 and again earlier this year during a meeting in Ramallah.Since the beginning of the tensions , Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , who is based in Doha , Qatar , has been holding a series of contacts with Egypt , Qatar , the United Nations and other parties on ways of averting an all-out confrontation with Israel.Haniyeh was in touch with senior Egyptian intelligence officials , Qatari ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and his foreign minister , and the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland.The Hamas leader also contacted Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit and Oman&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi.On Saturday , reports surfaced in a number of Arab media outlets concerning a truce agreement that has been reached between the Gaza-based terrorist groups and Israel.The reports created the impression that Abbas and the PA were no longer seen as relevant and influential players . In addition , the reports implied that the Hamas leadership was the only address for restoring calm.Following the news about the truce deal , the PA leadership issued a statement in which it said that Abbas and the Palestinian leadership & ldquo;continue their actions at the international level , including sending messages and making contacts with a number of world leaders and international organizations . & rdquo;According to the statement , & ldquo;These contacts aim to brief world leaders and international organizations on the dangerous situation that the Palestinian territories are going through , including incursions into cities , camps and villages , especially what is happening in Jerusalem . & rdquo;The statement was clearly intended to show that Abbas and the PA leadership were not sitting on the fence while several countries and parties were negotiating with Hamas.A PA official insisted on Monday that the Ramallah-based leadership was & ldquo;directly involved&rdquo ; in all the contacts with international parties over the past few days . & ldquo;The Egyptians and Qataris know that the Palestinian leadership is the only address , & rdquo ; the official told The Jerusalem Post . & ldquo;Any attempt to sideline President Abbas and the legitimate leadership of the Palestinian people won&rsquo;t succeed . & rdquo;The official pointed out that Abbas and Jordan&rsquo;s King Abdullah discussed the latest developments in the Palestinian arena during a phone conversation on Monday.Abbas also held similar discussions with Russian President Vladimir Putin , the emir of Qatar and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , he said.But a Fatah official told the Hamas-affiliated Shehab news website that Abbas&rsquo;s insistence on maintaining tight and exclusive control of the decision-making process has created a crisis in the PA.The official claimed that Abbas was only consulting with his confidant , senior PLO and Fatah official Hussein al-Sheikh , as well as the commanders of the PA security forces.The unnamed official also said that Abbas was outraged with the Arab and foreign mediators for ignoring him and talking directly to Hamas.Abbas&rsquo;s decision to call off the planned meeting of the Palestinian leadership raised eyebrows and drew sharp criticism from many Palestinians . It was unclear , however , if the decision was the result of Abbas&rsquo;s reported frustration with the mediators for allegedly sidelining him .",pa’s abbas ‘ outraged ’ as hamas takes center stage in mediation efforts
2024-04-02 15:24:58.993,jpost,"An Israeli court has acquitted the police officer charged with causing the death of 18 - year-old Solomon Tekah of the Ethiopian community , five years ago , Israeli media reported on Tuesday.The police officer claimed that when he arrived with his wife and children at a playground in a grove in Kiryat Haim he broke up a brawl between teenagers , after which the group , Tekah included , threw stones at him and his family.Feeling their lives were in danger , the police officer said he shot at the ground.Despite many versions of the incident , the evidence showed that the bullet ricocheted off the asphalt and hit Tekah.The killing triggered widespread protests in 2019.Tekah's family comments on verdict&nbsp;Tekah&rsquo;s mother stated , & ldquo;We are in pain and live in pain , not only we , the parents , but also our children . For a whole month we and the children did not sleep , we knew that the judge would not convict the police officer . We left the court in the middle because tolerating the judge&rsquo;s words or hearing what he said was impossible . & rdquo;Tekah&rsquo;s father said at the end of the trial , & ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t try , and we didn&rsquo;t think we would get a fair trial from lawyers in Israel . We struggled for four years because we thought we might be able to bring change , but we were deceived . & ldquo;The 13 young people killed from the Ethiopian community were not killed by the brutal Hamas , but by our people , by policemen whom we finance with our money . They were killed because they were black . How can a policeman 30 meters away from the children dressed as a civilian shoot a boy just because he asked who he was and to introduce himself ? & ldquo;There is no police to protect the Ethiopian community and no judge to give us a fair trial , & rdquo ; he added.Leaving court , Tekah&rsquo;s sister stated , & ldquo;Now all policemen have a right to kill , & rdquo ; according to Israeli media.Speaking with Maariv , the Tekah family&rsquo;s lawyer said , & ldquo;The family is disappointed with the results ; we expected to hear a different decision but hope that the prosecutor&rsquo;s office will decide to file an appeal.Judge Ziad Falah said following the acquittal , & ldquo;There is a lacuna in the procedures - in an event in which a police officer is in tangible and immediate danger . . . the policeman has the authority to shoot at the body of the person endangering him , and to forgo all the warning steps preceding the shooting . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Along with this authority , the policeman must reduce , as much as possible , the danger arising from his authority to shoot at the body of the person endangering him , & rdquo ; the judge added . & ldquo;The accused acted in self-defense when he carried out the shooting , which unfortunately led to the death of the deceased , & rdquo ; he concluded.Public Committee Against Torture condemns rulingThe Justice Ministry&rsquo;s Police Investigation Department ( PID ) released a statement which read , & ldquo;The court ruled today that the filing of the indictment by the PID was justified and that the PID acted properly and professionally , both in the conduct of the investigation and at the time of the decision on the filing of the indictment and the management of the case . However , the court found that there was room to acquit the accused for several reasons . We will study the verdict and consider our steps . & rdquo;According to Maariv , the PID was reportedly considering an appeal.The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel said , & ldquo;Once again the system stands up and backs up a violent policeman , who shot to death a young man of Ethiopian origin claiming that he & lsquo;felt a real threat to his life . & rsquo;It seems that as far as it concerns minority communities , any norm or directive that is intended precisely for this type of case , such as shooting warning shots in the air , for example , does not apply , & rdquo ; the committee continued . & ldquo;The wheel cannot be turned back , nor the life of the late Tekah , but it was possible to obtain a little justice for his family and the community from which he comes , with a conviction that would send a clear and resounding message that police violence is wrong and that violent police officers must be brought to justice . In its decision today , the court turned a cold shoulder to the victim and his family and added another injustice to the pile of injustices already caused in this sad case , & rdquo ; the committee noted.Maariv , Yonah Jeremy Bob , and Mark Weiss contributed to this article .",' license to kill : ' court acquits israeli officer who shot solomon tekah dead in 2019

2024-04-27 05:35:53.523,jpost,"The Eurovision 2024 slogan is & ldquo;United by Music , & rdquo ; but Israeli Eurovision fans fear that the true slogan this year may be & ldquo;United by Hate and Antisemitism . & rdquo;It was never going to be easy for Eden Golan , Israel&rsquo;s contestant , to compete in Eurovision in 2024 during the war with Hamas , but the fact that the international song contest will be held this year in Malmo , Sweden , considered to be one of the most antisemitic cities in the world , has made it infinitely more complicated and dangerous for Israel to take part . & nbsp;The war would have affected Israel&rsquo;s participation in any city , but last year , when Sweden&rsquo;s Loreen won the competition with her song , & ldquo;Tattoo , & rdquo ; it guaranteed that the competition would move to Malmo , since the contest is held in the home country of the previous year&rsquo;s winner . & nbsp;A city known for antisemitic threats and harassmentMalmo , Sweden&rsquo;s third largest city , is a port city connected by the Oresund Bridge to Copenhagen , but its location , unfortunately does not ensure that it is cosmopolitan or tolerant . Malmo has a population of a little over 350,000 and there are about 100,000 Muslims in the region . In recent years , the small Jewish community in the city has reported serious antisemitic threats and harassment from Malmo&rsquo;s Muslim residents.Israeli Eurovision contestants have always performed under heavy security , but according to multiple media reports , security measures have been heightened greatly in advance of this year&rsquo;s contest , which will open on May 7 . & nbsp;Golan is set to perform in the semi-final on May 9 . She and the entire Israeli delegation & ndash ; consisting of her dancers , musicians , stylists , and others & ndash ; is said to have been told by the Shin Bet , Israel&rsquo;s security service , to stay in their Malmo hotel rooms at all times , except when Golan is actually performing . & nbsp;While Israelis have always needed security , past Israeli delegations to Eurovision contests have had at least some opportunity to mingle with the other delegations and enjoy the cities in which the contest has been held , an important part of participating in an international competition . But this year , the focus will be on keeping them safe to the exclusion of everything else in the wake of anti-war protests and threats.A recent report by Keshet 12 News correspondents Ohad Hemo and Elad Simchayoff on Malmo revealed a disturbing level of antisemitism among the Muslim population of the city . The reporters and their crew were threatened , assaulted , and spit on many times by Muslim residents of Malmo who heard them speaking Hebrew . Being filmed did not deter these harassers . & nbsp;One Jewish resident of an upscale Malmo neighborhood told the Keshet correspondents that she was alerted to the Hamas attack on the morning of October 7 by hearing cheers from the street that were so loud that they woke her . Yair Elsner , also a Jewish Malmo resident , told them that in the first weeks after October 7 , he would walk from his building to his car carrying a knife to protect himself . & nbsp ; & ldquo;You go outside and you see exactly the same people who did October 7 , but here . There is no difference & ndash ; there is no reason to assume that they wouldn&rsquo;t be able to commit the same atrocities on us here if only they could , & rdquo ; he told them . & nbsp;Keshet reported that seven out of 10 Swedish Jews testified in a recent survey that their lives had become more difficult following October 7 and about half of them said they had considered or were considering leaving the country.Perhaps the most chilling aspect of their report was that guards at a Malmo mosque , who did not realize that the Keshet correspondents were Jewish , told them that they had heard there would be a bomb attack at Eurovision and that everyone they knew was going to stay away from Malmo Arena , where the contest will take place . & nbsp;UNFORTUNATELY , antisemitism in Malmo is nothing new . Fourteen years ago , the Simon Wiesenthal Center issued a travel warning for Jews to southern Sweden and especially to Malmo . In 2015 , a Swedish journalist walked around the city wearing a kippah and a Star of David had to stop filming earlier than planned because so many people threatened him , cursed him , and threw eggs at him . & nbsp;In 2016 , Danish Jewish actor Kim Bodnia quit the hit detective series , The Bridge , which was filmed in Malmo and Copenhagen , saying in an interview , & ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very comfortable to be [ in Malmo ] as a Jewish person . & rdquo;It isn&rsquo;t only antisemitism that is on the rise in Sweden , but lawlessness in general . According to reports , in 2022 , in Stockholm , the number of gun murders was 30 times higher than that of London . & ldquo;These are difficult times for Sweden , & rdquo ; Olaf Kristersson , the prime minister said . & ldquo;Sweden has never seen anything like this before & ndash ; no other country in Europe has seen anything like this . & rdquo;While Sweden may have the reputation of being a clean , prosperous country with great social services such as health care and a high standard of living , in recent years , it has been coping with an epidemic of drug gang violence that includes bomb and grenade attacks . & nbsp;In an article headlined , & ldquo;Sweden&rsquo;s new normal : Bombs in the suburbs on a weeknight&rdquo ; in Politico , Charles Duxbury wrote in early October 2023 : & ldquo;The upswell of [ gang ] violence has been so intense , widespread , and chaotically executed & ndash ; inexperienced teenage boys are often recruited to carry out the attacks & ndash ; that there is a growing sense here that no one is safe from it . & rdquo ; & nbsp;According to The Guardian , in 2023 there were 149 successful bomb detonations and 62 attempted bombings in Sweden , in a country with a total population of about 10.5 million people . & nbsp;THE LAWLESSNESS and antisemitism have combined to give Israeli security the challenge of a lifetime , while the delegation will also have to cope with hostility from other Eurovision contestants . Some artists have called for Israel to be banned from Eurovision , as Russia was following its invasion of Ukraine , but the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) , which runs Eurovision , has reiterated its stance that it is a contest for broadcasters , not governments , and that Israel&rsquo;s Kan broadcaster has done nothing wrong . & nbsp;Yet , despite the threat level , Eden Golan&rsquo;s song , & ldquo;Hurricane&rdquo ; has consistently been in the top 10 in the Eurovision betting tables , considered a reliable measure of success in the contest ; at presstime , & ldquo;Hurricane&rdquo ; was in the seventh spot out of 37 countries . & nbsp;Israel&rsquo;s original choice for its song , & ldquo;October Rain , & rdquo ; was rejected by the EBU . Eurovision&rsquo;s policy is that songs should avoid specific political content and the song was seen as a comment on the Hamas massacre , which it unquestionably was . & nbsp;The new song , & ldquo;Hurricane , & rdquo ; made the lyrics vaguer , although the sentiment expressed is essentially the same . The music video released for the song shows Golan singing at a location that looks much like the Supernova music festival , where about 10 % of the attendees were murdered and taken hostage on October 7 , with dancers seemingly writhing in agony . & nbsp;Israel began taking part in Eurovision in 1973 , even though it is not in Europe , since it would not have been welcomed in a Middle Eastern regional song contest . It took home the top prize in 1978 and 1979 with wins for Izhar Cohen and the Alphabeta for the song & ldquo;A-Ba-Ni-Bi , & rdquo ; and Milk and Honey for & ldquo;Hallelujah , & rdquo ; respectively , and again in 1998 with International&rsquo;s & ldquo;Diva . & rdquo;In 2018 , Netta Barzilai became Israel&rsquo;s fourth Eurovision winner with her rousing rendition of & ldquo;Toy , & rdquo ; and in 2023 , pop star Noa Kirel came in third with her high-energy song , & ldquo;Unicorn . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Golan , the 20-year-old Israeli singer who spent much of her childhood in Russia , where she had a successful singing career , has shown great poise and determination in the face of the threats and hostility . & nbsp;She told Eurovision Fun earlier this week that she had complete trust in her security detail and was excited to compete . & ldquo;This is my dream coming true . Represent my country and do something big in front of the whole world ! & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;This year it takes on a different and greater meaning , to stand there on stage and show that we are here . We&rsquo;ve been through & lsquo;hurricanes&rsquo ; to get to this , I really want to do it and I believe we&rsquo;ll go to the final , but our participation is an achievement on its own , and it&rsquo;s an honor . & nbsp ; & ldquo;This year&rsquo;s show is completely different from any other year and the message is that you trust me . The viewers chose me and they believe in me , which is crazy . I believe that everything happens for the best , and I have strength . All the years of preparation and working on my skills have built me up and made me strong enough for this moment . & rdquo ; & nbsp;In the past , the glitzy production numbers , slick pop tunes , outrageous costumes , and breathless presenters have made Eurovision fun for its millions of fans around the world but this year , the theme of tolerance among nations will be tested . & nbsp;Perhaps in a contest where the performer ranked second in the odds is a Croatian band called Baby Lasagna , we should keep in mind that the it&rsquo;s just entertainment and that the real victory for Israel this year will be the safety and well-being of Golan and the entire Israeli delegation . & nbsp ;",eden golan to face a ‘ hurricane ’ of possible antisemitism in malmo
2023-10-23 20:08:10.260,jpost,"& ldquo;There is not a place in Israel that is safe now . If Hamas is not taken care of , there will literally be no place to go in the country , & rdquo ; according to Israel Defense Forces spokesman Maj . Doron Spielman.Spielman spoke to The Jerusalem Post from Kibbutz Be&rsquo;eri in southern Israel , where over 100 of the community&rsquo;s approximately 1,000 residents were slaughtered on October 7 . Israeli strikes targeting Hamas interrupted the conversation frequently with loud booms.Israel has been conducting airstrikes against Hamas for the past two weeks . The IDF and the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office have discussed the possibility of an imminent ground offensive to cripple Hamas&rsquo;s capacity to function as a government or as a terrorist organization.The last time Israel entered Gaza was in 2014 in Operation Protective Edge , 67 soldiers were killed . Following the recent attacks that claimed more than 1,400 lives , Spielman acknowledged the reluctance to consider further casualties in a war against Hamas . Nevertheless , he believes that the people of Israel will support such actions . & ldquo;This is not Vietnam , 4,000 miles away . The enemy is two miles away , & rdquo ; Spielman said . & ldquo;The sons or daughters who enter Gaza will be fighting for their homes , literally , behind them . The citizens will stand behind us until the job is done . & rdquo;He said , & ldquo;I think it is going to be very difficult and could be very painful . Not taking action could be more painful . & rdquo;However , the IDF and Israel&rsquo;s intelligence community could not prevent the Hamas massacre . In some instances , such as in Kibbutz Be&rsquo;eri , it took troops more than eight hours to arrive to engage the terrorists . This has raised questions whether the country can effectively rely on the IDF to deal with Hamas.Spielman said the troops were caught off guard on October 7 . Yet , & ldquo;when they did show up , they did an excellent job . & rdquo;He said , & ldquo;I think the difference now is that we know our exact mission . Our troops have been incredibly trained . Even before this and now , they&rsquo;ve been training in urban warfare settings . & rdquo;To dismantle Hamas , the IDF needs to go to themIf Israel wants to dismantle Hamas , he said , the country has to go where the terrorists are.What is the mission ? & ldquo;To completely dismantle Hamas , both on a governance level and on the military level , & rdquo ; said Spielman . & ldquo;The idea is that Hamas cannot just pop up again . It&rsquo;s the idea that you&rsquo;re rooting out Hamas . You&rsquo;re pulling the roots out of the ground so that they can no longer have a life force . & ldquo;This is a very complicated , long-term mission that our soldiers are ready for . & rdquo ;","' nowhere in israel is safe ' due to hamas , says idf spokesman"

The Taylor Force Act , passed by Congress in 2018 , restricts some aid until the Palestinians end payments to people jailed by Israel over violent crimes , among other conditions . & nbsp ; Speaking to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday , Acting US envoy Richard Mills said Washington & quot;intended to take steps to reopen diplomatic missions that were closed for the last US administration , & quot ; without giving a timeline . & nbsp ; The legal hurdles underscore the range of challenges Biden may face in restoring ties with the Palestinians and reversing actions taken by Trump , who overturned longtime US Middle East policy with a series of pro-Israel steps including ending US opposition to Israeli settlements in the West Bank . & nbsp ; Palestinians say his actions discredited the longtime US role as chief mediator in their conflict with Israel and further dimmed any chance of a peace deal envisaging a Palestinian state in Israeli-occupied territory . & nbsp ; Palestinian leaders have welcomed Biden @ @ @ s pledges of rapprochement , but while he can reverse some measures through executive orders , others involve laws passed by Congress and are not as easily changed . & nbsp ; Asked for comment , a US State Department official told Reuters : & quot;In administering aid , the Biden-Harris Administration will fully comply with US law including the Taylor Force Act . & quot ; & nbsp ; The official did not comment on whether the Biden administration would look into working around the anti-terror amendment to help rebuild relations with the Palestinians . & nbsp ; TALKS ON A @ @ @ FIX @ @ @ & nbsp ; Talks are ongoing with the administration and Congress about finding a & quot;fix&quot ; to the amendment that would allow the PLO mission to reopen , an American legal adviser to the Palestinians said , adding that the Palestinians & quot;don @ @ @ t have the money to pay&quot ; the financial claims against them . & nbsp ; Palestinian officials declined to comment . & nbsp ; A Biden adviser told Reuters just before the Nov . 3 election that Biden would seek to reopen the PLO mission to Washington but added : & quot;There is a law that could make that more challenging . & quot ; & nbsp ; The anti-terror amendment makes the Palestinians liable for the hefty financial penalty that a US jury awarded against them if they establish or maintain any facilities in the United States , conduct activity on behalf of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority , or make payments to Palestinians imprisoned over violent crimes against Americans , among other conditions . & nbsp ; The jury award stems from lawsuits by 11 American families who sought to hold the PA and PLO liable for shootings and bombings by between 2002 and 2004 in Jerusalem that killed 33 people , including several Americans . & nbsp ; Palestinian leaders have condemned the attacks and blamed them on rogue individuals . & nbsp ; But the US Supreme Court in 2018 refused to consider awarding those claims , upholding a lower court finding that there was no jurisdiction for attacks outside US territory .",biden pledge to reopen plo mission in washington faces legal hurdles
2021-12-31 10:20:31.033,jpost,"The IDF thwarted a stabbing attack against civilians at a bus stop at the Giti Avishar junction in the Samaria region of the West Bank , killing the Palestinian terrorist . No civilians or soldiers were injured in the Friday morning attack . The soldier who shot at the terrorist described the events of the attack in a video that was sent out to the Israeli media . & ldquo;A car stopped near me , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;A terrorist got out of the car wielding a knife , yelled & lsquo;Allahu Akbar&rsquo ; [ God is great ] and ran toward me . I shot in order to neutralize him . & rdquo ; The IDF explained that the terrorist had run in the direction of a bus stop where both soldiers and civilians were standing . The IDF later arrested the man who had driven the attacker to the scene . He was not carrying weapons and was taken in for questioning . Earlier this week , Defense Minister Benny Gantz held a meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in an effort to thwart a violent Palestinian uprising in the West Bank . The rare meeting , which took place in Gantz&rsquo;s Rosh Ha&rsquo;ayin home , was the second one between the two leaders . They had met in August in Ramallah . Last month Palestinian terrorists killed 25-year-old Yehuda Dimentman and lightly wounded two others . They sprayed bullets at a vehicle as it left the Homesh hilltop in the direction of the Shavei Shomron settlement , in the Samaria region . In an interview with Army Radio on Thursday , Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories Maj . - Gen . Ghassan Alian told Army Radio that the situation was tense and that the PA wanted to maintain stability and de-escalate the situation . Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan visited the scene of the attack . After praising the soldiers&rsquo ; conduct during the incident , Dagan blamed the government&rsquo;s policy of not acting strongly enough against terror . & ldquo;The Israeli government , unfortunately , is harming its deterrence and losing it time and time again ; we see this in severe attack attempts , over and over again , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;I call on the Israeli government to wake up , and to learn from IDF soldiers how to fight terrorism . Terrorism is not negotiated , terrorism is not embraced : Terrorism is defeated and terrorism is fought and eradicated . & rdquo ; According to IDF data released midweek , the number of Palestinian shooting and stabbing attacks against Israeli civilians and security forces in the West Bank has doubled to the highest it has been in four years . The data does not include all of December . There were 31 incidents of Palestinians shooting at Israeli security forces and civilians in 2019 , compared to 61 this year . There were also nine stabbing incidents compared to 18 in 2021 . Israeli fatalities , however , remained low . Last year there were two victims : St . - Sgt . Amit Ben Yigal , 21 , killed in a military operation in the West Bank village of Yabad , and Esther Horgan , a civilian who was killed while jogging near her home in the Tal Menashe settlement . This year there were two civilian casualties , both in the Samaria region : Dimentman and Yehuda Guetta , 19 , who was killed at the Tapuah junction .","idf thwarts stabbing attack at west bank bus stop , kills terrorist"
2023-11-19 05:44:18.283,jpost,"Cruelty , suspicion , and complete indifference to the suffering of his family and his people&mdash;these are some of the qualities that are revealed when reading the testimony of Yahya Sinwar , the leader of Hamas in Gaza , from his days as a young and particularly dangerous operative in the ranks of the terrorist organization.The qualities cited here were referenced by Sinwar during a recently revealed police interrogation in 1989 . His quotes give a glimpse into the dark personality of the master terrorist , who did not hesitate to harm his people or anyone he considered to be an apostate from the religion of Islam or a collaborator with Israel.A chilling illustration of this can be found in the testimony concerning the murder committed by Sinwar&mdash;of a collaborator with Israel named Rami Salim . "" I strangled him with a kaffiyeh""In order to get the "" authorization "" to kill Salim , Sinwar turned to the leader of Hamas , Sheikh Ahmed Yassin . Salim was subjected to a violent interrogation at the hands of Sinwar , and confessed to having ties with the Israeli security forces as well as violating religious principles.In his investigation , Sinwar described Salim's execution : "" On the way I blindfolded him with a rag , so that he wouldn't see where we were going . At the cemetery I put Rasmi into the big grave . . . and there I strangled Rasmi with a kaffiyeh I had . Then I suffocated him , wrapped him in a white cloth , in a shroud , and then I went out and closed the grave . "" The same was true of another person , named Adnan Azfur , whom Sinwar also suspected of having connections with Israel . "" We interrogated Adnan , beat him and talked to him , and then he admitted that he was connected with the Israeli intelligence . . . then we decided to kill him . . . and there I strangled Adnan by force , and I . . . dug in the place , and we buried him there , and we each went to our homes . "" In his statement to the police , Sinwar described how the information reached him : "" We received information about one Fathi Issa , from the al-Birij refugee camp , who was cooperating with the authorities . "" Sinwar followed him , kidnapped him , and brought him to an orchard for an ' interrogation ' . ' I stayed with Fakhri and started questioning him . I grabbed his throat with one hand and started choking him , and with the other hand I punched him in the stomach , then suddenly he had a heart attack and died , "" Sinwar told his investigators.Another person who did not escape Sinwar's clutches was a man named Hossein al-Sir Mahan Yun . This is how Sinwar described his exploits to the police : "" While they were threatening Hossein al-Sir , as he started to get out of the car and started to resist , I pressed the gun to his neck so that he would get into our car . Then a bullet was fired from my gun and hit him . "" Sinwar tested bombs&mdash;on Al-Shifa HospitalAnother example of the indifference of the Hamas leader in Gaza to the lives of his people can be found in the following story : In 1987 , Sinwar wanted to experiment with dropping explosive charges . Of all places , he chose Shifa Hospital in Gaza City as a dummy target , which has since become a symbol of Hamas's cynicism and the willingness of it and its leaders&mdash;who according to reports are or at least were hiding under the hospital&mdash;to use the civilian population as a human shield . The explosive device did explode.The quotes that appear here are taken from a High Court decision that rejected the request of Sinwar's father , Ibrahim Hassan Sinwar , that his house not be destroyed due to his son's criminal acts . The retired president of the Supreme Court , Meir Shamgar , rejected the petition with the following prophetic words : "" The severity of Yahya's actions , described above , who strangled to death , with his own hands , people suspected of cooperating with the authorities , is the background to the decision of the respondent , who considered and believed that in this case the adoption of punitive measures is required . There is no reason to deny the reasonableness of this step . "" Indeed , the members of Yahya's family are also now suffering because of his actions , "" Shamgar wrote , "" but this is indeed , more than once , the side effect of any punishment ( such as imprisonment or even a fine ) , which is indeed imposed on the accused , but which hurts&mdash;no less and sometimes even more&mdash;those who depend on him . This alone cannot be used to negate the justification of an act of deterrent punishment , which appears to the respondent to be essential in order to fulfill his duties and responsibilities . The petition is dismissed . ""","yahya sinwar's 1989 interrogation reveals hamas leader's cruelty , ruthlessness"
2021-05-12 16:20:16.310,jpost,"For supporters on the far-left , far-right and among pro-Iran and pro-Palestinian groups in the region , the riots in Lod and other Israeli cities where Arabs and Jews clashed have fueled a growth in support for what they see as the inevitability of the destruction of Israel and the rise of one Palestinian state . & ldquo;Israeli media reported violent confrontations in Lod , & rdquo ; reported Al-Mayadeen , which is frequently pro-Iran in its reporting . The report says Israel was forced to & ldquo;evacuate a number of settlers from their homes&rdquo ; as & ldquo;settlers cars were burned . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; When these Arabic language media use the term & ldquo;settlers&rdquo ; they refer to all Jews who live in Israel . Every Jewish town and every Jew is a & ldquo;settler . & rdquo ; It is why the media in Lebanon and around the region that are linked to Iran and Hezbollah and other pro-Palestinian media referred to the Orthodox Jews who died in a stampede at Meron as & ldquo;settlers . & rdquo ; The same media refer to Arabs who live in Israel and are citizens of Israel as & ldquo;48 Arabs , & rdquo ; the insinuation being that nothing has changed since 1948 . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; These accounts of the conflict are linked to the far-left in the US who also portray the evictions in Sheikh Jarrah as a way for Israel to make Jerusalem a & ldquo;Jewish city . & rdquo ; Jerusalem has actually had a majority Jewish population since the mid-19th century and the area in Sheikh Jarrah that is disputed was historically Jewish . But for those who see every Jew as a & ldquo;settler&rdquo ; there is no history of Jews in Jerusalem . It is only an & ldquo;Arab city . & rdquo ; The fact that most of the first neighborhoods outside the city were Jewish is lost in that narrative . There are no historic Jews in Hebron , Tiberias , Safed , Jaffa , or anywhere . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; For more on rocket attacks against Israel&nbsp;read here For more on Israeli strikes on Gaza&nbsp;read here For more on live rocket attack updates&nbsp;read here For more on riots in Israel&nbsp;read here For more on world reactions to Gaza violence&nbsp;read here & nbsp ; This & ldquo;one state&rdquo ; narrative which supports Israel being part of a larger greater Palestinian state that includes Gaza and the West Bank has received a boost by the riots and clashes in Israel . This is because essentially the narrative of the whole area being & ldquo;one&rdquo ; territory , rather than several different territories is part of several entwined agendas . The Iranian agenda is to destroy Israel . The pro-Palestinian agenda has never stopped seeing all of Israel , the West Bank and Gaza as & ldquo;Palestine , & rdquo ; a fact made clear by the maps used in the propaganda . At the same time human rights groups have also increasingly begun to refer to the whole area as & ldquo;apartheid , & rdquo ; arguing that Israel&rsquo;s control of Gaza , the West Bank and areas inside the Green Line are all part of the same policy . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The clashes across Israel that have affected Lod , Ramla , Acre , Nazareth , Haifa , Umm al-Fahm , Rahat , Jerusalem , Jaffa and other towns and cities are an indication that a powder keg exists , and it is being enflamed by interests and agendas that would like to connect the rocket fire from Gaza , to the clashes at Al-Aqsa , to a wider struggle . It is not a small matter that the demonstrators in Jerusalem and , according to video also in Umm Al-Fahm , celebrated the rocket fire from Gaza . A dangerous development that some have linked to the clashes in 2000 during the emergence of the Second Intifada and even drawn parallels back to 1991 when Saddam Hussein fired rockets at Israel and some in Israel , under rocket fire , celebrated . For those who propose that the country could be & ldquo;one state&rdquo ; or a & ldquo;binational state , & rdquo ; these riots and clashes are a taste of what that state could be like . For Iran and Hamas this is a positive development , seeing riots and battles across Israel . It is fulfilling a kind of prophecy for them . For others who prefer stability and peace , it looks like a nightmare . & nbsp ; & nbsp ;",the riots across israel fuel arab media @ @ @ one state @ @ @ solution supporters - analysis

2022-08-22 19:25:17.143,jpost,"A group of 40 West Bank Palestinian civilians made history on Monday when they flew to Cyprus from Ramon Airport near Eilat , which they had been banned from using until now.Physicians and pharmacists and their families from Bethlehem and Hebron were among members of a group who were allowed to board a regularly scheduled Arkia flight to Larnaca . & ldquo;Until today , flights for Palestinians in a unique framework , and in particular from Ramon Airport , were just a dream , & rdquo ; Arkia Israeli Airlines CEO Oz Berlowitz said . & ldquo;And indeed , the dream has been fulfilled . & rdquo ; "" The dream has been fulfilled . "" Arkia CEO Oz BerlowitzMost Palestinians who go abroad fly out of Amman , entering Jordan via the Allenby Bridge crossing.So can Palestinians go to Ben-Gurion Airport ? & nbsp;Some 10,000 Palestinians , including senior PA officials who hold Israeli-issued VIP cards , have been permitted to travel through Ben-Gurion Airport.Amir Assi , a strategic consultant for Arkia who helped organize the trip , said West Bank Palestinians currently can access Ramon Airport only through special group options , such as this one . The airport is not open to individual West Bank Palestinians.The Airport Authority had initially planned a pilot program of two weekly flights to Turkey for West Bank Palestinians , one through Antalya and another through Istanbul . The plan would have been executed through two Turkish airline companies , but there were difficulties organizing flight times and available aircrafts . On Sunday , the Airport Authority said the plan had been delayed.Who is against the decision ? & nbsp;The Palestinian Authority on Monday renewed its call for Palestinians not to use Ramon Airport.The owners of travel and tourist agencies in Jordan have protested the Israeli decision to open Ramon Airport to Palestinian passengers , arguing that it would cause huge financial damage to their companies and the Jordanian economy.The opening of Ramon Airport to Palestinian passengers drew mixed feelings from Palestinians . Some expressed support for the move , saying it would facilitate their travel abroad , while others dismissed the idea for political reasons , dubbing it an act of & ldquo;normalization&rdquo ; with Israel . & ldquo;We have already stated and appealed to the residents not to use the [ Ramon ] airport because this is an Israeli interest , and it&rsquo;s harmful to Palestinian sovereignty , & rdquo ; PA Transportation Ministry spokesman Musa Rahhal was quoted as saying by the Palestinian Al-Watan Voice media outlet .

In 2001 , Israel bombed the radar station and control tower .

2024-05-10 18:22:39.880,jpost,"As swiftly as a hurricane , Israel&rsquo;s Eurovision contestant , Eden Golan , shot up the betting tables from eighth place to the number two spot following her performance in the second semi-final at the 68th Eurovision Song Contest in Malmo , Sweden on Thursday night , in which she secured a place in the Grand Final , which will take place on Saturday.Although there were protests outside the arena and the 20-year-old Golan was booed by as she sang & ldquo;Hurricane , & rdquo ; she also received thunderous applause , winning hearts around the world with her grace under pressure . Voters around the world enjoyed her performance enough to put her into the finals . The results of each country&rsquo;s vote is meant to be secret , but RAI , the Italian broadcaster , briefly showed the detailed breakdown on screen which revealed that Golan had won 39.3 % of its country&rsquo;s votes.RAI has since said that the results it released were "" incomplete . "" And here is a graphic of the televoting odds , showing Israel in first place : https : / / eurovisionworld.com/odds/eurovision-teleWhether she will do as well in the Grand Final , in which the results will be determined by national juries from the participating countries as well as by fans from around the world , remains to be seen . Israel is now predicted to win the televote , with the oddsmakers giving Golan a 43 % chance of a televote win . But she is predicted to come in fifth in the jury vote , which will mean that she will ultimately finish second to the favorite , Croatia's Baby Lasagna with the high-energy song , "" Rim Tim Tagi Dim . "" & nbsp;But her performance Thursday and the resulting score were a triumph for Golan and for Israel . Each shout from the crowd seemed only to enhance the preternaturally poised Golan&rsquo;s performance , as she hit every note and dance move perfectly.Far more experienced performers might have cracked under the kind of pressure and distractions that Golan faced , but she tuned them out and did her best work to date . "" I didn't hear the boos , "" she said in a press conference following the semi-final . "" I was completely focused . I felt no apprehension and no fear . "" Sometimes a song is just a song and Eurovision is just a fun song contest that Israel tends to do well in , which it has won four times in the past.But not this year.Israel's journey through Eurovision conflictAt first , it wasn&rsquo;t even clear that Israel would send a contestant because of the war that started following the Hamas massacre in Israel on October 7 . It was decided that the best choice would be to participate , but to use the song and the platform to acknowledge the tragedy.The shadow of the war hovered over the Next Star for Eurovision contest , as Shaul Greenglick , who appeared in early December , was killed in the fighting in the Gaza Strip . Greenglick , 26 , from Ra&rsquo;anana , an officer in the Nahal Brigade&rsquo;s 931st Battalion , wore his uniform to perform and sang the song & ldquo;Blind Bat&rdquo ; by Hanan Ben Ari . The judges were enthusiastic about his performance , and he would have advanced to the next round.Golan , a polished and experienced performer , who was a child star in Russia , where she spent much of her childhood due to her father&rsquo;s work , won the contest and Israeli Eurovision fans rejoiced . But even while Israelis were pleased with Golan , there were difficulties over the first song chosen by Israel , & ldquo;October Rain , & rdquo ; because it contained references to the massacre , which the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) , sponsors of the contest , found too overtly political . It was eventually replaced by & ldquo;Hurricane , & rdquo ; which contains softer lyrics , but still seems to refer to recent events.The music video released with the song seemed to show Golan and dancers in a field like where the Supernova Music Festival , where almost 400 concertgoers and staff were killed on October 7 and another 400 were kidnapped , took place.The song by Avi Ohayon , Keren Peles , and Stav Berger , contains these lyrics in English , & ldquo;Every day , I'm losin ' my mind . . . Dancin&rsquo ; in the storm/I got nothing to hide/Take it all and leave the world behind/Baby promise me you&rsquo;ll hold me again/I&rsquo;m still broken from this hurricane , & rdquo ; with additional lyrics in Hebrew : & ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need big words , just prayers/Even if it&rsquo;s hard to see/You always leave me one little light . & rdquo;The costumes are sand-colored strips of cloth , very different from the usual body-baring , flashy Eurovision look , and were designed by Alon Livne and styled by Itay Bezaleli , that look like torn clothes or bandages and the dancers moved in a loose-limbed but focused way that was reminiscent of Batsheva choreographer Ohad Naharin&rsquo;s Gaga technique.It isn&rsquo;t a stretch to see the song as the words of a young woman who has lost the love of her life in the massacre looking back and honoring his memory.But it wasn&rsquo;t only Israel&rsquo;s song choice that raised the stakes this year . Thousands of artists , mainly from Ireland and Scandinavia , called for Israel to be banned and for artists to boycott the event , although none did.Malmo has a large Muslim population much of which , according to media reports , are particularly hostile to Israel . The Israeli government issued travel warnings for Israelis attending to the event and the head of the Shin Bet security agency , Ronen Bar , went to Malmo to personally supervise Golan&rsquo;s security . Golan and her entourage were advised to stay in their hotel rooms at all times when not performing.On Thursday , protesters including climate activist Greta Thunberg demonstrated near the arena , accusing Israel of committing genocide and being an apartheid state . Not many people outside Sweden know that Thunberg&rsquo;s mother , Malena Ernman , is a professional singer who represented Sweden in Eurovision in 2009 , finishing in 21st place.That was the year that Israel sent Noa and Mira Awad , a Jew and a Christian Arab , to compete . The duo finished in 16th place with their song , & ldquo;There Must Be Another Way , & rdquo ; which celebrates coexistence , although if her mother ever told her about that , Thunberg seemed to have forgotten on Thursday.Golan and the Israeli delegation had security like a head of state , with a motorcade comprised of dozens of cars accompanying her from her hotel to the venue . But Golan said in numerous interviews that she had felt only & ldquo;good vibes&rdquo ; from her fellow contestants , although there were signs that not everyone was so accepting of her presence.During a press conference after she advanced to the final , a Polish journalist asked Golan , & ldquo;Have you ever thought that by being here , you bring risk and danger for other participants ? & rdquo ; Told she didn't have to answer the question , Golan responded , nonetheless , & ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re all here for one reason , and one reason only . And the EBU is taking all safety precautions to make this a safe and united place for everyone , so I think it&rsquo;s safe for everyone . & rdquo;Rylan Clark , one of the BBC hosts of Eurovision coverage , has been doing interviews with contestants that he posts on TikTok , but he didn&rsquo;t interview Golan in person , which won him praise from some , while others pointed out he did not personally interview every performer.Belgium's representative , Mustii , had the word "" peace "" written on his arm during his performance at the semi-final . The Flemish Broadcasting Authority in Belgium opened the Eurovision broadcast on Thursday night with a protest slide against Israel that said , "" We condemn Israel's violation of human rights , which also harms the freedom of the press . Ceasefire now . "" The Finnish singer , Kaarija , who represented his country last year with the catchy , & ldquo;Cha Cha Cha , & rdquo ; danced with Golan backstage as cameras rolled . The video was posted to social media by KAN , which sponsors and broadcasts Eurovision in Israel , and other places , but he later posted a disclaimer to Instagram that said , "" I happened to meet Israel's Eurovision representative today , and a video was filmed of us . It was then posted on social media without my permission . Despite my requests for its removal , it has not been taken down . I would like to clarify and emphasize that the video is not a political statement or an endorsement of any kind . "" Swedish singer Eric Saade performed in the opening of the first semi final with a keffiya wrapped around his hand , although political symbols are banned . A spokeswoman for the EBU said : "" The Eurovision Song Contest is a live TV show . All performers are made aware of the rules of the contest , and we regret that Eric Saade chose to compromise the non-political nature of the event . "" The EBU did not post footage of Saade to its social media accounts . Ireland&rsquo;s Bambie Thug , who qualified for the final on Tuesday night , was required by the producers to remove pro-Palestinian messages from their costume when they performed.Others showed their displeasure over the participation of Israel in different ways . A Eurovision song contest viewing party at New York City's 3 Dollar Bill bar was canceled on Thursday after Golan advanced to the final . The "" Queer-owned and operated Nightclub "" apologized for scheduling the event and said that hosting the party did not align with their values . "" We understand the concerns raised by our community regarding the need for boycott , "" said the bar , adding the hashtag "" never again for anyone . "" The organizers of Eurovision Party London , one of that city&rsquo;s largest and most popular watch parties , cancelled its event two months ago , citing Israel&rsquo;s participation in Eurovision as the reason for the cancellation , and a number of other British venues followed suit . In Berlin , some bars cancelled their watch parties or turned them into events to support Palestinians in Gaza , but most of the parties are planned to go on as usual.One unabashed fan of Golan was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who wished her well in a video message before her performance on Thursday night . In his statement , Netanyahu said , "" Eden , I want to wish you success , but you have already succeeded . You not only face Eurovision in a proud and impressive way , but you successfully face a wave of antisemitism while standing and representing the State of Israel with respect . "" In any case , Golan will not be the only Israeli performing in the final : Jerusalem-born Tali Golergant , who is representing Luxembourg , won a place after she performed her song , & ldquo;Fighter , & rdquo ; in the first semi-final on Tuesday night . An Israeli who has lived all over the world , she has been a professional singer for seven years already , even though she is only 23.Some survivors of the massacre at the Supernova Music Festival have used the phrase , & ldquo;We will dance again , & rdquo ; to express hope for the future , and Golan showed us on Thursday night that we will sing again , too.The Jerusalem Post staff contributed to this report .",we will sing again : eden golan triumphs in eurovision semi-final

The indictment noted that several police were injured during the riot , including one officer who suffered burns and damage to his hearing . & nbsp;Previous actions of the serial riotersEarlier in the year , Sharshir had taken part in a January riot in Beit Hanina . Rioters threw trash cans , rocks , fireworks and even threw Molotov cocktails at security personnel . The suspect gave fireworks to other rioters.In October 2022 , Sharshir and others joined riots in which they pelted a bus traveling from Neve Yaakov past Beit Hanina with rocks . Later , when identifying another car with occupants that were visibly Jewish , they pelted a private car with rocks . & nbsp;Later that night , Sharshir joined riots in Isawiya in which he threw more rocks and fireworks at police officers.The serial rioter had previously taken part in riots at the Temple Mount in April 2022 , along with Bukhari . Early that month , rioters collected weapons with the plan to throw objects at Jews and police.The two 20-year-old men threw fireworks , causing a fire to break out in a nearby grove , requiring firefighters to arrive . & nbsp;Sharshir faces six separate charges and Bukhari two . The indictment included the crime of rioting , assaulting police officers , assault causing injury , reckless use of fire , throwing rocks at vehicles and possession of banned substances , among others .",jerusalem serial rioter who opened snapchat group for riots indicted

2020-12-31 18:38:35.657,jpost,"Two of Israel&rsquo;s top international law officials have published a rare public article to challenge the International Criminal Court prosecution and others who say that Israel still illegally occupies Gaza . The article , published in the journal Iyunei Mishpat ( Legal Studies ) recently but being reported now for the first time in English , is important both regarding addressing cases of alleged Israeli war crimes in ongoing fighting with Hamas , as well as regarding what humanitarian obligations Jerusalem has to Gaza , during coronavirus and other periods . These issues ultimately have major long-term implications at the national security and diplomatic levels , including whether Israel&rsquo;s naval blockade and other periodic closures of Gaza are legal . Just as important are the authors : Deputy Attorney-General ( International Law ) Roy Schondorf and IDF International Law Division chief Col . Eran Shamir-Borer , two officials who have led much of Israel&rsquo;s handling of ICC issues and humanitarian dilemmas with Gaza . Schondorf rarely writes publicly or appears in public with the exception of specific conferences or at the Knesset , and Shamir-Borer appears even less often . It seems that the impetus for their article was to address prior statements by ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda as well as a current article by prominent Israeli prof . Eyal Gross in the same journal , declaring that Israel still legally occupies Gaza , despite having withdrawn in 2005 . If Bensouda , Gross and a number of Israeli critics in UN and international bodies are correct that Israel occupies Gaza , it could mean that the Jewish state might be restricted in what categories of force it could use to combat Hamas attacks , let alone protests or riots on the border . Further , it could mean that any humanitarian crisis in Gaza puts Israel at fault . When there are debates about Israeli blockades to prevent rockets and other weapons smuggling , these legal questions could have a decisive impact . Essentially , Bensouda , Gross and much of the international community say that it is irrelevant that the IDF withdrew and that Israel withdrew its settlements from within the Gaza Strip . Rather , they argue that UN General Assembly decisions , International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) guidance , a decision by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) and other points prove that Israel can & ldquo;occupy&rdquo ; Gaza as long as it exerts functional control . To support their argument , they note that Israel controls Gaza&rsquo;s airspace , maritime borders , wherever there is a blockade , and most of its land borders . Gaza does have one border crossing with Egypt . They broaden these arguments by saying that Israel&rsquo;s ability to control Gaza&rsquo;s interactions with the outside world means it can also control the economic and humanitarian situation there . In this light , they say that Israel is also obligated to maintain Gaza from a humanitarian perspective , whether with special needs during coronavirus times or with sufficient medical , food , utilities and other items during more normal periods . IN CONTRAST , Schondorf and Shamir-Bohrer say that there is no basis to rely on the decisions of the UN General Assembly or other political bodies to decide international law . Regarding the ICTY decision , they say that critics&rsquo ; understanding of the decisions is misplaced . In the ICTY case in question , the court was dealing with a situation where a foreign state controlled an internal group within another state in order to impose its will on the other state . In any event , the Israeli officials&rsquo ; article says that the ICTY decision was an outlier creating a new doctrine which no one else has adopted . Moreover , the article says that the ideas Israeli critics are bringing to the Gaza question are & ldquo;wishful thinking&rdquo ; or & ldquo;aspirations&rdquo ; to create a new law which does not exist . Instead , they say that to be considered an & ldquo;occupier , & rdquo ; a country cannot merely have aspects of functional power over a territory . Rather , it must have at a minimum & ldquo;effective control . & rdquo ; This traditionally has required boots on the ground and , at the very least , involvement in running the day-to-day affairs of the foreign territory and population . As the article says , Israel has zero involvement in running Gaza&rsquo;s day-to-day affairs , which are run by Hamas . Further , the article cites a legal brief filed by Germany in the Israel-Palestinian proceedings before the ICC to support its views . All of this means that Israel has not occupied Gaza since 2005 . Rather , when Israel facilitates food , economic and medical aid to Gaza , it is on a voluntary humanitarian basis and balanced along with valid security considerations , says the article . In December 2019 , Bensouda requested that the ICC Pretrial Chamber endorse by March her desire to conduct a full criminal probe of Israel and Hamas regarding the 2014 Gaza War , the 2018 Gaza border crisis and the settlement enterprise . The chamber has still not decided the issue , with the question remaining whether it will decide after US President-elect Joe Biden takes office or wait for Bensouda&rsquo;s successor to take over in June 2021 .",israel’s 2 top int’l law officials take on icc : is gaza ‘ occupied ’ ?
2024-03-10 14:37:28.383,jpost,"Women have been present in the Israeli art scene from its beginnings & ndash ; artists such as Aviva Uri , Esther Peretz Arad , Anna Ticho , Leah Nikel , and Ruth Shlos . Their role in building the art world in Israel seems to me as significant as the impact of female pioneers ( halutzot ) in creating the State of Israel , the role of the first female prime minister , Golda Meir , and ( up to the present day ) the importance of female soldiers serving in the IDF.However , even though the role of women has been so crucial in Israel , and the feminist art movement was not as strong as in other countries , it took female artists decades to be equally represented by galleries and museums.Ruth Markus is a retired lecturer in Tel Aviv University&rsquo;s History of Art Department and founder of the Association for Women&rsquo;s Art and Gender Research in Israel . In her article & ldquo;Artists : Yishuv and Israel : 1920-1970&rdquo ; in the Shalvi/Hyman Encyclopedia of Jewish Women , she says that it is only since the 1990s that & ldquo;the number of participants in exhibitions in the various museums and galleries was divided equally between men and women , with the women at times even in the majority . & rdquo;Today , I even dare to say that women dominate Israeli art . Therefore , especially on International Women&rsquo;s Day , I&rsquo;ve chosen for the Magazine three women artists who , even during the war , are constantly active . They agreed to answer my three questions:What inspires you?What do you call art?What , in your opinion , makes your artwork different from that of other artists?Batia ShaniBatia Shani is a multimedia artist , emphasizing embroidery , mail art , painting , and collage . She is the mother of three and grandmother of six.She uses materials and clothes previously used , including IDF uniforms . Shani embroiders texts , images , numbers , and amorphic shapes . Each of the garments holds images and words ; for example , the names and ages of women murdered by their partners . Her art deals with social issues , violence against women and families , people in crisis , refugees , and recently , the painful silence toward the sexual victims of the Oct . 7 massacre . In her latest works , it is embroidered : & ldquo;Me too . Unless you&rsquo;re a Jew . & rdquo;Born and raised in Haifa to a family of Holocaust survivors who came to Israel just after WW II , Shani was expected to get an education and start a & ldquo;normal job . & rdquo ; So , before becoming an artist , she worked as a social worker . Art was always present in her life , but it was only in her mid-thirties that she decided to focus completely on art , studying at the Royal School of Needlework in London , and later in Israel at the Hamidrasha School of Art , Beit Berl College , Kalmania . & ldquo;The studies helped me understand that embroidery was my language , & rdquo ; she said . Embroidery as a craft was deeply rooted in her family traditions . When she was a girl , she watched her aunts embroidering . She changed it into art.Since the 1990s , Shani has exhibited her work at many art fairs , galleries , and museums around the world . Now she is preparing two solo exhibitions . & ldquo;I Speak Gibberish to You&rdquo ; is set to open on May 9 in her studio at 6 Hapelech Street in Tel Aviv . A show at the University of Haifa ( name not yet revealed ) will open on June 2.INSPIRATION : Everything . In general , my work is improvised ; I don&rsquo;t have any plan when I start my journey with my needle [ there is a dress full of stories that she worked on for a year ] . My inspiration comes from the piece of fabric that I started to work with , but it must be material with some history . In many of my works , I want to preserve the memory of my late mother.I am inspired by my emotions and by what I see around me . For example , in my upcoming exhibition , I will reflect on the situation in Israel . I felt a lack of words to express what was happening in Israel [ last year ] , so I used embroidery as & lsquo;gibberish&rsquo ; language . I thought it was the worst moment in my country : I didn&rsquo;t realize it could get much worse . . . MEANING OF ART : For me , as a viewer & ndash ; because I love seeing art by others & ndash ; it is something that touches me . Of course , it comes through the doors of visuality , but [ it has to be ] something that will play on my emotional threads.SHANI&rsquo;S ARTWORK : First of all , I refuse to look for something unique , something that is only mine . But , of course , it makes me very happy when someone recognizes my embroidery and envelopes & ndash ; which are also characteristics in my work ; these are my fingerprints.I think maybe the amount of sensitivity to the details , maybe my ability to express sad and painful things is what makes my works different . I am a feminist artist , so I show things that cause the discrimination of women . I try not to put , as a headline , that my work is politically involved , but I have a lot to say about politics . I am dealing with catastrophes , with grief . The current war . . . The outcome is very aesthetic , often very colorful , but when people come closer to it , they notice the text that I embroidered , which is very hard.batiashani.com/Noa YekutieliAt a young age , Noa Yekutieli is already an internationally accomplished artist . For over a decade she has had various solo shows and participated in group exhibitions all over the world . Her works are in the collections of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem , the Tel Aviv Museum of Art , and various private collections . She lives and works in Tel Aviv , Los Angeles , and New York . Her solo exhibition & ldquo;No Longer & ndash ; Not Yet&rdquo ; is currently on view at Brooklyn&rsquo;s International Studio & amp ; Curatorial Program ( ISCP ) through June 21 . In April , she will participate in a group exhibition & ldquo;Common Ground : Israeli Art Meets Archaeology&rdquo ; at the Israel Museum.Yekutieli comes from a multicultural family ( Japanese-American-Israeli ) and uses her rich heritage in her works . She combines a diversity of materials that , she says , & ldquo;echo longing for unknown singular origins and fractured notions of home . & rdquo ; She engages in various mediums , such as installation , assemblage , and her signature manual paper-cutting technique , about which , she said , & ldquo;It mirrors my artistic essence . It embodies the Japanese concept of & lsquo;Ma&rsquo ; & ndash ; emphasizing the significance of missing or what is missed . I am drawn to the unseen , reflecting overlooked narratives and the complexities of cultural assimilation . The act of its irreversibility reduction mirrors life , leaving scars that prompt reflection . & rdquo;INSPIRATION : As a multicultural artist of Japanese-American-Israeli background , I naturally seek to bridge between cultures and languages in my work . I am inspired to explore new languages or forms of expression to address traumatic and complex subjects such as the social-political reality in Israel-Palestine , immigration , and cyclic patterns of destruction . & nbsp;Through the medium of manual cut paper , I am compelled to create spaces and artworks imbued with a deliberately contrasting aesthetic . I attempt to offer an alternative language & ndash ; one that is more vulnerable , feminine , and nuanced & ndash ; in observing and reflecting on the harsh realities we confront . This counters the rapid pace and predominantly Western , masculine discourse that often created this reality , to begin with , and is perpetuating the continuous destructive patterns . I am inspired to create spaces that can hold more than one narrative , more than one absolute truth & ndash ; to question how we tell stories rather than telling a story.MEANING OF ART : To me , art encompasses any endeavor that challenges what we often accept as & lsquo;the nature of things&rsquo ; or & lsquo;established perspectives . & rsquo ; It&rsquo;s not about resistance for its own sake but rather about suggesting and providing fresh viewpoints to comprehend the reality surrounding us . Art acts as a bubble within which I can uniquely unfold the intricacies of reality , and then reconnect with the broader world through my art again . It serves as a meditative space where my unconscious takes over , leading me to different ways of thinking about the given.YEKUTIELI&rsquo;S ARTWORK : In my perspective , what sets my artwork apart is that I am not afraid of embracing liminal spaces . Often , there&rsquo;s a reluctance to engage with these spaces of in-betweenness : those that are almost , not here nor there , or unclear , even though they constitute much of our lived experience . In my practice , I am deeply intrigued by the notion of crafting environments where we collectively explore liminality , viewing it not as a mere interim state awaiting conclusions but as a novel and fertile terrain in its own right . & nbsp;Coming from a multicultural background devoid of a historically shared past & ndash ; being both Japanese and Israeli & ndash ; I find myself naturally attuned to multiplicity without experiencing discomfort . In a world marked by polarization , I see the creation of spaces , where multiplicity enriches rather than confuses , as a crucial aspect of the human experience.www.noayekutieli.com/Ella TaubA self-taught artist , Ella Taub & ndash ; in her sculptures , paintings , relief works , prints , and drawings & ndash ; focuses on the nature of changes in a feminine body , also oscillating between historically appreciated shapes and contemporary beauty images . Taub explores different female roles in her art and the evolution of self-image.Taub works with different materials , sometimes including body-like ones , and metal chains . & ldquo;I collect materials for my work from my surroundings ; each of my works is connected to the place and time in which I create . Often , a material from which the sculpture emerges gives the work&rsquo;s narrative , & rdquo ; she told the Magazine.Some of her works are very personal and based on intimate relations with herself and others . In her recent February solo show in Tel Aviv & ldquo;What I Didn&rsquo;t Wear , & rdquo ; Taub refers to her close connection with her mother ( with whom , at age five , she made aliyah from St . Petersburg , Russia ) but also enters into a dialogue with her future daughters , whom she might have one day.Taub has exhibited in Israel and Berlin . Her works are on view until March 9 at the group show & ldquo;Bread and Roses 18&rdquo ; at the Bread and Roses Gallery in Tel Aviv.INSPIRATION : My artistic journey is fueled by the intricate dance of relationships & ndash ; those between my inner self , my corporeal form , and the world around me . The allure lies in exploring the ever-shifting nuances of the feminine physique , its narrative etched by life&rsquo;s twists and turns , and its resonance across diverse cultural landscapes . Moreover , personal narratives , like the potent symbolism of freedom evoked by chains in select pieces , serve as potent wellsprings of inspiration . My art serves as a mirror reflecting the interplay of inner dialogue , societal constructs , and the relentless quest for liberation.MEANING OF ART : Art , to me , is a boundless realm where creativity intertwines with introspection . It manifests in myriad forms . Art is not merely about aesthetics ; it&rsquo;s a profound exploration of complex themes , a challenge to established norms , and a conduit for stirring the soul . It&rsquo;s a process that transcends boundaries , beckoning viewers into a realm of dialogue , reflection , and interpretation.TAUB&rsquo;S ARTWORK : My artistic voice resonates distinctly through its intimate exploration of the feminine form and its intricate relationship with the self-image perception and body expression society . Through solitary figures and intricate symbolism , I aim to evoke themes of independence , resilience , and the societal gaze upon women & ndash ; and question historical patriarchal myths by infusion of personal narratives , and materials , that are collected with a connection to the space and time . Ultimately , my art distinguishes itself through its poignant exploration of the human experience , beckoning viewers into a silent dialogue.ellataub.com / ","three women artists , three questions"
2024-05-01 18:25:55.633,jpost,"The world&rsquo;s climate is changing & ndash ; again . But instead of getting warmer the last time like it is now , in around 6,200 BCE , it was getting colder.A drought resulted and launched what was called the 8.2ka ( kiloyears & ndash ; thousands of years & ndash ; ago ) , which began about 8,200 years ago and lasted for the next two to four centuries in the southern Levant that includes modern-day Israel , the Palestinian territories , Jordan , Lebanon , southern Syria and the Sinai desert.Until now , archaeologists thought that this sudden cooling in global climate led to the widespread abandonment of coastal settlements in the southern Levant . However , researchers at the University of Haifa , Bar-Ilan University ( BIU ) in Ramat Gan , and the University of California at San Diego have produced new evidence suggesting that at least one village formerly thought abandoned not only remained occupied but thrived throughout this period . They said the study helped fill a gap in our understanding of the early settlement of the Eastern Mediterranean coastline.They have just published their study in the journal Antiquity under the title & ldquo;Continuity and climate change : the Neolithic coastal settlement of Habonim North , Israel . & rdquo;The village of Habonim North was discovered off the Carmel Coast in the mid-2010s and later surveyed by a team led by the University of Haifa&rsquo;s Dr . Ehud Arkin Shalev . The study was led by Prof . Assaf Yasur-Landau , head of the Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at the University of Haifa , and Roey Nickelsberg , a doctoral candidate there . BIU Prof . Ehud Weiss and Dr . Suembikya Frumin also participated . & ldquo;This study helped fill a gap in our understanding of the early settlement of the Eastern Mediterranean coastline , & rdquo ; said Prof . Thomas Levy , a co-author on the paper , co-director of UC San Diego&rsquo;s Center for Cyber-Archaeology and Sustainability ( CCAS ) and chairman of Archaeology of Ancient Israel and Neighboring Lands in the anthropology department of the university&rsquo;s graduate division.Unearthing the Levantine coastline&ldquo;It deals with human resilience , & rdquo ; he said . An experienced scuba diver , Levy spent 40 years carrying out archaeological field work in the deserts of Israel and Jordan.Before its excavation and analysis , there was little evidence for human habitation along the southern Levantine coast during the 8.2ka event . The dig , which involved a weeks-long , 24/7 coordinated effort between the partners in the two countries , was the first formal excavation of the submerged site.Animal bonesLED BY Yasur-Landau and Nickelsberg , the international team excavated the site using a combination of sediment dredging and sampling , as well as photogrammetry and 3D modeling . Team members uncovered pottery shards or & ldquo;sherds&rdquo ; ; stone tools , including ceremonial weapons and fishing-net weights ; animal and plant remains ; and architecture.Using radiocarbon dating , the researchers tested the recovered bones of wild and domesticated animals , the charred seeds of wild plants , crops like wheat and lentils , and weeds that tend to accompany these crops . Their results traced these organic materials back to the Early Pottery Neolithic ( EPN ) , which coincided with both the invention of pottery and the 8.2ka event.Pottery sherds , stone tools and architecture in the village were also evidence of activity at the site to the EPN and , surprisingly , to the Late Pottery Neolithic , when the village was thought to have been abandoned.As for how the village likely weathered the worst of the climate instability , the researchers point to signs of an economy that diversified from farming to include maritime culture and trade within a distinct cultural identity . Evidence includes fishing-net weights ; tools made of basalt , a stone that does not naturally occur along this part of the eastern Mediterranean coast ; and a ceremonial mace head . & ldquo;Our study showed that the Early Pottery Neolithic society displayed multi-layered resilience that enabled it to withstand the 8.2ka crisis , & rdquo ; noted Yasur-Landau , a senior author on the paper . & ldquo;I was happily surprised by the richness of the finds , from pottery to organic remains . & rdquo;Although scientists debate the cause of the 8.2ka event , some speculate that it began with the final collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet , which shaped much of the North American landscape in its retreat from modern-day Canada and the northern US . As it melted , the ice sheet would have changed the flow of ocean currents and affected heat transport , leading to the observed drop in global temperatures.Many of the activities uncovered at the village , including the creation of culturally distinct pottery and trade , formed the basis for later urban societies . & ldquo;To me , what&rsquo;s important is to change how we look at things , & rdquo ; said Nickelsberg . & ldquo;Many archaeologists like to look at the collapse of civilizations . Maybe it&rsquo;s time to start looking at the development of human culture , rather than its destruction and abandonment .",joint us-israeli underwater excavations reveal ancient human resilience despite climate change
2021-09-17 13:20:27.683,jpost,"September 17 , 2021 marks 43 years since the signing of the Camp David Accords between former Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat , under the auspices of then US president Jimmy Carter . It paved the way for the 1979 Israeli-Egyptian peace deal , the first such treaty between Israel and one of its Arab neighbors . The Camp David Accords was the culmination of considerable political machinations and came just years after the conclusion of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 , widely regarded as Israel's darkest hour and where Egypt played a major role as the aggressor . The war was devastating , with the Jewish state flanked in a surprise attack by Egypt and Syria . Though Israel achieved a military victory over its adversaries and came within shelling range of Damascus , the war shocked the Jewish state out of complacency , prompting the resignation of Israel's prime minister Golda Meir . After the war Israelis viewed the Egyptian military in a new , more dangerous light . However , Egypt had seen the conflict differently . Despite Egyptian military successes in the conflict , some in Cairo were convinced that Israel simply could not be beaten on the battlefield . As such , it seemed doubtful they could use force of arms to destroy the Jewish state . But one thing it undoubtedly achieved was to shift the region's status quo . & nbsp ; Two events then further changed everything and set the scene for the eventual peace talks . The first event was on May 17 , 1977 . This was Israel's general election and saw the right-wing Likud Party , led by Begin , achieve a historic upset with a landslide victory , giving Israel a right-wing government for the first time ever . The second event was Sadat's historic interview on CBS News with Walter Cronkite on November 14 of the same year . During this interview , Sadat shocked the world by saying that he was more than willing to actually visit Jerusalem for peace negotiations . & nbsp ; "" I want to discuss the whole situation with the 120 members of the Knesset and put the full picture and details of the situation from our point of view , "" he said at the time . & nbsp ; This was not the first time Sadat expressed willingness to go to Israel , and he had said as much in a speech before the People's Assembly just five days earlier . However , now his intentions were made public to the world . That same day , Cronkite interviewed Begin and asked for his response . & ldquo;I can assure you , Mr . Cronkite , as we really want the visit of president Sadat , we really want to negotiate the peace , to establish permanent peace in the Middle East , & rdquo ; Begin said . & ldquo;Any time , any day he's prepared to come , I will receive him cordially at the airport , and go together with him to Jerusalem , also present him to the Knesset and let him make his speech to our parliament . I will follow him onto the platform and greet him , receive him . & rdquo ; Shortly after , this exact situation happened . Sadat , in an unprecedented and historic moment , arrived at Lod Airport ( known today as Ben-Gurion Airport ) . On November 20 , Sadat then made history by addressing the Knesset . & nbsp ; Sadat's move threw out the rulebook , taking Washington by surprise . It led to negotiations that culminated in the Camp David Accords , which were signed at the White House by Sadat and Begin in 1978 after 12 days of secret talks at Camp David . There were two frameworks in the accords . The first dealt with the Palestinians and faced condemnation for a lack of participation from the Palestinians themselves . However , the second framework was between Egypt and Israel , winning both Begin and Sadat the Nobel Peace Prize and directly leading to the treaty being signed a year later . Notably , as part of the accords , Israel pledged to fully withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula in its entirety . Israel had taken the peninsula following the Six Day War , and Israeli settlements did exist in the area . But now they all had to be withdrawn . But ultimately , it was seen as a good thing in Israel , where it continues to enjoy support . & nbsp ; According to a 2001 poll by the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies , 85 % of Israelis support the accords . In Egypt , however , the response was less positive . The nations of the Arab world were harshly critical of Egypt's move , costing them their membership in the Arab League and causing unrest and sedition to fester , particularly among Islamist groups . Ultimately , on October 6 , 1981 , Sadat was assassinated at a victory parade by Islamists belonging to the Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization . In total , 11 people were killed at the event outright , including Sadat , an Omani delegate and the Cuban ambassador , while 28 were wounded . Sadat was ultimately succeeded by his vice president , Hosni Mubarak , who stayed in power for 30 years until the 2011 Arab Spring . Today , Egypt's relations with Israel are tense , particularly regarding the Palestinian conflict , and security remains strong at the Sinai border . However , Cairo has maintained an active role in regional affairs , particularly regarding the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip , with which it shares a border . & nbsp ; Egypt played a critical role in the restoration of calm that ended the 11-day May war between Israel and Hamas , known as Operation Guardian of the Walls . Despite this , the peace remains cold , and following 2011 , Israeli and Egyptian leaders went a decade without meeting , until Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met at Sharm e-Sheikh . Ultimately , the Camp David Accords are remembered positively as the first truly successful peace negotiation between Israel and an Arab nation . It marked Israel's first act of normalization with an Arab nation and was followed decades later by Jordan in 1994 and then 26 years later in 2020 with the Abraham Accords forging peace between Israel , Bahrain , Morocco , Sudan and the United Arab Emirates . Further , the now-iconic image of Sadat and Begin shaking hands remains a testament to the efforts of diplomacy .","on this day : camp david accords signed , leading to israel-egypt peace"

Viewers of the program would typically still be within the K-12 schooling years . Previous airings of the show have featured children within their teens participating discussions , poetry readings , etc . The presenter , in this episode , seems to be standing in front of a background displaying a rudimentary toy train , suitable for young children . & quot;Unfortunately & ndash ; and this is a very painful thing that I want to tell you about & ndash ; a number of friends have lost their right to live because the occupation is deliberately killing the Palestinian children , and this is a very painful thing , & rdquo ; said host of the program Walaa Al-Battat . The program presenter went on to explain that Israel participates in the practice of & quot;random summary executions , & quot ; claiming that Palestinian children have nowhere to run and that they are in & quot;danger at every moment . & quot ; & quot;Every one of them & ndash ; on the road or at home & ndash ; is a candidate to be the next martyr , & quot ; Al-Battat added . In 2015 , Al-Battat voiced similar rhetoric , where she went on to claim that & quot;the occupation [ Israel ] targets children everywhere , & quot ; whether it be in their homes or schools , adding that Israeli security forces act in a & quot;barbaric terrorist way . & quot ; This was voiced during a wave of stabbing attacks on Israeli citizens by Palestinian terrorists . & quot;They are trying to kill people everywhere .

2022-09-11 18:56:27.117,jpost,"With a rig set to start pumping gas from Israel&rsquo;s Karish gas field within weeks , threats by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah will likely be put to the test , as will the new head of the IDF&rsquo;s Northern Command , Maj . - Gen . Uri Gordin.According to Matthew Levitt , director of the Jeanette and Eli Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy , Hezbollah wants to & ldquo;scratch their resistance itch . & rdquo;While Hezbollah can attempt to do something , it does not want to drag the region into a full-blown war.Lebanon is in such a disastrous state that it understands the need for a maritime border deal , said Levitt , a former counter-terrorism official . But , he added , the group is also willing to put Lebanese citizens at risk and drag Israel into a war just to use it as a scapegoat.Hezbollah , Lebanon's massive terrorist armyUnder Nasrallah , Hezbollah has grown into what the IDF describes as a & ldquo;terror army&rdquo ; with an estimated 150,000 rockets and munitions that can hit anywhere in the country.It is believed that in the next war , Hezbollah will try to fire close to 4,000 rockets per day to start , followed by some 2,000 per day until the last day of the conflict.In comparison , during Operation Breaking Dawn in August , Islamic Jihad fired a total of just more than 1,000 rockets from Gaza in three days.In a recent interview with Walla , Gordin said the IDF will prioritize the northern part of the state , since 50 % of Hezbollah&rsquo;s arsenal is aimed at cities 15 km . from the border with Lebanon , including Nahariya , Acre , Safed and Kiryat Shmona.Another 40 % of Hezbollah&rsquo;s missiles can reach Haifa and surrounding areas . Only 5 % can reach targets further to the south.Hezbollah has not given up on work on its precision munition project . It is believed that the majority of the alleged Israeli airstrikes in Syria as part of its & ldquo;war between the wars&rdquo ; campaign have been targeting components for the project.The terrorist group also has sophisticated drones that can be used for reconnaissance missions or carry munitions to attack targets.Though former Israel Air Force Commander Maj . - Gen ( res . ) Amikam Norkin has said the IAF lost its aerial superiority over Lebanon , Levitt argued otherwise . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated and Israel has to take more precautions , but Israel can still go where it needs to , when it needs to , to get what it needs . & rdquo;Matthew Levitt&ldquo;It&rsquo;s complicated , and Israel has to take more precautions , but Israel can still go where it needs to , when it needs to , to get what it needs , & rdquo ; he said.The group also has significant battlefield experience after their engagement on the side of Bashar Assad during the Syrian civil war.Hezbollah&rsquo;s elite Radwan forces are a force to be feared and are spread across southern Lebanon waiting for the order to attack Israel . & ldquo;You have to take the Radwan forces seriously , & rdquo ; said Levitt.In addition to the on-the-job training and weapons ( including American-made AR-15s ) , the Radwan forces & ldquo;are disciplined , & rdquo ; Levitt noted . And while they face challenges such as the loss of senior operatives , many of the Radwan troops & ldquo;only know fighting in Syria . & rdquo;While tensions have risen significantly between Israel and Hezbollah , the intelligence community does not think that Nasrallah would drag the entire region into war over the gas rig.The extraction of the gas and the potential signing of a deal between Israel and Lebanon , mediated by the United States , also comes as the West believes there will not be a nuclear deal signed with Iran.Iran already sends $ 800 million annually to Hezbollah , and the lack of a deal would not stop the Islamic Republic from continuing to fund them . & ldquo;Iran prioritizes them , and withdrawing from the JCPOA did nothing . They can afford it , & rdquo ; said Levitt.Gordin , who took over the Northern Command from Maj . - Gen . Amir Baram on Sunday evening , knows that some sort of confrontation with Hezbollah will happen under his watch & ndash ; be it a limited round of violence like what happens with Gaza , or a full-blown devastating war between the two sides.Hezbollah took many risks under Baram&rsquo;s tenure , including firing an anti-tank missile toward an empty military ambulance in 2019 and firing 19 rockets toward empty fields last summer . The group also launched drones toward the Karish gas field in early July.None of those events led to an outbreak of war , but one miscalculation and the story could be totally different.Israel has warned that any infrastructure in Lebanon that serves Hezbollah is a military target . The military has said that it already has thousands of targets at the ready in its target bank.With Lebanon already amid an economic collapse , a war with Israel could lead the country to utter devastation.Is Nasrallah ready to risk that ?",will hezbollah ' scratch its resistance itch ' and attack israel ? - interview

It will be extremely difficult , and we will have a hard time being joyful & ndash ; because just minutes prior , we shed so many tears remembering all the brothers and sisters that we lost this year.Yet , in my prayers on Independence Day I will recall the long history of the Jewish people , and I will say thank you to God with the knowledge that unfortunately this is not the first year in the history of the Jewish nation that Jews have been killed for being Jews . This is not the first year that Jews have been forced to leave their homes , and this is not the first year that we have witnessed destruction.So , I will thank God because we will all stand together and remember that we have the Israel Defense Forces , that we have a God in Heaven who shows us that even though they attack us with hundreds of missiles , some among the most advanced in the world , the Holy One , blessed be He , protects us and gives us an air force with advanced systems , and soldiers on land and sea who love the Holy Land and are ready to give up their lives in defense of it.Praying that the Diaspora understands the need for Israel&nbsp;I will stand on Independence Day and I will pray knowing that this year , more than ever , there are so many Jews around the world who understand the need for the State of Israel . Since last year , so many more Jews living in the Diaspora have come to understand that the State of Israel is crucial for the Jewish people.I will thank God because those brothers and sisters of ours from the Diaspora , many of whom did not realize how much they were our brothers and sisters , discovered just how much they were in every way & ndash ; in real time . While we were being attacked , defiled and murdered , they did everything to assist and help us , and they had a real impact with their connections , their contributions , and their insights.I will thank God that the planes that fly to Israel are full to the brim , and that all the missions that the OU and other organizations have brought are always filled to capacity . That every single family we visited and asked to hug , stood and hugged people they didn&rsquo;t know for several minutes . We were privileged to see the Jewish people standing together and praying for the success of the State of Israel and for the complete redemption . I am thankful for the millions of chapters of Psalms recited and all of the Torah learning for Am Yisrael.I will thank God because I know that our enemies do not want us to be happy on Independence Day . I will do so knowing that they committed shocking act of terrorism to try to prevent us from having an Independence Day , and the Holy One , blessed be He , saved us from them . God gave us a strong army and a strong nation . He gave us a wondrous and brave generation of young men and women who are fighting fiercely , who have enabled us to celebrate this Independence Day.This year , I don&rsquo;t need fighter jets to do shows and fly-overs . This year , we can look within and see the bravery and heroism in the heart of each and every one of us.We should all celebrate this Independence Day to show our enemies that they will not bring us down .

2024-04-21 02:16:38.407,jpost,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the United States for its plans to issue its first-ever sanctions against IDF units over alleged human rights violations , starting with the Netzah Yehuda Battalion , which in the past has been accused of mistreating Palestinians.Among the more high-profile incidents was the death of Palestinian American Omar As&rsquo;ad , 80 , of a heart attack in January 2022 after he had been detained , blindfolded , gagged , and handcuffed by that battalion in the West Bank.Netanyahu calls for the government to act against move&ldquo;I will fight this with all my powers , & rdquo ; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Israeli public on Sunday in a video address.Minister Benny Gantz , who is a former defense minister and IDF chief of staff , spoke with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday and asked him to rescind the decision , which , he warned , & ldquo;will harm Israel&rsquo;s international legitimacy during the time of war . & rdquo;He also explained that & ldquo;the Israeli judicial system is strong and independent . All IDF units are subject to the IDF&rsquo;s code of conduct and orders in accordance with international law . & rdquo;The decision , Gantz wrote in a post on X , & ldquo;sets a dangerous precedent and conveys the wrong message to our shared enemies during wartime . & rdquo;Netanyahu wrote on X on Saturday night that the decision was & ldquo;the height of absurdity and a moral low . & rdquo ; & ldquo;In recent weeks , I have been working against the leveling of sanctions on Israeli citizens , including in my conversations with senior American government officials , & rdquo ; he stated . & ldquo;The government I head will act by all means against these moves , & rdquo ; Netanyahu stressed , adding that & ldquo;sanctions must not be imposed on the Israel Defense Forces ! & rdquo ; & nbsp;Netanyahu spoke out against such a move , first reported by Walla , just one hour after he wrote a message on X thanking the House of Representatives for passing a $ 23.2 billion military aid bill for Israel , which now moves to the Senate.Reflecting the moves of the Biden AdministrationThe two messages reflect two concurrent moves by the Biden administration . Since the Hamas invasion of Israel on October 7 , it has deepened its support of Israel while at the same time cracking down on extremist Jewish violence against Palestinians.On Friday , the US imposed sanctions on Ben-Zion Gopstein , founder and leader of the right-wing group Lehava , and two entities that raised money for Israeli men accused of settler violence.The 1997 Leahy Law prohibits the funding of foreign military units believed to be involved in human rights abuses such as extrajudicial killing , torture , and rape.On Wednesday , the investigative US-based news site ProPublica reported that Blinken had been sitting on the State Department&rsquo;s recommendation that he apply the Leahy Law to & ldquo;multiple Israeli military and police units . & rdquo;When asked about the report at a press conference in Italy on Friday , Blinken said that application of the Leahy Law was time-consuming and & ldquo;has to be done very carefully both in collecting the facts and analyzing them & ndash ; and that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;ve done . & nbsp ; & ldquo;And I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that you&rsquo;ll see results very soon . I&rsquo;ve made determinations ; you can expect to see them in the days ahead , & rdquo ; Blinken said.On Saturday night , Walla reported that the US was expected to sanction the Netzah Yehuda Battalion , largely composed of ultra-Orthodox soldiers , which for years had served in the West Bank but which was relocated to the Golan two years ago and has been deployed in Gaza in the aftermath of the October 7 attack.The IDF said it had not received any notification about pending sanctions against the unit as it underscored the heroic actions of its soldiers under fire.Labor Party leader MK Merav Michaeli said that pending sanctions should not come as a surprise since & ldquo;the US established a team to investigate the battalion&rdquo ; already two years ago . & ldquo;The political and military echelons cannot pretend they did not know about it , & rdquo ; Michaeli stated . & ldquo;Instead of wising up and dealing with the situation , we get yet another dose of denial and foot-dragging , lies and covering up the bitter reality , & rdquo ; Michaeli said.The Netzah Yehuda Battalion should have been disbanded many years ago , she said , as she charged that the battalion & ldquo;legitimizes&rdquo ; settler violence , & ldquo;kills Palestinians for no real reason , & rdquo ; and & ldquo;abuses Palestinian detainees . & rdquo;To defend the Netzah Yehuda unit as an & ldquo;integral part of the IDF casts & ldquo;a heavy shadow over the entire IDF&rdquo ; and damages its credibility , Michaeli said .",netanyahu : absurd for us to sanction idf soldiers as they fight terror

This number is 65 % for their Jewish non-haredi counterparts , according to the study.Although the gap in completing education may have many factors , both findings indicate that the skills taught by the haredi school system are not as suited for the labor force as those taught in non-haredi education tracks , said the report.Haredi school systems do not prepare students for higher-quality positionsThe finding about completing an academic degree also indicates that the haredi school system does not prepare haredi students to integrate into higher quality positions , said the report.Closing labor market gaps between ultra-Orthodox and non-ultra Orthodox men is important for the long-term growth of Israel&rsquo;s economy , and increasing core-curriculum subjects taught in the ultra-Orthodox system is one way to close the gap , the report concluded . & nbsp ;",haredi education system doesn't prepare students for workforce - study

2022-06-24 11:02:20.747,jpost,"Chronic underfunding of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency which services 5.6 million Palestinian refugees will lead to its collapse , warned UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini . & ldquo;We are in an early waning mode right now . We have to avoid a situation where UNRWA crosses the tipping point , & rdquo ; he told reporters in New York on Friday , adding that & ldquo;we have entered a danger zone . & rdquo;Lazzarini spoke one day after the UN held a pledging conference for UNRWA , which services Palestinian refugees in Syria , Lebanon , Jordan , Gaza , the West Bank and east Jerusalem.Donor countries committed to $ 160 million , which allows the agency to operate for the next few months , he explained . "" To illustrate austerity , think of 50 children in one classroom , double shifts within schools , or a medical visit where a doctor spends less than 3 minutes with a patient . "" & nbsp;Philippe Lazzarini&ldquo;We can run our operations until September , & rdquo ; Lazzarini said , adding that after that , & ldquo;I do not know if we will get the necessary cash to allow us to pay the salaries . & rdquo;Part of the problem is that & ldquo;UNRWA is expected to provide government-like services but is funded as if it was an NGO , & rdquo ; he said.The UN is set to renew its mandate this fall , as it does every three years.It&rsquo;s not enough for UN member states to vote to allow UNRWA to continue to operate , Lazzarini told the donor conference on Thursday . They must also provide the necessary funds for the agency to execute its mandate . Eventually , failure to do so would & ldquo;push the agency towards financial collapse , & rdquo ; he said , adding that he feared that day was fast approaching . & ldquo;For years , we managed the chronic underfunding through internal measures such as cost control , austerity and zero-growth budgets , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;Today , we have depleted our financial reserves and reached the limits of cost control and austerity measures , & rdquo ; he explained , adding that , & ldquo;austerity now affects the quality of the services . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We are not in a position anymore to adopt austerity and cost control measures of the size of the funding gap , & rdquo ; he said.A FUNDING failure now would put at risk the education of half a million girls and boys as well as the primary health care for close to two million people , the commissioner explained . & ldquo;To illustrate austerity , think of 50 children in one classroom , double shifts within schools , or a medical visit where a doctor spends less than three minutes with a patient . & rdquo;The pace of donations , he said , cannot keep up with the needs of a growing population.At issue , in particular , is funding for UNRWA&rsquo;s $ 817 million core needs , out of its $ 1.6 billion budget , which includes education and health care . As of mid-June , donor countries had sent the agency only $ 313 million toward that core budget . & ldquo;We need US $ 817 million & ndash ; the full US $ 817 million , & rdquo ; Lazzarini said.Not a new problem&nbsp;UNRWA has long been in financial distress , but the situation has become more acute in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian-Ukrainian war . & ldquo;The situation in Ukraine has exacerbated the noticeable increase in food and commodity prices , seriously affecting the household economy of Palestine refugees , & rdquo ; Lazzarini said.Poverty rates have reached 80 % in Lebanon , Syria and Gaza , where & ldquo;too many Palestine refugees report living with one meal a day , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;I have appealed to all donors to ensure that Palestine refugees are not a collateral of the events in Ukraine . & rdquo;DEPUTY US Ambassador to the UN Nicholas Hill told the donor conference that the Biden administration was strongly committed to UNRWA.America & ldquo;is proud to be the agency&rsquo;s largest single donor . We contributed $ 338 million to UNRWA&rsquo;s work in 2021 and have already announced $ 79 million for 2022 , & rdquo ; Hill said , adding that & ldquo;we intend to provide additional support to UNRWA this year . & rdquo;The former Trump administration had cut all US funding to UNRWA , explaining that the organization was in need of financial reform and that Palestinians could be better serviced in other ways . It had echoed concerns voiced by Israel that the agency allowed for an ever-expanding class of refugees , by providing assistance to descendants of the 750,000 Palestinians that were displaced during the 1948 War of Independence.Israel and opponents of UNRWA have also charged that there are instances of antisemitism and anti-Israel incitement in textbooks used by the agency in its classroom.On Thursday , just prior to the pledging conference , the Geneva-based NGO UN Watch released a report charging that some UNRWA teachers and staff had engaged in incitement against Jews and Israel on their social media accounts.Israel&rsquo;s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan wrote a letter to Lazzarini on Thursday , asking that he dismiss all employees who encourage terrorism and antisemitism.The commissioner-general told reporters in New York on Friday that UNRWA & ldquo;has zero tolerance when it comes to incitement to violence and discrimination . & ldquo;Whenever we are confronted with a situation where indeed there is a breach of UN values , the agency will take all the necessary measures , & rdquo ; he stressed . & ldquo;If misconduct is identified we will take measures in line with UN policies . & rdquo;He speculated that it was not a coincidence that the report , which includes some of those charges , was released on the day of the pledging conference , noting that there were those who wanted to delegitimize the agency . & ldquo;There has been an increase in activities by a number of detractors to try to delegitimize the agency and not to acknowledge all the efforts put by the agency to deal with this situation , & rdquo ; Lazzarini said .","underfunding unrwa will lead to its collapse , agency head warns"

2024-04-22 18:55:21.173,jpost,"Interior Minister Moshe Arbel of Shas is unlike many other Israeli politicians.For one thing , he doesn&rsquo;t particularly want to be a politician , and doesn&rsquo;t have higher political aspirations . If it were up to him , he would be far from the public eye , working on his doctorate in law or spending time with his family.For another , at the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7 , Arbel requested of party leader MK Arye Deri to relieve him of the dual duties of interior minister and health minister and leave him just with the former , due to the immense workload of running these two major ministries during wartime . Power and influence are currency for politicians , and who else in Israel&rsquo;s political scene today volunteers to give up a major ministry ? & ldquo;I see myself in the political arena as a reservist and not a career officer , & rdquo ; Arbel said . His use of military jargon is also rare for a haredi politician & ndash ; indeed , Arbel served in the IDF and in the reserves for years until he became a member of Knesset.He said he is & ldquo;not motivated by survivability , & rdquo ; and that it does not matter to him whether he serves another term in politics or not . As a result , he is focused not on reaping short-term achievements but & ldquo;preparing the ministry&rsquo;s foundations&rdquo ; so that , when he & ldquo;hands the keys over&rdquo ; to his successor , the ministry will be better than it is now . & ldquo;The State of Israel needs people who enter public roles with modesty and with the understanding that they have not conquered territory but are there to serve the public , & rdquo ; he said.Moshe Arbel's political , rabbinic , and IDF careerARBEL , 40 , is a father of four and lives in Petah Tikva . Public service runs in the family , as his father served on the Petah Tikva Religious Council and was a Shas activist . But Arbel himself was a full-time Torah student until his mid-twenties , and was ordained as a rabbi . He then joined the IDF Home Front Command in a unit responsible for identifying corpses ; earned bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees in law from the Ono Academic College ; served in the IDF reserves as a military prosecutor ; earned a business administration certificate from Harvard University ; and began a doctorate in law at Reichman University.Following the 2013 national election , Arbel served as a legal adviser for Shas , as a legislation adviser to then Knesset member and current Labor Minister Yoav Ben-Tzur , and as a chief of staff for Deri . In April 2023 he was appointed as both health minister and interior minister , after Deri was blocked from the positions due to previous criminal convictions.The Jerusalem Post interviewed Arbel in his Knesset office on April 8 , and the first issue to be discussed was the ongoing crisis over the haredi exemption from IDF service . As both a longtime haredi yeshiva student and a long-serving IDF reservist , Arbel&rsquo;s perspective is important.His approach can be summarized as follows : The IDF has a real need for soldiers , and haredi men who do not study Torah full-time should commit to IDF or other national service . At the same time , Torah study isn&rsquo;t just a spiritual vocation but an enterprise of national importance.Arbel called this & ldquo;the national story of a group of Torah students . . . who labor day and night over the Torah , & rdquo ; out of which will grow & ldquo;great Torah [ scholars ] with broad shoulders . & rdquo ; According to Arbel , these & ldquo;broad-shouldered&rdquo ; talents are necessary in order to uphold the tradition of & ldquo;the power of leniency , & rdquo ; a leading policy in the halachic rulings of former Sephardi chief rabbi and Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef . & ldquo;The day where we enter the debate with the deep understanding that there is a national , ethical duty to maintain these Torah students , along with the duty to maintain an economic , military , and socially prosperous state , we can create an ecosystem of understanding that does not wish to erase the identity of the other side , & rdquo ; Arbel said.This fundamental premise is more important than the details of a specific haredi conscription plan , he added.Furthermore , Arbel argued that enabling haredi men to serve in the IDF while maintaining their lifestyle is a liberal value as well & ndash ; IDF service isn&rsquo;t just a duty , it is also a right . The IDF currently does this & ldquo;sufficiently&rdquo ; and should continue doing so , he said . He stressed that yeshiva students who were not actually studying and who were & ldquo;catching a ride&rdquo ; on the blanket exemption should serve in the IDF like all other citizens.Arbel&rsquo;s approach regarding Torah study and IDF service reflects a broader view on haredi education in general . He explained that the major haredi school systems teach a core secular curriculum of some form , but that this needs to be expanded and improved . His son , for example , studied at a haredi high school yeshiva , which combined long hours of Torah study with full matriculation exams . There are many such initiatives sprouting up , and & ldquo;good things are happening&rdquo ; & ndash ; but the state needs to facilitate this & ndash ; for example , by lowering the high costs of the institutions that offer these sorts of combinations.Arbel didn&rsquo;t rule out giving haredi teens the option of studying Torah full-time . He himself studied only Torah in his teens and completed matriculation requirements later on , and the years of Torah study granted him a work ethic and analytic skills that served him later on in life . But such a system is not appropriate for everyone and should not be forced on haredi teens who aren&rsquo;t equipped for it , he argued.ARBEL&rsquo;S WORK in the Interior Ministry has garnered praise from both sides of the political divide , and the ministry was favorably mentioned for its work following the October 7 Hamas massacre.Asked about this , Arbel was quick to give credit to the ministry workers . He explained that the ministry includes three branches and described its adaptations post-October 7 in each branch . These changes led to a learning process that led to broader initiatives not just related to war.The three branches are the local authorities ; immigration and citizenship ; and urban planning and development.Following October 7 , the local authorities required receiving special powers and funding , especially those whose residents were attacked and/or evacuated . On the issue of immigration and citizenship , many of these evacuees left their homes without their passports or other identification papers , and the ministry created roaming emergency offices that went to hotels in order to provide services for the evacuees . Finally , on the issue of urban planning and development , Arbel had the ministry pass temporary executive orders to cut bureaucracy in order to speedily construct new schools and medical centers for the evacuees.In the days and weeks after the massacre , some of the survivors were traumatized to the extent that they were not willing to leave their hotel rooms in order to meet with the roaming immigration offices . This led Arbel to wonder why they could not order new documents online , and he worked with the defense and other authorities to begin providing this service , whose pilot is set to begin at the end of April . Wait times in Israel for immigration services such as renewing a passport are notoriously long , and the ability to order a new passport online could drastically improve this . The idea to enable online documentation orders was an example of how the ministry&rsquo;s ad hoc adaptation to war needs led to broader initiatives , Arbel explained.He said he also puts a specific emphasis on services to Arab municipalities . & ldquo;On the day I entered office I said that we must understand that we are public servants of all of the citizens of Israel & ndash ; those who voted for us and those who didn&rsquo;t , even those who are acting against us , & rdquo ; Arbel said.He added that at a certain point when there were protesters outside of his home , he said to his children that he is happy to live in a country in which people can protest outside the homes of elected officials , which is not to be taken for granted.Dealing with Arab municipalities includes unique challenges & ndash ; a major one , for example , was Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich refusing in 2023 to channel NIS 200 million of funding due to the concern that it could end up in the hands of criminal organizations . Arbel confronted Smotrich and succeeded in getting the funds through . In some rare cases , there were also management problems , such as certain families who won the municipal election refusing to provide services to other families . Arbel added that & ldquo;good things&rdquo ; are happening in Arab local authorities , citing as an example the town Jatt near Haifa , which elected in the recent municipal election a young engineer who is unaffiliated with large families . This shows that residents understand the importance of proper governance aimed first and foremost at improving their daily lives.Arbel views local authorities as key factors in bridging social gaps . & ldquo;The goal of local authorities is to break through cement ceilings , & rdquo ; he said . Socioeconomic gaps in Israel are unacceptably high for a country the size of a district in California , and correct investment by municipalities , such as in fundamental aspects of formal and informal education & ndash ; schoolrooms , teachers , hot meals , etc . & ndash ; could serve as the basis for real social mobility , which Arbel said is & ldquo;one of the most significant tools in our national resilience . & rdquo;The war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in antisemitism worldwide since October 7 has led to increased interest by Diaspora Jews in moving to Israel . Another notable initiative that Arbel mentioned was creating an & ldquo;aliyah eligibility document . & rdquo ; What happens , Arbel explained , is that potential olim sometimes express interest in moving to Israel but do not follow through with the process , such that if they want to renew it later on they will have to start afresh . Instead , Arbel proposed enabling these families to complete all of the necessary paperwork without actually making the move & ndash ; and thus enabling them to make aliyah immediately in the future if they wish.Arbel preferred not to express his views on the situation in Gaza and the public debate about how much Israel should concede in a hostage deal . But perhaps more important than his work in the Interior Ministry and his support of haredi enlistment is his sympathy for the families of the hostages.He said he is concerned by criticism that ministers had not met enough with the families of hostages since the war broke out , and said that he meets at least once a week with a family . The meetings are difficult , and the families are experiencing immense pain and anger , but as a government minister Arbel said he does not have the right to avoid the families . He added that he & ldquo;allows himself to cry with the families , & rdquo ; and that his moral duty is & ldquo;first and foremost to see their pain . & rdquo ; & nbsp ;","haredi , harvard , home front command : the enigma of moshe arbel"
2024-03-30 21:16:34.817,jpost,"Simona Steinbrecher had no information about her youngest daughter , Doron , for more than 100 days after Hamas kidnapped her from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on the morning of October 7 . The last message Simona received from Doron was a WhatsApp voice note in which she mentioned that the terrorists had taken her . & ldquo;Around 10 am , Doron called me and said she heard terrorists and was afraid . She was crying . Then she sent an audio message saying that they got her . It was terrible . Until now , I go to sleep and wake up with her voice in my head , & rdquo ; Simona said.After 107 days of captivity , on January 26 , Hamas released a video featuring Doron and two other hostages , Daniella Gilboa and Karina Ariev . The video was edited together , and the women asked the Israeli government to bring them back home . & ldquo;I was very happy when I saw the video because , until then , we heard nothing about Doron . No one who came back saw her . But with that , I was very afraid and worried because I can see that she is not well . Now I can&rsquo;t even think about how terrible it is for her to be in Gaza all this time , & rdquo ; Simona added.According to Simona , Doron has a serious hormonal health issue and needs to have medicine every day . & ldquo;I can see from how she looks in the video that they didn&rsquo;t give her the medicine , & rdquo ; Simona said.The hostages who have returned from Gaza have shared with Simona alarming reports . The situation is dire , with severe shortages of food , water , and a place to sleep . The remaining female hostages there are facing especially brutal treatment by the terrorists . Simona is gravely concerned about the situation and emphasizes the urgent need for global attention to address it . & ldquo;We heard the stories of the people who came back from Gaza , and they say terrible things , & rdquo ; she said , adding : & ldquo;We are very afraid about what is happening there . & rdquo;Simona relayed the story of returned hostage Amit Soussana , who recounted sexual assault while in captivity , a thought that terrifies Doron&rsquo;s mother.Amit shared with the world that while in Gaza , she was held alone , chained up in darkness and was forced to commit sexual acts for her Hamas captor . & ldquo;What else does the world need to know ? & rdquo ; asked Simona . & ldquo;Why do they say it [ sexual assault ] is not happening there , when the women who are coming back tell us that it happened ? The whole world should cry about it and do everything to stop this ! & rdquo ; exclaimed Simona , an incredibly strong and courageous woman whose feelings are beyond description . & ldquo;That morning , my daughter was in bed in her pajamas , and they took her . What did she do to them ? Why take her ? They took babies , little kids , women , elderly&mdash;everyone ! For what ? & rdquo ; she asked.Despite experiencing unimaginable emotional pain and horror , Simona continues to fiercely fight for the world to recognize the heinous crimes being committed against hostages and unite to combat terrorism once and for all . & ldquo;The world needs to know how brutal Hamas is , & rdquo ; Simona insisted . & ldquo;They are not people ; they just want to kill . I don&rsquo;t understand why the world doesn&rsquo;t scream about what is happening . The world needs to tell them to stop . & rdquo;Simona believes that the problem in the ongoing conflict is not Israel but rather Hamas&rsquo ; refusal to engage in negotiations and reach an agreement . & ldquo;Sinwar doesn&rsquo;t want a deal , & rdquo ; she said , referring to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar . & ldquo;When we [ Israel ] are close to the deal , he always has new conditions he wants Israel to do . How can you make a deal with someone who changes his mind all the time ? It is impossible , & rdquo ; she claimed.Simona&rsquo;s message is clear and urgent : We must unite as a global community with a singular objective&mdash;to exert pressure on Hamas to release the hostages and agree to a cease-fire . Only collective efforts can make a difference , according to Simona . & ldquo;We need Qatar , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , the United States and all the other countries to tell Hamas : & lsquo;now you have to make this deal , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; Simona pleaded . & ldquo;I want the world to see the real picture of what happened here , & rdquo ; she said.Simona strongly believes that there is a frightening connection between terrorism in Israel and the recent attacks happening around the world . She emphasizes that the world needs to recognize this trend and understand that what Israel is going through now is just the tip of the iceberg of a much larger , global problem . & ldquo;We see the attacks that are happening in France , in England , in the United States , in Russia . People need to think and realize that if we don&rsquo;t stop them [ terrorists ] now , they will come to your country , & rdquo ; she explained.Even amid the fear and desperation of not having seen her daughter in six months , Simona&rsquo;s thoughts extend to the innocent people in Gaza . She believes that defeating Hamas will be the key to providing relief to those who are currently enduring the harsh realities of war , as Hamas is responsible for the fact that people in the region do not have food . & ldquo;The whole world must stop Hamas also to save innocent people in Gaza . Hamas doesn&rsquo;t let them take food , and this is the real picture , & rdquo ; asserted Simona , who continued to share details of some of the crimes committed by Hamas and its leader , Sinwar , towards people in the region.She also asserted that despite receiving aid from other countries and Israel , Hamas hoards food for themselves and prevents civilians from accessing it by resorting to violence and killing Gazans who attempt to take the aid . & ldquo;People in Gaza don&rsquo;t have food not because Israel doesn&rsquo;t give it to them , but because Hamas doesn&rsquo;t let anyone have it , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;The world needs to know the truth . Sinwar doesn&rsquo;t care about his people . If the world wants good for the civilians in Gaza . they must tell Sinwar to make a deal , & rdquo ; added Simona.Simona Recounts the Horror of Oct . 7&ldquo;It began at six and a half in the morning . Hamas came from the air , with the cars , from all the places , and there were hundreds of them in our kibbutz , & rdquo ; recounted Simona , who described how on the day of the massacre , couples , individuals , and families living in Kfar Aza had to stay in their safe rooms for up to 13 hours , as did many other people in the South . & ldquo;Think about little kids who needed to be in a safe room for 11 hours , with no water and no food , in the dark . It was terrible for them , and until now , children speak about this , & rdquo ; said Simona.Recalling what she saw with her own eyes , Simona added : & ldquo;I saw how they [ Hamas terrorists ] kill people . I remember a house that burned slowly until there wasn&rsquo;t any more fire , and I knew that a couple was there , and I knew they were burning alive . & rdquo;According to Simona , Hamas killed 63 people in Kfar Aza alone . & ldquo;I want everyone who has a daughter , sister , or mother to think about what they would do if their family had to go through the same thing . Everyone who has a grandmother , grandfather , daughter , son , nephew , brother&mdash;what would you do ? & rdquo ; Simona asked rhetorically.About DoronSimona&rsquo;s daughter Doron , 31 , is a veterinary nurse . & ldquo;She likes animals and kids , and she is like a second mother to her little nephew . They love her so much . She didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong to anyone . She always wants to help everyone , & rdquo ; Simona said . & ldquo;Her work is the thing that she likes the most . All the time we had dogs in our house . She brings animals to our house and takes care of them , & rdquo ; she continued . & ldquo;I want to hold her . I miss her so much . She is my baby , and I want her to come back , & rdquo ; added Simona . & ldquo;We hear all the time that Hamas kills another hostage , and we are afraid , & rdquo ; admitted Simona .",mother of hostage victim pleads with international community to pressure hamas
2024-06-04 14:52:39.000,jpost,"& ldquo;I played sports ever since I was a child . I used to play soccer but mainly basketball , as I have been blessed with a height of 1.95 meters , & rdquo ; said Saleh Shaheen , 41 , a Druze paralympic athlete from Shfaram.Shaheen&rsquo;s life began in a typical fashion . He enlisted in the IDF in 2003 as a paratrooper and also served as a commander . After his mandatory service , he enrolled in a course led by the Airports Authority and worked at the Karni Terminal on the border of the Gaza Strip as a security guard . & ldquo;Then , on January 13 , 2005 , my life changed in just one night . & rdquo ; Three terrorists from Hamas , the PFLP , and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade penetrated the Karni Terminal by planting an explosive device in the wall ; they killed six civilians . & ldquo;I arrived at the area of the explosion to fight the terrorists , but it was pitch dark , as electricity was down due to the explosion , leaving me exposed . I faced the first terrorist , and we exchanged fire . He shot four bullets towards my left leg , also damaging my stomach and intestines , & rdquo ; Shaheen said . & ldquo;It was pretty serious damage , though I didn&rsquo;t feel at all that I was injured . I shot , and the terrorist and I fell together . Two other terrorists infiltrated , and the rest of the security guards arrived . There I was , with a dead terrorist lying next to me and an exchange of fire taking place between the guards and the terrorists over my head . I managed , with my last bit of strength , to crawl and make it to safety , where another Druze security guard saw me . He tried to lift me , but I weighed 115 kilos , so it took him two or three more attempts until he managed and brought me to the back office . & ldquo;They put me in an ambulance and sped to Soroka [ Hospital ] . I remember the ride ; it&rsquo;s probably the longest one I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life . I started to feel the pain . I wanted to fall asleep , but the medic wouldn&rsquo;t let me . When the ambulance door opened , I put my hand over my face so that no one would recognize me , and there&rsquo;s a famous picture showing that scene . I was in the operating room for 17 hours straight . When I woke up , I saw my parents next to me and began to fathom what had happened . I tore a main artery in my leg , and somehow , I stayed alive . & rdquo;Shaheen stayed for three more weeks in Soroka until his situation was stabilized , and then he was sent to Rambam in Haifa , which was more convenient for his family . & ldquo;I spent three challenging months at Rambam , and although many people came to visit , it wasn&rsquo;t a particularly easy time for me . I got metal implants for my legs , and I needed to train to rehabilitate them so I could attempt to go back to sports . My entire life revolved around sports until that point , & rdquo ; he reminisced.First steps in Paralympic sports An acquaintance approached Shaheen a little over five years ago and suggested he try wheelchair basketball . & ldquo;It seemed unnatural to me at first , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;I tried and fell several times and ended up thinking that I don&rsquo;t have the strength for more falls and injuries and recovering . At end of the day , I had learned to accept my injury and looked at it as my fate . I told myself that I must get up ; I can&rsquo;t stay in the same place . So I continued training and playing wheelchair basketball in Haifa and Tel Aviv , and even tried out wheelchair badminton . & rdquo;Shaheen ended up joining a mixed Jewish-Arab group in Majd Al-Kroum in the North , winning a national cup in the first year and making it to the Premier League.In 2019 , Shaheen was approached again , this time with an offer to join paralympic rowing . & ldquo;I had no idea what it was at first . I was told that it involved two training sessions every day and much traveling , & rdquo ; he recounted . & ldquo;I hesitated at first , but I saw the challenging aspects and took my abilities to the limit , and decided that this is a sport I want to be a part of . & rdquo;Shaheen started training with a group of four , but then the condition of his leg deteriorated . The implant fell out , and he was hospitalized again & ndash ; until he was classified as PR2 , which is defined as having functional use of arms and trunk but with weakness or absence of leg function to slide the seat of the boat , rowing on a double boat for a duo of a man and a woman . & ldquo;When I started this classification , they were only missing a female rower , and I was on hold for a while . Then , one day , I received a call saying that they found a young woman , Shahar Milfelder , who had cancer at the age of 16 and had to have part of her pelvis removed . I jumped right in and went back to rowing . & rdquo;Shaheen and Milfelder began training together only two years ago . & ldquo;Every day , I drive around 230 kilometers , wake up at five in the morning , perform two training sessions , and go back . This routine is very demanding , especially at the expense of family and work . I own a convenience store and had to hire a local employee so that I could be devoted to sports alone , & rdquo ; Shaheen explained.Supported by scholarships and aid from the Israel Paralympic Committee , Shaheen and Milfelder made a significant leap and advanced to the World Championship less than a year ago . There , they missed the chance to get a ticket to the Paralympic games due to some changes in categories for qualifications . & ldquo;We missed the ticket by 30 hundredths of a second and even came in first place in the second round ; we were really bummed . Then , two weeks ago , there was a & lsquo;last chance&rsquo ; competition for the last two tickets . People believed in us ; we arrived as prepared as we could be . Then we finished first in the first round , and in the second one , we finished second with a difference of 40 hundredths of a second . & rdquo;This was enough to send the duo to the Paralympic Games . & ldquo;I was literally in tears , & rdquo ; said Shaheen . & ldquo;Now we are getting back to preparing for the Olympics . Next month , we will fly for a long training camp , and then in August , we will move to Paris to give our performance at the Olympics . I want to thank the Paralympics Association for its trust and support in all fields , from nutrition to treatments , scholarships , and even travel reimbursements . & rdquo;Back at home , Shaheen said that his community had barely heard of this branch of sports . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s not really well known in my society . Not many people at home contacted me , except the sports department in the municipality . Truth be told , I myself didn&rsquo;t know anything about it before I started , and I didn&rsquo;t realize how fascinating and challenging the world of rowing can be . & rdquo ; For this reason , Shaheen said he hopes to change things in the future . & ldquo;Hopefully , after the Olympics , I will work to promote rowing in Israel generally and in the North more specifically , & rdquo ; he said.Asked what he is looking forward to most , Shaheen said that , more than anything , he is excited to leave a mark in history . & ldquo;My message is that to achieve your dreams , you must stop everything and focus on the goal . It&rsquo;s true that I had to put my business to the side and that it comes at the expense of other things . But this is what it takes to make your dream come true . & rdquo ;",druze rower qualifies for paralympic games with jewish counterpart

2024-05-14 12:05:53.173,jpost,"Heading in a north-easterly direction from the Arc de Triomphe down Avenue Hoch to number 37 , one reaches Le Royal Monceau hotel ; at its entrance , a red portico and statued heads that cast their gaze over everyone who passes through.The hotel , once a beehive of activity for diplomats , intellectuals , artists , celebrities , and even the commanders of the Allied Armed forces during World War II , in 1946 hosted one of the more curious chance meetings between two political luminaries of the 20th century.Fresh from Black Saturday & ndash ; the arrest of 3,000 Jews , including most of the Zionist executive leadership across Palestine & ndash ; and the sealing of Jewish Agency buildings on June 28 , David Ben-Gurion , then-leader of the Jewish Agency , sat in his hotel room pondering his organization&rsquo;s next move . & nbsp;Paris , in the early post-war years , was the European center of Zionist activity . While in the city , Ben-Gurion was helping to coordinate the westward migration of Jews who had survived the Holocaust in Eastern Europe , Jews he had hoped would be interested in emigrating to Palestine to help found a new Jewish state . & nbsp;Staying on the floor above Ben-Gurion at Le Royal Monceau was a&nbsp;skinny gentleman with the elliptical eyes distinct to natives of Indochina , his hairline receding , and a thin , wispy goatee resting on his chin . To his family , growing up , he was known as Nguyễn Sinh Cung , but by 1946 , he was the prime minister of the newly-found Democratic Republic of Vietnam ( North Vietnam ) and known to the rest of the world as Ho Chi Minh.That summer , Ho Chi Minh was in Paris for follow-up talks surrounding Vietnamese independence from the French . Although captured by the Japanese during WWII , French Indochina had long been a colonial jewel in the French empire&rsquo;s crown with important natural and strategic resources , its prominent location close to China and other trade routes.Ben-Gurion related to former Maariv correspondent Shmuel Segev , who would write a book on Vietnam , that each day for two weeks , Ho Chi Minh would come down to his room or he would climb a flight of stairs to the Vietnamese leader&rsquo;s quarters , and the two would talk.During one conversation , Ben-Gurion shared insights into his ongoing problems , prompting Ho Chi Minh to suggest the establishment of a Jewish government in North Vietnam . & ldquo;He gave the impression of being a nice man , & rdquo ; Ben-Gurion would later recall of Ho Chi Minh . & nbsp ; & ldquo;During one of those conversations , he proposed that I immediately establish a Jewish government-in-exile on Vietnamese territory . I thanked him and said that when the time came , I would consider his offer . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Despite sharing a roof , and becoming & ldquo;very friendly&rdquo ; over the weeks as the former Israeli prime minister stated , & ldquo;for obvious reasons , [ the offer ] was unacceptable . & rdquo ; & ldquo;I am certain that we shall be able to establish a Jewish government in Palestine , & rdquo ; Ben-Gurion reportedly said , adding that if he wrote to Ho Chi Minh , the latter might invite him to visit North Vietnam . & nbsp ; & ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t use Communist slogans , & rdquo ; Ben-Gurion said , adding that Ho Chi Minh desired to give the impression that he was a nationalist leader fighting only for his people&rsquo;s independence . & nbsp;Ben-Gurion also related how he had been able to judge how the Vietnamese negotiations were proceeding with the French by the length of the red carpet at Ho Chi Minh&rsquo;s door . & ldquo;At first , the red carpet extended from the street to HoChi Minh&rsquo;s door , & rdquo ; the Jewish leader recalled . & ldquo;In stages , it was removed from the pavement outside , the lobby , and the staircase . & ldquo;When the carpet outside his door was removed , I knew the talks had failed , and sure enough , a few hours later , he came to my room to say goodbye . He was tired , worn out , and disappointed , and he told me nothing remained but to fight . & rdquo;A few months later , the First Indochina War began between Vietnamese forces and France.Two roads to independenceDESPITE THE close relationship developed over only a couple of weeks one Paris summer , diplomatic relations between Vietnam and Israel took decades to come to fruition.On Friday , May 14 , 1948 , David Ben-Gurion stood in Tel Aviv and formally declared the independent State of Israel . The next day , the Arab armies of Egypt , Syria , Jordan , and Iraq invaded , along with a corps of volunteers from Saudi Arabia , Lebanon , and Yemen . The burgeoning Jewish State prevailed , although it would face many more obstacles down the road for its freedom.The fight for Vietnamese independence would take a much darker and longer path.While Vietnam was formally partitioned into South and North Vietnam in 1954 , at the end of the First Indochina War , with Israel supporting the Geneva Agreements , diplomatic relations between the two nations never materialized . & nbsp;Communist North Vietnam maintained a strong relationship with the socialist powers of the day , the Soviet Union and Maoist China , while also cultivating ties with the Arab nations . Israel , on the other side of the metaphorical global Iron Curtain , provided technical aid to South Vietnam without establishing formal diplomatic channels.In June 1967 , as Israel launched a pre-emptive strike against the armies of Egypt , Syria , and Jordan , North Vietnam&rsquo;s President Ho Chi Minh wrote in a personal wire to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser , & ldquo;We are highly indignant at the action of Israeli reactionary agents of the United States and British imperialists . They are doomed to ignominious defeat . & rdquo ; & nbsp;By 1967 , the North Vietnamese and their communist army , the Viet Cong , were busy themselves fighting a guerilla war against the South Vietnamese and their US allies . By 1969 , over half a million US troops were stationed in the country , and the Vietnam War would claim the lives of almost 60,000 US servicemen and women.Ho Chi Minh would die in September 1969 , never living to see the united , communist Vietnam that he had dreamed of and fought so long for . In 1975 , two years after the official end of US military involvement , South Vietnam&rsquo;s capital , Saigon , fell to the Viet Cong and was renamed Ho Chi Minh City . & nbsp;Ben-Gurion&rsquo;s death would follow that of his revolutionary friend a few years later , in December 1973 . After his final years following his retirement from politics living in a modest home in Kibbutz Sde Boker in the Negev Desert , he was buried there alongside his wife , Paula.Israel-Vietnam relationsISRAEL AND VIETNAM&rsquo;S paths would cross relatively infrequently over the following decades , with one particular infamous encounter taking place . & nbsp;On June 10 , 1977 , a remarkable rescue operation unfolded when the Israeli freighter ship , the Yuvali , bound for Taiwan , spotted a group of passengers in need . This group , consisting of approximately 66 Vietnamese refugees , marked the beginning of a series of arrivals in Israel between 1977 and 1979 of over 300 people fleeing communist Vietnam.Israeli prime minister at the time , Menachem Begin , drew a poignant parallel , likening the plight of these refugees to that of Holocaust survivors . & nbsp;Begin famously remarked , & ldquo;We have never forgotten the boat with 900 Jews , St . Louis , having left Germany in the last weeks before the Second World War . . . traveling from harbor to harbor , from country to country , crying out for refuge . They were refused . . . Therefore , it was natural . . . to give those people a haven in the Land of Israel . & rdquo;Inspired by this ethos of compassion and solidarity , Begin directed Israeli diplomats to extend a lifeline to the Vietnamese refugees , offering them asylum in Israel . In a poignant moment captured by an Associated Press broadcast on October 26 , 1979 , a grateful refugee expressed profound appreciation to the government of Israel and to Begin , acknowledging their role in opening their homeland at a time when other nations hesitated to offer assistance in the face of communist oppression.Vietnam and Israel would finally establish official diplomatic relations on July 12 , 1993 , followed by Israel opening its resident embassy in the capital Hanoi in December 1993Ben-Gurion&rsquo;s recollections of his Paris meetings with the tall , skinny Vietnamese man , spotlight the convergence of two revolutionary movements in one place and offer a unique perspective on one of the most important & ndash ; and instrumental & ndash ; periods in the 20th century . & nbsp;In the post-WWII world , with national borders being redrawn , either along class lines or ethnicity lines , two dedicated men had found themselves in a Parisian hotel room , drawn together by history and the common bond of their enduring fight for their people&rsquo;s independence . ",a tale of two leaders : the paris meetings between ben-gurion and ho chi minh

2021-05-13 22:07:53.850,jpost,"& nbsp;On Wednesday , the US-Israel relationship seemed , well , normal . The US was supporting Israel in the ways it always has in the repeated confrontations with Hamas since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005 . & nbsp ; The US blocked the United Nations Security Council from making a statement that was critical of Israel . & nbsp ; US President Joe Biden called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , & ldquo;condemned the rocket attacks by Hamas . . . [ and ] conveyed his unwavering support for Israel&rsquo;s security and for Israel&rsquo;s legitimate right to defend itself , while protecting civilians . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Secretary of State Antony Blinken emphasized that & ldquo;there is a very clear and absolute distinction between the terrorist organization Hamas that is indiscriminately raining down rockets targeting civilians , and Israel&rsquo;s response defending itself , targeting the terrorists raining down rockets on Israel . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Blinken dispatched Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Israel and Palestinian Affairs Hady Amr to Israel to help in the de-escalation efforts . & nbsp ; But all that happened on Wednesday , three days after Hamas shot rockets into Jerusalem and five days after a serious uptick in violence in Jerusalem . These are short amounts of time in the grand scheme of things , but a long time in terms of an escalation . & nbsp ; The night before that , at the very same time that Hamas shot 150 rockets into Tel Aviv and central Israel , sending millions of Israelis into bomb shelters , the Biden administration&rsquo;s spokespeople synced up on a & ldquo;both sides&rdquo ; message , despite one side being Israel , a US ally and a democracy , and the other being Hamas , designated by the US as a terrorist organization . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We condemn ongoing rocket attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups , including against Jerusalem . We also stand against extremism that has inflicted violence on both communities , & rdquo ; White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said . & nbsp ; Psaki soon moved on to adopt the Palestinians&rsquo ; narrative that this is about the Sheikh Jarrah/Shimon Hatzadik land dispute & ndash ; the ruling on which has yet to be made , and whose residents have not actually been evicted & ndash ; rather than taking in the context of rising Palestinian and Arab violence for the past month . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We believe Palestinians and Israelis deserve equal measures of freedom , security , dignity , and prosperity , & rdquo ; Psaki said . & ldquo;And US officials , in recent weeks , have spoken candidly with Israeli officials about how evictions of Palestinian families who have lived for years , sometimes decades , in their homes and of demolitions of these homes work against our common interests in achieving a solution to the conflict . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Similarly , State Department spokesman Ned Price said minutes earlier that & ldquo;Israel has the right to defend itself and to respond to rocket attacks . The Palestinian people also have the right to safety and security , just as Israelis do . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We are also deeply concerned about the reported loss of life in Gaza and Israel , including the deaths of children as well as many innocent civilians injured . Similarly , in Jerusalem , where there reportedly have been hundreds of Palestinians injured , as well as Israeli police , we call on all sides to exercise restraint and to exercise calm . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Emerging from bomb shelters soon after those statements were made , the Israelis paying attention to Psaki and Price may have scratched their heads as to why Israel&rsquo;s greatest ally was lecturing them while they were rushing their families to safety from rockets launched indiscriminately at civilians by a terrorist organization . & nbsp ; Over the past week , the Biden administration&rsquo;s messages also focused on & ldquo;de-escalation . & rdquo ; They&rsquo;re engaging at all levels , officials and spokespeople said , to encourage Israelis and Palestinians to de-escalate . Pushed by journalists in numerous press briefings to explain what that means , what they&rsquo;re actually doing to bring the sides away from the brink of war , the members and representatives of the administration didn&rsquo;t have much to say . & nbsp ; MORE THAN one senior Israeli official said they&rsquo;re satisfied with the US position , pointing to statements by Biden and Blinken , as well as another by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan , as & ldquo;very supportive , & rdquo ; as well as to American efforts in the UN to block the statement against Israel . & nbsp ; In other words , the things that they are doing , on a practical level , are supportive of Israel , and they are keeping Israel in the loop , as an ally would be expected to do . & nbsp ; Israeli officials also said they don&rsquo;t feel that the US is pressuring them to stop the operation in Gaza , another clear sign of support . & nbsp ; But one of those Israeli officials also said that they & ldquo;don&rsquo;t have a clue . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; For four months , the Biden administration made Israel and the Palestinians a low priority . & nbsp ; & ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t even think about Gaza and Hamas , & rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo;When the Palestinian election came up , they didn&rsquo;t know how to handle it . Elections are a democratic value , but Hamas could be elected , so they played the same game Israel did . They didn&rsquo;t oppose it publicly , but they sent messages they won&rsquo;t be mad if it&rsquo;s postponed . . . . And now Hamas is frustrated . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; On the one hand , the Biden administration & ndash ; from Blinken and Sullivan to Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield to State Department officials & ndash ; really is constantly in contact with Israelis , as its members have been saying in their statements and briefings . & nbsp ; On the other , the administration has been fixated on Jerusalem , the Temple Mount and Sheikh Jarrah in private conversations , accepting the Palestinian narrative on the events . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Nothing changed on the Temple Mount , except that Hamas is trying to present itself as defending the holy places , like Arafat did in 2000 . . . . Hamas is frustrated that the Palestinian Authority postponed the election , thought it would strengthen them , and now they&rsquo;re trying to build themselves up . The narrative that Jerusalem is the real problem is that of our opponents , & rdquo ; the Israeli official said . & nbsp ; Israeli officials have found themselves being asked by members of the Biden administration to stop a possible Supreme Court ruling to evict four Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even understand the argument , & rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo;We&rsquo;re a democracy . We did the maximum to postpone the ruling , but we don&rsquo;t control the courts . It&rsquo;s the same court that evicts settlers . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; As for complaints about Israel using stun grenades in the al-Aksa Mosque , the official pointed out that Israeli police do not use guns at the holy site , but that people throwing boulders at worshipers at the Western Wall and Molotov cocktails at police cannot be given immunity just because they use a mosque as a launching pad . & nbsp ; An Israeli official also expressed concern that the Biden administration is more supportive in private conversations than in public statements . & nbsp ; & ldquo;They used to say that Israel doesn&rsquo;t have foreign policy , only domestic politics . Our feeling is they&rsquo;re constantly looking at the left-wing extremes [ of the Democratic Party ] that are against us and their pressure on them , & rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo;They&rsquo;re putting Jerusalem in all their messages , even though it&rsquo;s not really connected , and then they talk about the need for restraint on both sides . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; In a way , it seemed like the administration was caught off guard when the violence spiraled . & nbsp ; Some have argued that the government in Jerusalem did not take the potential for a conflagration seriously enough , and Israel will have to reckon with how its leadership vacuum left it unprepared . That may have colored Washington&rsquo;s initial reaction . & nbsp ; But it didn&rsquo;t have to be that way . UAE-based news site The National said that & ldquo;Washington began to pay attention to messages from Arab governments only last week , & rdquo ; after weeks of warnings that a crisis was brewing in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Shira Efron , a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies , also noted the & ldquo;bifurcated message&rdquo ; coming from the Biden administration , with messages that create an equivalence between Israel and its enemies , while also saying & ldquo;this is a just fight , Hamas is a cruel terrorist organization and Israel should fight back . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Reading between the lines , Efron said she thinks the Biden administration is & ldquo;saying Israel has got it ; they can handle it . I don&rsquo;t see them actively working to de-escalate . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Even Amr&rsquo;s visit may be largely symbolic , because , as Efron pointed out , the US doesn&rsquo;t speak with Hamas . At most , Amr can work with other mediators that do speak with Hamas , like Turkey , Qatar or Egypt , and then relay messages to Israel . & nbsp ; Efron questioned whether the Biden administration has & ldquo;a road map for de-escalation . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; She noted the Biden administration has de-emphasized the Israeli-Palestinian conflict : & ldquo;They have bigger fish to fry , like China or climate change , but the fact is that there is no assistant secretary for Near East affairs , and there is no ambassador here . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Even the most competent and well-meaning person & ndash ; and I think [ Amr ] does mean well & ndash ; cannot do this on his own , & rdquo ; Efron said . & ldquo;He has no staff , and I don&rsquo;t think this is a priority issue&rdquo ; for the Biden administration . & nbsp ; If the latest events are a wake-up call for the administration , it still cannot immediately solve its lack of preparation for a crisis in the region , Efron said . It will take time for Congress to confirm presidential appointments . & nbsp ; THE TONE from Washington would have been drastically different if former president Donald Trump were still in office , but Efron pushed back against the argument that there would be significant changes on the ground . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this has much to do with the US approach . Biden said they&rsquo;re going to go back to a more traditional approach , but the fact is that not much has changed . It hasn&rsquo;t been transformational ; it&rsquo;s not like the Palestinians are now welcome in Washington with a PLO mission , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Rather , Efron argued , between Ramadan , COVID-19 frustrations and the cancellation of the Palestinian election , violence against Israel was a & ldquo;win-win&rdquo ; for Hamas , and the US reaction was unlikely to be a primary or even secondary consideration . & nbsp ; & ldquo;In 2009 , 2012 and 2014 , there were lengthy IDF operations where we had a US that was more active in favor of the Palestinians , and that didn&rsquo;t help either , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Prof . Eytan Gilboa of Bar-Ilan University , however , argued that Trump would have more full-throatedly condemned Hamas and Islamic Jihad , and that would have had a palpable impact . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Trump punished the Palestinians . Biden is trying to appease them . So I think there would have been a different story if Trump had been in the White House , in terms of opposing and condemning Islamic Jihad and Hamas and supporting Israel more , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; Israel&rsquo;s strategy , Gilboa explained , is to punish Hamas and Islamic Jihad severely , which will take time . US statements calling to stop hostilities weakens Israel in pursuit of that strategy . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The American response overall has been timid , disappointing and irrelevant . . . saying Palestinians in Gaza have the right for safety and security just as Israelis do . . . as if this is a confrontation between equals , & rdquo ; Gilboa said . & ldquo;Both sides are called on to reduce hostilities & ndash ; Israel and a terrorist organization designated by the US . & nbsp ; & ldquo;It&rsquo;s not evenhandedness . It&rsquo;s stupidity . This inadvertently encourages Hamas and Islamic Jihad to continue , & rdquo ; he added . & nbsp ; Similar to the Israeli official , Gilboa thought the Biden administration has read the situation wrong by focusing on Sheikh Jarrah , which he called & ldquo;irrelevant . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;The main point is Hamas and Islamic Jihad&rsquo;s goal of turning the West Bank into Gaza , of taking it over . . . . If you don&rsquo;t understand that , then your policies will miss the point , & rdquo ; he stated . & ldquo;The alumni of the Obama administration seem to have learned nothing . They&rsquo;re presented as very experienced in foreign policy and national security ; that has yet to be proven . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; By making the Middle East a lower priority , Biden will now learn that & ldquo;if you run away from the Middle East , the Middle East runs after you , & rdquo ; Gilboa warned . & ldquo;The US has to take a position . . . . It requires fresh thinking , but what I see are old habits . & rdquo ;","as israel-palestinian conflict rages , biden struggles to catch up"

2024-05-04 21:50:24.507,jpost,"In the stark confines of Eshel Prison near Beersheba , Israel , an unconventional class of students recently completed an extraordinary educational journey . Last week , a group of 13 inmates graduated from a groundbreaking Holocaust education project unlike any traditional academic setting . These weren't ordinary students ; they were prisoners , some serving life sentences for serious crimes , others detained for minor offenses . Yet , they all shared a new academic pursuit&mdash;understanding the Holocaust , its historical significance , and the indelible lessons it imparts on courage and humanity.Across Israel , this initiative is part of a broader educational movement within the penal system . Over the past few months , more than 150 inmates engaged in similar programs , and a total of 300 were expected to complete their studies by the year's end . The program's uniqueness lies not only in its setting but in its transformative impact on its participants , challenging them to rethink values and personal accountability.A glimpse inside the prison education systemFor the first time , Yad Vashem , Israel's official memorial to the victims of the Holocaust , together with the Israeli Prison Service , allowed insights into these transformative sessions . During a rare and enlightening meeting with inmates , they shared how their initial encounters with stories of the Holocaust moved them profoundly . The tales of suffering and heroism opened their eyes to a world where human values such as courage , sacrifice , and perseverance played pivotal roles.Educating beyond the basicsThe program , known as "" Victory of the Spirit , "" provided rigorous weekly sessions where inmates from various backgrounds came together to learn about the Holocaust . Rabbi Tehila Heitman Demony , head of the community values sector at the prison , explained that the program aimed to instill a deep understanding of the Holocaust's historical events while intertwining lessons on personal and communal values.This year's curriculum , under the theme "" Communities , "" focused on fostering a sense of collective identity and responsibility&mdash;poignant subjects for individuals often isolated from society . The curriculum was scheduled to culminate in June with a day trip to Yad Vashem for prisoners who met certain behavioral and educational criteria , thus providing them with a tangible connection to the stories they had studied.Transformations on a personal levelAmong the poignant narratives was that of A ' , a young man from central Israel , convicted of manslaughter . A ' was initially indifferent to the program but found himself profoundly affected as the course progressed . "" At first , I didn't see the relevance of the Holocaust to me , "" A ' shared . His perspective dramatically shifted when he discovered that his own grandfather was a Holocaust survivor . This revelation deepened his engagement with the material and provided a personal connection to the history being taught.Idit , the education officer at Eshel Prison who coordinated the "" Victory of the Spirit "" project , observed significant changes in the prisoners ' attitudes and understanding . "" They become ambassadors of knowledge , eager to share what they've learned and inspire others within the prison community , "" Idit noted.Impacts beyond individual growthAyelet Aviv , an instructor from Yad Vashem involved since 2016 , highlighted the diverse composition of her classes , which included many prisoners from minority backgrounds . "" Their thirst for knowledge is incredible , "" Aviv said . "" They are eager to learn , to ask questions , and to write about their thoughts and feelings . It's about educating and transforming these individuals , providing them with tools for personal growth and a deeper understanding of human values . "" For M ' , an Arab Israeli imprisoned for money laundering , the program offered an insight into a crucial part of history that he had never known before . "" The only place I thought I could learn such things was in prison , "" M ' reflected . His statement underscored the transformative potential of education , even&mdash;or perhaps especially&mdash;in the most unlikely settings.As these prisoners reached the end of their course , the impact of "" Victory of the Spirit "" extended beyond the confines of their cells . It fostered a broader dialogue about history , humanity , and redemption , proving that education can indeed be a powerful catalyst for change . This project not only educates but also rebuilds individuals , enabling them to emerge as informed citizens ready to contribute positively to society . M ' summed up the sentiment by stating , "" If everyone learns from the Holocaust , perhaps we can finally achieve justice . ""","yad vashem , prison service reveal holocaust education for inmates"
2024-04-10 00:36:25.607,jpost,"North of the Gaza Strip , the surf is pounding the beaches south of Ashkelon . One of these beaches is known as Zikim , and it shares a name with a kibbutz on a hill above it.This is a beautiful area . There is a small pond and stream near the beach , and dunes with small stout layers of brush stretch up from the waterfront toward the east . The dunes form a kind of frame to the area , setting off the kibbutz and a road that runs down to the sea from an industrial area of Ashkelon.Today , this area is deserted . The beach , which once hosted the toned bodies of young men and women from the area who came to enjoy the spot , and the fishermen who would come on weekends to try their hand at a catch , are gone . It is all gone because Hamas attacked this beach on October 7 , when it invaded two dozen points along the border with Israel and carried out its massacre.I came to this area on October 8 , trying to reach the coastal area because there are several IDF posts here . I thought that with the war unfolding , it might be a good place to find a story . At the time , I didn&rsquo;t know there was still fighting going on in this area , and terrorists were lurking in the bushes and dunes.I learned the area was an active combat zone when I came upon the bodies of two terrorists , and a still-running Savannah van parked next to them , on October 8 near the fence that runs around Kibbutz Zikim . The fighting here continued for days.On October 11 , several soldiers from the Maglan special unit were killed in this area . Flags with their names are now draped on a concrete shelter along the road . Inside , their comrades have written their names and left candles and a kippah in their memory.Six months laterIT HAS been six months since that day . October 8 was the second day of the war . Six months later , I was in Kibbutz Zikim , looking out onto the road where I had encountered the dead terrorists and the van . A member of the community recalled the same scene unfolding on October 7 from inside Zikim.Although terrorists were able to attack and infiltrate the IDF posts near the border , killing soldiers and massacring civilians on Zikim Beach , the kibbutz itself was saved by the quick response of its emergency response team and soldiers.Today , the kibbutz seems like it is slowly returning to life , and some of the residents have returned . The community is laid out in a large circle , with houses facing the perimeter fence , looking toward the sea . It&rsquo;s bucolic and beautiful . It is also filled with peacocks for some reason . The birds apparently escaped from a local small zoo and have infested the community for years . Because there are so few human residents , the animals seem to have the run of the place.I spent October 7 and 8 traveling along the border with Gaza , seeing communities that faced the brunt of the attack on October 7 and also seeing those that were saved from the massacre . Each community has a story & ndash ; stories of tragedy , bravery , and sometimes good luck that kept people safe.Six months after the war began , it&rsquo;s important to recall that these communities are still evacuated , their residents scattered around Israel . In many cases , the communities tried to stick together , but they face an uncertain future.On the afternoon of October 8 , the IDF said it had evacuated Be&rsquo;eri , Nahal Oz , Netiv Ha&rsquo;asara , and Zikim . While Zikim had been saved from the massacre , nearby Netiv Ha&rsquo;asara , which is directly on the border with Gaza , was breached , and the terrorists murdered numerous members of the community . The terrorists also carried out massacres at Be&rsquo;eri and Nahal Oz.Nahal Oz is one of the hardest community&rsquo;s to reach today because it is close to the border , and there is an IDF checkpoint on the road leading to it . All of these communities now have soldiers at their front gates , and permission is required to enter.Nahal Oz is a unique case . To get to it , the road snakes down by the border . Several years ago , a large concrete wall was erected to shield the road from Gaza , and the wall was then painted with pastoral scenes and a giant mural indicating that the community was celebrating 70 years since its founding . Unlike Zikim , there is a sense it will take time before anyone can return to this area.On October 8 , the IDF also evacuated Nir Am , Mefalsim , Kfar Aza , Gevim , Or Haner , Ivim , Yad Mordechai , Karmiya , Kerem Shalom , Kissufim , Holit , Sufa , Nirim , Nir Oz , Ein Hashlosha , Nir Yitzhak , Magen , Re&rsquo;im , Sa&rsquo;ad , and Alumim.Today , these communities have the same struggles that Zikim and Nahal Oz face . Their residents are living in different parts of Israel , and it is not clear when services will be available for people to return to or if people will feel secure enough to return.In some communities , people return only for a few hours a day or several days a week . They might have jobs nearby , or they come to tend a garden or to do some kind of other work for the community . In the community dining halls , where there once would have been crowds or laughter , or plans for community events , there is often silence or only a few people huddled to eat.IT&rsquo;S HARD to make sense of this . On the one hand , the war in Gaza feels like it is winding down . At the highest point in Zikim , for instance , there is an old home built in 1920 by an Arab notable who had a citrus grove near here . From the roof of the old stately home , where sandbags are piled , probably from the early days of the war , one can see into Gaza . Smoke rises , and there is a rat-tat of machine-gun fire . But the sound of artillery and explosions is no longer common.Further down the border , this is not always the case . Near the site of the Supernova music festival massacre , the sound of artillery is present . Everywhere along the border , the buzzing of drones is clear . But the heavy military presence of the first months of the war is gone.It&rsquo;s not normal , because normal would mean the civilian residents have returned . It&rsquo;s abnormal . But it&rsquo;s also not war , because much of the war seems to have paused , like a country taking a deep breath and then wondering what to do next.What comes next at Kibbutz Sufa , for instance ? It sits near the border and feels forlorn . At nearby Nir Yitzhak , there are square hay bales stacked in small mountains in warehouses . Clearly , the agricultural work has gone on at a fever pitch.In fact , that&rsquo;s another contrast on the border . Work goes on everywhere in the fields . In some cases , it is done by foreign workers , who can be seen riding motorized bikes to their work . Small Thailand flags flutter from the bikes.In one field , a giant machine with long metal arms , like a massive mechanical bug in some kind of future apocalyptic movie , ambled along watering the field . It wasn&rsquo;t even clear if there was a person on the machine , bringing a sense that the future here hangs in the balance between civilians returning and machines taking over.This is not what the kibbutz pioneers of the late 1940s and 1950s had in mind when these communities were founded . They lived in tents and farmed . They took their bolt-action rifles , and later automatics , to the fields with them . They danced , and sang , and played sport . They served in elite units . They grew old.Their descendants want to return , but so far , it is mostly the older people who express steadfastness and confidence . Those with children who were abandoned for many hours on October 7 , and had to leave on October 8 , face an uncertain future . How can they return and trust the state again to protect them?The state hasn&rsquo;t returned the hostages held in Gaza . There&rsquo;s also a sense the government has abandoned these communities , that there is lack of caring for them , and that there is no government here . They are fending for themselves , like in the era of the British Mandate.These communities were once the heart of the state&rsquo;s endeavors to carve out the borders of Israel . But now they feel like they have become the ultimate periphery . & nbsp ;",gaza border communities struggling to recover six months after evacuation
2024-06-07 18:12:29.860,jpost,"& lsquo;What a night , & rdquo ; wrote Zvika Klein , Editor-in-Chief of The Jerusalem Post , on Facebook . & ldquo;It was filled with inspiration , sadness , hope , and prayer . & rdquo;On Sunday evening , June 2 , the Post hosted a special gala evening at 583 Park Avenue , prior to its Annual Conference in New York on Monday . The invitation-only cocktail reception for some 200 VIP guests was organized with Bank Leumi and was held in cooperation with the Israel Defense and Security Forum ( IDSF ) . AMIR AVIVI , founder of the forum , interviewed by Klein , stated that Israel is facing a global war on behalf of Western society but must seek strategic independence for war materials to ensure the country&rsquo;s defense . & ldquo;We are facing a global war ; this is a Chinese/Russian front , & rdquo ; he said . Consequently , the US position on military operations & ldquo;endangers not only Israel but all of Western society . & rdquo;Avivi advocated for Israeli strategic independence in munitions and other military equipment to counter the arms embargoes that Israel is facing from some of its Western allies . For Israel to be able to stand on its own without relying on others is a Zionist principle , he explained.Though the IDF is destroying Hamas on the battlefield , the forum&rsquo;s founder said , the Gazan terrorist group believes that it can survive by fostering international pressure on Israel and sparking an Israeli election.RONIT FARKASH , Director of Strategic Partnerships at IDSF , said that her son is among the soldiers fighting Hamas in Gaza . A Hamas sniper shot him , and while his ceramic vest saved him , he suffered shrapnel wounds and burns.Though still recovering from his wounds , Farkash&rsquo;s son returned to his unit in Gaza only a few days later because his brothers in arms needed him . & ldquo;That is the power of being united . That is the meaning of being connected to something bigger than just yourself , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;Our nation&rsquo;s strength lies in its people and in our ability to come together in the face of adversity . We draw courage from each other , from the stories of bravery and sacrifice , from the unwavering support of friends , neighbors , and even strangers . & rdquo;IDSF CEO Lt . - Col . ( res . ) Yaron Buskila , who served in the Gaza war , described the chaos he witnessed on Oct . 7 , when people were calling him for help . Beyond the tragedy and trauma of the massacre , Buskila said he had also seen images of victory . He recalled the scores of cars and buses carrying thousands of reservists headed south to answer the call to arms , as well as people coming from all over the world to donate food and volunteer with the soldiers . & ldquo;We are a generation of victory , & rdquo ; he said.DIASPORA AFFAIRS and Combating Antisemitism Minister Amichai Chikli , speaking with Klein , discussed the challenges Israel faces in reducing Hamas&rsquo;s military capabilities and the need for sustained efforts similar to those following Operation Defensive Shield in 2002 . Chikli predicted that another two years of reduced military activity would be necessary in order to reach the desired level of security for Israel&rsquo;s South.He then turned his attention to antisemitism in the US , drawing parallels between the situation in Gaza and the need for vigilance in America . He noted that despite the increase in antisemitic incidents , the majority of Americans continue to support Israel.Chikli outlined his ministry&rsquo;s multifaceted approach to combating antisemitism . & ldquo;First of all , the main mission is to support the communities in terms of security , monitoring antisemitism , [ and ] investigating these organizations such as SJP [ Students for Justice in Palestine ] , & rdquo ; he explained.The ministry is also focused on tracing funding sources for these organizations , which often receive significant contributions from charities and states like Qatar . In addition , it supports local organizations and campus groups such as Hillel , Olami , and Chabad . Chikli mentioned the importance of delegations , such as those of the families of hostages and victims from Oct . 7 , in raising awareness and garnering support.The minister stressed the importance of continued vigilance and support for Jewish communities worldwide . He said his ministry is dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of these communities while also fostering a deeper connection to their heritage and the State of Israel.JERUSALEM MAYOR Moshe Lion commented that the current surge in antisemitism is reminiscent of Germany in the 1930s . & ldquo;Far from home , we see the terrible scenes you have experienced & ndash ; on campus , on the streets , with attacks on Jews & ndash ; like we have not seen since 1930s Germany , & rdquo ; the mayor said . & ldquo;Have no doubt & ndash ; the Jewish people are under attack . & rdquo;Lion described the difficult war that Israel is waging against its enemies . & ldquo;On our borders sit terror armies , shooting missiles on our heads . Courts and parliaments worldwide try to stop us from defending our people . & rdquo;Despite the difficulties , he said , Jerusalem is ready to face the challenges . & ldquo;We are continuing to build , across the city , for the benefit of all the communities : Jews , Muslims , Christians , and more . & rdquo;Lion also mentioned the plight of the hostages in front of some 70 of their family members who attended the event . & ldquo;In Gaza , our brothers and sisters , men , women , children and babies , are being held captive by the worst terrorists , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;We all pray to have them home with their families . & rdquo;A GROUP of 70 relatives attended the reception . Several addressed guests at the gala and described the harsh reality they have encountered since Oct . 7.On that horrific day , the Idan family was in their home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz . Hamas terrorists broke into the building , shot and killed 18-year-old Maayan , and held the family at gunpoint for hours , streaming live video from the phone of her mother , Gali , on her Facebook account . Her father , Tsachi , was taken hostage . & ldquo;I was in Tel Aviv , & rdquo ; Devorah Idan , Tsachi&rsquo;s mother , recounted on stage . & ldquo;We saw what was happening & ndash ; we watched for hours . We saw the children crying , asking the terrorists why they killed their sister . & rdquo;Eventually , Tsachi was taken away . & ldquo;For us , that day has never ended , & rdquo ; Idan said . & ldquo;We live in a perpetual nightmare . My granddaughter was killed , and my son was kidnapped . He did not get to go to her funeral . He did not get to mourn for her . I came [ here ] all the way from Israel to ask for help . & rdquo;MOSHE EMILIO LAVI , a former IDF captain from Sderot who now works as a management consultant in New York , criticized the Israeli authorities , including some of the officials attending the gala evening . Lavi&rsquo;s brother-in-law Omri Miran is being held in Gaza . & ldquo;Every time I addressed an international body or foreign government officials , I asked them to keep Hamas accountable , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;At the same time , I hold my government accountable . We know there is an Israeli proposal for an agreement on the table . On October 8 , we were promised that bringing the hostages home was the most important short-term objective of the war because time was of the essence . After that , we could tackle the challenge of destroying Hamas . & rdquo;Lavi recounted the horrors experienced by Omri , his sister Lishay , and his young nieces Roni and Alma at Kibbutz Nahal Oz at the hands of the Hamas terrorists . Lishay and the girls survived and were rescued by the IDF ; Omri was taken hostage . & ldquo;Roni will turn three in July , and all she is asking is that her father is with her for her birthday , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;She knows he already missed her mom&rsquo;s birthday and her little sister&rsquo;s first birthday . She just wants him back . & rdquo;RONEN NEUTRA described his son Omer , a 22-year-old soldier kidnapped on Oct . 7 , as the & ldquo;poster boy&rdquo ; for the American Jewish dream . & ldquo;Omer is an American kid . Growing up , he loved sports , and he was very involved with his Jewish youth movement , & rdquo ; he recalled.Neutra explained that he and his wife , who both hold dual American and Israeli citizenship and are children of Holocaust survivors , understood and supported Omer&rsquo;s desire to serve in the IDF . & ldquo;On October 6 , he called us , and he said he was expecting a quiet Shabbat after a month of very intense work , spending some 18 hours a day on his tank , & rdquo ; Neutra recounted . When the attack began , he and his comrades rushed to the border with their tanks . & ldquo;His whole team was taken , & rdquo ; Neutra said . & ldquo;Two of them were killed , and two were taken captive . & ldquo;Since then , my wife and I are fighting to bring my son and all the other hostages back , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;We feel the American authorities have been very supportive , but we are not sure about the Israeli government . Everyone should remember that redeeming captives is a central value in the Torah . I ask everyone in this room to do what they can to help bring my son and all the other hostages home . & rdquo;After the panel , all the family members of hostages attending the event went up on stage . The reception ended with the singing of & ldquo;Hatikvah . & rdquo;This article was written in cooperation with the Israel Defense and Security Forum .",a night for hope
2021-11-09 10:59:48.560,jpost,"The Beersheba District Court on Tuesday sentenced Israeli Arye Schiff to nine months of community service for shooting and killing an Israeli-Arab that broke into his car last November , Walla reported . Schiff was sentenced in a plea bargain over his role in killing Mohammad al-Atrash , who the defendant claimed had been trying to steal his car and that he therefore acted in self-defense . The plea bargain and sentencing follow his conviction in July , where the court rejected his claims of self-defense . In fact , the prosecution said security-camera footage of the incident showed that Schiff was in no danger and was not even in his car when the car thieves arrived . The prosecution had originally sought a sentence of 4-6 years in prison , but the plea deal averted that , Walla reported . Dozens had come out to the courtroom to support Schiff , including Religious Zionist MK Itamar Ben-Gvir . & nbsp ; "" Aryeh Schiff should receive a medal , not be prosecuted & ndash ; and certainly not receive a sentence of community service or prison , "" Ben-Gvir said in response to the verdict . "" The ruling sends a message to the residents of the South that they must not defend themselves , or else they will face charges and imprisonment . The huge gap between the sentence and the long prison sentence the prosecution demanded shows the racist treatment shown to Jews forced to defend themselves . "" Also coming out against the verdict & ndash ; saying that it was too lenient & ndash ; was Meretz MK Mossi Raz . "" The sentence given to Aryeh Schiff is an embarrassment , "" Raz said in a statement . & nbsp ; "" It's important for everyone to feel safe in their own homes , but we must never allow it to become normalized that citizens can take the lives of others into their hands . I can't help but think that if Schiff was an Arab , his punishment would have been far more severe . "" But others welcomed the verdict . "" After many long months of public struggle , we are glad public pressure succedded , "" the right-wing NGO Im Tirtzu said in a statement . "" There was no need at all to convict Aryeh , but at least the judge understands well that a very clear message must be conveyed that a citizen is allowed to defend himself against criminals . It will take a long time to restore the Negev's security , but at least Aryeh Schiff can have his life back . "" Clashes soon erupted outside the courtroom between Schiff's supporters and local Bedouin residents , notably when Ben-Gvir arrived . As the MK came to the court , the Bedouin residents began shouting at him , calling him a racist . & nbsp ; Ben-Gvir replied that "" We came to support and say that Aryeh Schiff is the hero of Israel , and it is time to bring order to the South , "" adding that , "" if the Police had been a deterrent in the South , Schiff would not have had to shoot the burglar . "" Other members of the Israeli Right have voiced their support of Schiff in the past . & ldquo;The indictment against you should not have been filed , and having been filed , it should be withdrawn , & rdquo ; then-public security minister Amir Ohana told Schiff in March . & ldquo;As usual , and despite conventional thinking , the problem is not the law or the wording of the law , "" he said . "" The problem is those interpreting the law . They are giving the law a restrictive interpretation until it is effectively negated , "" which is generally how the issue of self-defense is treated . "" They give themselves the power to fill up or empty the substance of a law . & rdquo ; Yonah Jeremy Bob contributed to this report .",israeli sentenced to 9 months community service for killing arab

2021-06-08 21:49:01.217,jpost,"A Bulgarian prosecutor provided detailed evidence to the Bulgarian court handling Hezbollah&rsquo;s involvement in the 2012 Burgas bus bombing which killed five Israelis and their Bulgarian-Muslim bus driver , but the court refused to accept it , The Jerusalem Post has learned . & nbsp ; Despite an official court transcript of these details and an appeal by the Israeli victims&rsquo ; lawyer Yaki Rand to convince the Bulgarian appeals court to issue convictions , including terrorism charges against Hezbollah , the Post also understands there is a high chance that Bulgaria&rsquo;s judiciary is looking to put the case to bed . & nbsp ; Throughout the trial there was a dispute about Bulgarian officials allegedly trying to charge only the individuals , while seeking to avoid angering Hezbollah by naming it in the case . & nbsp ; For years , Bulgarian prosecutors claimed that they had no evidence with which to tie the two defendants , who were eventually given life sentences in absentia , directly to Hezbollah and terrorism . & nbsp ; Yet , on September 17 , 2020 , after the full trial and conviction and only four days before the sentencing hearing , the prosecutor finally admitted on the record that there was significant evidence on the issue . & nbsp ; The prosecutor proceeded to detail the evidence into the court record , but since the conviction had already been set , the Bulgarian trial court said its hands were tied and that it could not reopen the case to charge Hezbollah and add terrorism charges . & nbsp ; Rand has asked the Bulgarian appeals court to order the case reopened in order to add the new charge raised by the prosecutors&rsquo ; late additional comments , but there are indications that the judiciary wants to be done with the case . & nbsp ; It is highly unusual for prosecutors to raise new facts and charges post-conviction , and it is still unclear why the prosecutor did not raise the evidence during the trial itself . & nbsp ; The case shook Europe to its foundations for its audacity , but left the families of the victims and Israel partially unsatisfied because Hezbollah itself was not formally indicted or convicted . & nbsp ; At a July 2019 anniversary ceremony for the victims , their families had demanded that Hezbollah itself be charged in the Bulgarian trial for committing an act of terrorism . & nbsp ; In his speech , Kobi Price , one of the family members , noted that , & ldquo;three years ago&hellip ; four years after the attack , the criminal trial opened&hellip ; In the indictment&hellip ; only two attackers&rdquo ; were charged . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We , the mourning families , ask the Government of Bulgaria to rise above narrow political considerations and to add the terror organization Hezbollah to the indictment without delay , & rdquo ; said Price . & nbsp ; Price continued , & ldquo;Without Hezbollah , there is no morality in the trial . Without Hezbollah , the trial is ineffective . Without Hezbollah , there is no justice for the murdered victims . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; He reiterated to the Post on Monday that it was unclear how much deterrence or justice could be achieved against the attackers if Hezbollah as an organization is left untouched . & nbsp ; In January 2018 , the Post exclusively disclosed that the Bulgarian state prosecution had decided not to charge Hezbollah as an organization with involvement in the 2012 bomb attack at the Burgas airport . & nbsp ; Instead , the prosecutor indicted the two men allegedly involved in the attack as if they were terrorists or even regular criminals who acted without connection to an organization . The word & ldquo;Hezbollah&rdquo ; does not appear in the indictment . & nbsp ; In addition , the indictment did not mention standard terrorism offenses such as & ldquo;acting as part of a terrorist organization&rdquo ; or connecting the murder offense to terrorism , referring instead merely to disturbing public order . & nbsp ; Sources close to the case told the Post at the time that when the Bulgarian prosecutor was confronted with these anomalies , he claimed that no one provided him with evidence demonstrating Hezbollah&rsquo;s involvement . & nbsp ; This directly contradicted evidence that came to light immediately after the attack from Bulgarian Interior Minister Tsvetan Tsvetanov naming Hezbollah as the culprit . & nbsp ; In 2013 , Tsvetanov&rsquo;s successor , Tsvetlin Yovchev , told reporters before a commemoration ceremony , & ldquo;There are clear signs that say Hezbollah is behind the Burgas bombing . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Also in 2013 , then-Bulgarian foreign minister Nikolay Mladenov and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu both confirmed the solid evidence linking Hezbollah to the Burgas attack . & nbsp ; Bulgaria&rsquo;s investigation into the Burgas bombing even led to the EU placing Hezbollah&rsquo;s armed wing on its blacklist . & nbsp ; The ruling party in Bulgaria has changed numerous times since 2012 with some observers saying politics ham-strung the trial . & nbsp ; Toby Dershowitz , senior vice president for government relations and Strategy at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , a nonpartisan think tank focused on national security , told the Post at the time of sentencing that & ldquo;Bulgaria has long known that Hezbollah was behind this horrific attack and has been clear about it . The fact that Bulgaria says it only has a mechanism to prosecute individuals , and not organizations , should not permit Hezbollah to yet again murder with impunity . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Post previously reported that Bulgaria sent extradition orders to Lebanon&rsquo;s government regarding the two Hezbollah operatives who were then charged with the act of terrorism . & nbsp ; The Lebanese-Australian Meliad Farah and Lebanese-Canadian Hassan El Hajj Hassan , who have been convicted of blowing up the tour bus in Burgas , Bulgaria , are believed to be in Lebanon . & nbsp ; There are also US court documents from other terror and Hezbollah-related cases which have confirmed that the two convicted men as well as the third attacker who died in the attack , French-Lebanese national Jacques Felipe Martin ( aka Mohammad Hassan el-Husseini ) , were connected to Hezbollah . & nbsp ; According to media reports , the two convicted murderers are alleged to have entered Bulgaria using false drivers&rsquo ; licenses printed in Lebanon . The Post sent press queries to Bulgaria @ @ @ s embassy and foreign ministry on Tuesday evening . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Benjamin Weinthal and Jerusalem Post Staff contributed to this story .",bulgarian official admitted hezbollah involvement in bus bombing

2024-06-19 18:41:11.873,jpost,"Medical personnel gathered in protest outside Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer on Wednesday morning , as scientists from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot held a strike against police violence at protests , especially against medical teams.The protest and strike followed recent incidents in which protesters were hurt.Police used & ldquo;disproportionate violence alongside illegal use of means to disperse protests , & rdquo ; protest organization Change Generation said in a statement . Police shot water cannons directly at protesters , causing some to lose consciousness and sending others to emergency rooms , it said.Dr . Tal Weissbach was injured at a protest in Jerusalem earlier this week after the spray from a water cannon hit her in the eye , even though she was clearly identifiable as a medical professional . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting that specifically I , with the bright orange [ vest ] with & lsquo;doctor&rsquo ; on the back , got a direct spray , & rdquo ; Weissbach said in a video released by protest organization Yalla Tikva . & ldquo;Is [ National Security Minister Itamar ] Ben-Gvir ordering [ police ] to harm medical professionals specifically ? & rdquo ; she asked.In response , the Israel Police said it takes seriously the & ldquo;disruption of public order and violent riot that occurred on Aza Street , & rdquo ; which included setting fires on the road , physical altercations with officers , and attacking officers , as well as trying to pass police barricades.Violent incidentsAll of this occurred after police & ldquo;allowed the freedom of protest and the coordinated parade for hours , as well as securing them , & rdquo ; the police said . & ldquo;As far as there are claims against those police who acted [ at the protest ] , they should be referred to the bodies that are authorized to handle them , as usual . & rdquo;The incident followed another one in which a doctor was dragged violently by police while providing medical treatment to a protester , said medical professional protest organization the Whitecoats.Organizers also accused the police of violence when removing protesters blocking the exit from Jerusalem on Tuesday . Protest organization Change Direction blocked the road with protesters who climbed ladders held aloft by other protesters with ropes.Footage of police clearing the protest appears to show police knocking the ladder to the road and one officer hitting a protester in the head with his fist repeatedly.One of the protesters on the ladder knocked to the ground was taken to a hospital emergency room . & ldquo;This is what a police [ force ] that is losing its way looks like , & rdquo ; said Change Direction on X , sharing a video in which police appear to pull the ladder out from under the protester . & ldquo;They are willing to risk the life of a protester to clear a road . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We did not believe that the police would be willing to knock a protester down from a height of three meters , & rdquo ; it said . & ldquo;They could have easily taken her down safely , but chose the violent way . & rdquo;In response , the police said dozens of protesters had disturbed public order and endangered themselves by climbing ladders while blocking the main access road to Shaare Zedek Medical Center and a main artery out of the city . & ldquo;When forces arrived , an order was given to them to disperse by the police commander on site , & rdquo ; the police said . & ldquo;After they did not heed this , police began pushing those disturbing the public order toward the sidewalk to try to open the road . & rdquo;Protest organizations cited additional incidents this week in which protesters were harmed by the police or prevented from receiving medical treatment . The Whitecoat organization said a man&rsquo;s leg was broken after a water cannon stream threw him into a wall.Many of the incidents occurred this week during what protest organizations are calling an escalation of actions taken by them to bring back the hostages or to replace the government.On Monday and Tuesday , there were large rallies at the Knesset . The rally on Monday was attended by an estimated 150,000 people , according to protest organizers . There were also protests and strikes held at high schools throughout the country , and protests are scheduled to take place in the North and South . Protest convoys are also scheduled for this week , the protest organizers said.Israel Police Insp . - Gen . Kobi Shabtai on Wednesday addressed the public&rsquo;s confidence in and the role of the police , as well as accusations of the politicization of police , at a conference at Tel Aviv University . & ldquo;When a police officer exercises authority toward a citizen , he must see the law , and only the law , before his eyes , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;The citizen must know that the policeman standing in front of him represents the law only and is certainly not acting on behalf of one minister or another . & rdquo ; & ldquo;The police in a democratic country must be free , with absolutely no politics , & rdquo ; Shabtai said . & ldquo;It must remain autonomous & ndash ; free of any political bias , one way or another . This is the only way to guarantee police independence . & rdquo ; & ldquo;The clear boundaries between the political echelon and the enforcing entity are cracking , and I fear what might happen if they are completely erased , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;The only way to avoid this is to maintain the clear separation between the political echelon and the law-enforcing entity . & rdquo ; & ldquo;During my tenure as police commissioner , I worked under three ministers , & rdquo ; Shabtai said . & ldquo;Naturally , every minister has a different professional outlook . Unfortunately , especially in the past year , the current minister&rsquo;s attempts to blatantly violate the required balance have been multiplying . There are many examples of this . Don&rsquo;t make the mistake of regarding the last event as an issue that has only come up in the last month . & rdquo ;",medical personnel protest excessive police violence against demonstrators
2024-06-09 11:12:36.050,jpost,"As a global innovation powerhouse , Israel is actively integrating cutting-edge artificial intelligence ( AI ) technologies across all facets of society , recognizing the vital importance of these advancements . & ldquo;AI will lead to unimaginable transformations at all levels and impact every aspect of our lives and the lives of future generations . This is the next industrial revolution , & rdquo ; stated President Isaac Herzog.But does this avant-garde spirit extend to the creative realm , where generative art offers a captivating glimpse into the fusion of human ingenuity and machine intelligence ? On the screen , digital dreams come alive with lush vegetation , ephemeral flowers , and flowing water.This is the AI-created world of & ldquo;Botanic Reverie&rdquo ; by Ronen Tanchum , an Israeli artist working at the forefront of technology . & ldquo;My aim is for audiences to feel my artwork and engage with it on a deep emotional level , & rdquo ; says Ronen.Inspired by nature , he uses generative algorithms to explore new aesthetic territories that exist on the boundary between the natural and the imagined . AI allows us to take a fresh look at familiar images , revealing unexpected facets of beauty . & ldquo;My work pulsates with themes of synthetic nature , blooming phenomena , and digital-human synchrony , exploring the human-machine-environment relationship , & rdquo ; Tanchum said.Contemporary artists are increasingly experimenting with generative techniques , bringing their boldest creative ideas to life . But how does this art of the future work ? Algorithms trained on vast datasets can create images , videos , and even music in response to textual prompts or visual examples . Utilizing complex mathematical models , neural networks identify patterns and generate content that aligns with user-defined parameters . Then , with additional commands , humans edit the generated image until the desired result is achieved . In this process , the artist becomes a kind of conductor , guiding the machine&rsquo;s & ldquo;creative&rdquo ; efforts.London-based Israeli photographer Ori Gersht demonstrates how AI can expand the expressive possibilities of traditional media in his project & ldquo;Fields & amp ; Visions & amp ; ( Another World ) . & rdquo ; When processing his own photographs , the artist invites the neural network to reinterpret and literally & ldquo;build upon&rdquo ; the original images & ndash ; now , they balance on the edge of photography and digital painting . & ldquo;The combination of the precise trace of the optical lens in harmony with the computerized interpretation of artificial intelligence captures a shift in our concept of reality , as these photographs are no longer a faithful depiction of the physical subject matter , & rdquo ; comments Gersht.With this experiment , the artist transforms the very nature of photography , leading the viewer into a space of imagination.The ethical ramifications of AI artOf course , it&rsquo;s not so straightforward . In Israel , as around the world , there is an extensive public discussion surrounding generative art . It&rsquo;s questionable whether it can be considered genuine art if a substantial portion of the work is done by a machine rather than a human.While diversity of approaches and freedom of expression are hallmarks of Israeli art & ndash ; just as they are of its society as a whole & ndash ; a majority of Israeli artists continue to work successfully with traditional fine art materials.Guy Yanai , an Israeli painter well-established on the international art scene , told The Jerusalem Post that he does not use AI tools in his art . At the same time , he notes that every industrial revolution has a beneficial impact on the evolution of art , pushing the boundaries of creative exploration and opening up new dimensions of creativity.Experts also point out that generative art challenges the established understanding of the creative process and the very concept of an artwork . & ldquo;I view generative art as a new method that may complement other contemporary as well as traditional practices , & rdquo ; Irena Gordon , chief curator of The Petah Tikva Museum said . & ldquo;While it is exciting as a starting point , in the end it is up to the artist to use it to create good and meaningful art . & rdquo;The integration of AI into the artistic sphere raises a number of important ethical and legal questions.Who is the author of a work created by an algorithm ? How do we assess the authenticity and value of such art ? Particularly heated discussions revolve around copyright for generative content and privacy issues when algorithms process personal data . Israel&rsquo;s recently adopted & ldquo;Responsible Innovation&rdquo ; policy for AI regulation , aimed at finding a balance between technological progress , ethical norms , and public interests , is intended to serve as a guide for the integration of AI , including in the creative industries . & ldquo;The revolutionary impact of AI technologies is yielding constant improvements in the quality of life for Israel&rsquo;s citizens in countless fields . However , along with the numerous benefits , there are also many risks . We must ensure that the human remains at the center of AI development , & rdquo ; said Innovation , Science and Technology Minister Ofir Akunis.However , it would be incorrect to claim that AI has completely and suddenly taken over art in Israel . Rather , it has complemented the extensive list of tools in the arsenal of contemporary artists.Digital art in Israel encompasses a wide range of technologies , demonstrating the openness of local artists to innovation and experimentation , from 3D modeling , VR , and AR to generative graphics , animation , and more . These media often intersect and overlap in the practice of artists , creating complex artistic statements in the language of contemporary techno-culture.This is the language in which Ruth Patir , representing Israel at this year&rsquo;s Venice Biennale , also expresses herself . Her project & ldquo ; ( M)otherland&rdquo ; masterfully combines documentary narrative with advanced computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) technologies . In her work , the artist uses 3D animation to convey her ideas to a digital-age audience in a language most understandable to them . & ldquo;For me , creating works that expand the vocabulary of the digital asset has become something I was really eager to fight for , & rdquo ; Patir said , noting , & ldquo;My practice doesn&rsquo;t focus on technology , it is only a facade of whatever is the contemporary moment we are living . & rdquo;Creative experiments with technology are also resonating in the local art market . Galleries and collectors , primarily of the younger generation , are showing increasing interest in new media.The first auction sales of NFT works by Israeli artists took place in 2022 at Tiroche auctions in Herzliya , with lots selling for record amounts for this segment , reaching the upper estimates . Sales of digital art on the secondary market indicate the successful integration of this genre into the commercial context.Leading cultural institutions in Israel are gradually including generative art along with other digital art in their exhibition and educational programs . However , it should be noted that these are still only tentative attempts , and truly large-scale exhibition projects exploring the theme of AI are still ahead for Israelis.It is equally crucial to discuss the challenges . Vladimir Opredelenov , a leading expert on digitalization for creative industries , warned The Jerusalem Post about the risks of falling behind technological progress : & ldquo;Cultural institutions need to change their mindset and implement innovative solutions to avoid finding themselves in a kind of & lsquo;blackout . & rsquo ; If they do not become part of the global digital ecosystem , they risk losing relevance and audience in the era of intelligent machines . Museums must actively study and apply AI technologies in their work & ndash ; from curating and research to collection management and visitor engagement . & rdquo;Moreover , the integration of AI into artistic practice requires art professionals to continually improve their digital literacy and master new technological tools.To effectively leverage the capabilities of AI for creativity , analysis , curating , and audience engagement , employees of museums , galleries , and other cultural institutions need to actively develop digital competencies , and stay up-to-date with the latest technology trends.AI also opens up previously unseen opportunities , particularly in the realm of preserving historical memory and cultural heritage . Algorithms can efficiently analyze vast amounts of digitized archival data , systematize it , extract valuable information , and even aid in reconstructing lost artifacts.At Yad Vashem Museum , AI technologies are used to process millions of documents , identify Holocaust victims , and create installations that immerse visitors in the context of historical events . & ldquo;AI is not just another technological trend , it is a fundamental shift that will affect every aspect of our lives , & rdquo ; Leading world expert in AI and co-founder of Navan Ilan Twig said . & ldquo;This technology has already firmly entered our lives and will only develop further . It is important for the art community to embrace these changes and learn to harness the potential of AI in the most productive way . & rdquo ;",when art meets ai : israel's journey into generative art
2023-11-11 21:52:51.570,jpost,"CNN hired a photojournalist who just three days before posted videos and photos of himself inside Israel during the Hamas massacre , including with an Israeli tank and a room of bloody , dead bodies.Gaza photojournalist Hassan Eslaiah crossed into Israel on October 7 to document the Hamas massacre of more than 1,200 Israelis . His photos from the scene appeared on several international news outlets , including The Associated Press , the Jerusalem-based watchdog HonestReporting revealed last week . & nbsp;CNN had also hired Eslaiah.The watchdog&rsquo;s story sparked a series of questions and international outcry , ultimately leading to his being let go from the two institutions . & nbsp;However , CNN said in a statement last week that their working relationship with the freelancer began after the October 7 terrorist attacks on Israel , on October 10 . It also noted that despite its decision to stop working with Eslaiah , it did not have & ldquo;any reason to doubt the journalistic accuracy of the work he has done for us , & rdquo ; as reported by Ynet and confirmed by The Jerusalem Post . & nbsp;The Post confirmed that Eslaiah was not fired for his work on the 7th but for a separate but related concern.It was unclear if CNN knew about Eslaiah&rsquo;s posts on Telegram before offering him work . & nbsp;CNN told the Post it will not be commenting further on the matter.Crossing the line : Did a photojournalist support the massacre of Israelis?The issue goes beyond issues of accuracy or bias but is more about the lines that get crossed when a photojournalist appears to act with delight in response to witnessing the killing of civilians , while working for a major news outlet.HonestReporting showed a screenshot of a now-removed post of the photojournalist on X standing in front of the Israeli tank without a press vest or helmet . The tweet read , & ldquo;Live from inside the Gaza Strip settlements . & rdquo ; A similar image still appears on his Telegram page.HonestReporting also published a separate image from well before the massacre showing Eslaiah buddying up with Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.However , by scrolling through Eslaiah&rsquo;s personal Telegram channel , the Post has found that Eslaiah posted much more than a tank on the 7th , including items that indicate that not only did he likely know about the planned massacre before it began at around 6:30 a.m . , but that he supported the deaths of the innocent Israelis he watched being murdered.Eslaiah&rsquo;s first post on October 7 was at 5:59 a.m . : & ldquo;We wake up to the great gifts of God , & rdquo ; he posted , according to a translation by ChatGPT . & ldquo;The spirit has returned , and our blessings have increased . & rdquo;Within half an hour , he is posting about the rockets being launched at Israel and the sounds of the Iron Dome intercepting them over Khan Yunis . Then , between 6:55 a.m . and 8:30 a.m . , he posts multiple variations : & ldquo;To follow the latest news moment by moment , follow me on my media platforms . & rdquo;At 8:29 a.m . , he appears & ldquo;live from inside the settlements near the Gaza Strip&rdquo ; with a picture of a burning tank in the background.At 8:36 a.m . , after witnessing nearly 10 minutes of the massacre , he posts images from the scene with a verse from the Koran : & ldquo ; And on that day , the believers will rejoice in the victory of Allah&rdquo ; and the hashtag & ldquo ; # AqsaFlood . & rdquo;At 9:25 a.m . , the most gruesome of posts is revealed : a video with his watermark : & ldquo;Filmed by Hassan Eslaiah&rdquo ; in the center , depicting a room full of dead , bloody bodies . & nbsp;This particular video does not appear to have been published anywhere else . In the background , you hear a calm voice that sounds like his from other videos , and is spoken in his Arabic dialect , stating the following : & ldquo ; [ Animal ] carcasses , carcasses . God is great . This is the path to Jerusalem . & rdquo;There is another video at 9:49 a.m . of his standing in front of burning Jewish homes as terrorists run by . And a final video one minute later of his leaving Israel on the back of someone&rsquo;s motorbike . & nbsp;Is this the kind of photojournalist that major news outlets should be hiring ? What kind of vetting process should be required before hiring someone in a foreign country?Perhaps these are the questions that all international outlets should now be asking themselves .",crossing the lines of integrity with a hamas-praising photojournalist - analysis
2024-04-26 22:09:56.327,jpost,"Hanan Savyon and Guy Amir , the duo behind the TV series Asfur and the megahit Israeli movies Maktub and Forgiveness , are back on the small screen with Bros , Netflix&rsquo;s first original Hebrew-language series , which recycles the Jerusalemite schlubby bromance shtick that has worked for them all these years.If you liked their earlier work , you&rsquo;ll have fun with this , and if you didn&rsquo;t , well , you&rsquo;re probably not their target audience anyway . For once , there are English subtitles available , which will make it easier for many English-speakers in Israel to give it a try . & nbsp;It won&rsquo;t shock anyone to hear that they play two friends who run a bar in the Mahaneh Yehuda market called Pin-Younis , with Savyon as the hard-partying Pini , whose wife can&rsquo;t get pregnant ( which a doctor suggests is a problem caused by Pini&rsquo;s drug use ) , and Amir as Niso , his BFF and business partner , whose girlfriend , Rotem ( Yael Sztulman ) , works at the bar.The main plot is about how they head to Krakow to support their favorite soccer team & ndash ; Beitar Jerusalem , as you might have guessed & ndash ; as it competes against a Polish team . Subplots include a possible cancer diagnosis , Niso&rsquo;s problems with Rotem , and a group of Tel Aviv hipsters who plan to open a rival establishment and then try to buy their bar . & nbsp;Their Poland adventure takes up several episodes and allows them to delve a bit into the little-known history of how Mizrahim were victims in the Holocaust.The Poland episodes also feature all kinds of action , including when they get chased by a group of neo-Nazis and even more dire predicaments . Like a lot of Israeli comedies , the series mixes sentimental and melodramatic storylines with the slapstick . & nbsp;One thought that occurred to me watching it is that while most Beitar fans are just fans , there is a racist element to the team&rsquo;s fan base that you wouldn&rsquo;t guess at from its portrayal here . The series doesn&rsquo;t make it clear that the characters distance themselves from the kinds of fans who have actually unfurled & ldquo;Forever Pure&rdquo ; banners at the team&rsquo;s matches & ndash ; & ldquo;Forever Pure&rdquo ; is the title of an excellent documentary about these fans & ndash ; to show their opposition to the team hiring Arab players . These fans have resorted to violence to show their opposition to having Arabs and Muslims of all nationalities join the team . & nbsp;But the heart of the series is Pini and Niso&rsquo;s friendship , and Savyon and Amir , who have been working together for decades , really project the closeness of longtime friends and , like so many comic actors , rise to the occasion when there is an emotional moment . Their self-deprecating likability lifts this series above its often formulaic script , and if you stick with it , it will be because you enjoy spending time in their company . & nbsp;What else is on Israeli TV?IT&rsquo;S GOOD news for fans of vintage American sitcoms that Yes has just started a new channel called Classic Comedies , which is available on Channel 29 . It runs around the clock , and it offers comedy series from the & rsquo;70s to the & rsquo;90s . It features All in the Family , which many consider the greatest sitcom of all time , which was about the unrepentant racist Archie Bunker.This series was created by television great Norman Lear , and was more or less the first time that a network television comedy dealt with political issues for laughs , but with a serious agenda . Lear was a liberal , and while the pugnacious hero , Bunker , charmed some , his convictions were proved wrong in episode after episode , although the series also made fun of his liberal son-in-law ( played by Rob Reiner , the son of Carl Reiner , who is now a movie director ) and his daughter ( Sally Struthers ) . Other sitcoms on the channel include Mad About You , with Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt ( who went on to win a Best Actress Oscar for As Good As It Gets ) , Cheers ( considered one of the best ensemble casts of all times ) , Happy Days ( the Fonz ! ) , Who&rsquo;s the Boss ? and The Love Boat.If Yes programmers are reading this , I&rsquo;d like to request that they add The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Taxi , two series created by James L . Brooks that I would be very happy to see at 2 a.m . when I can&rsquo;t sleep.ONE OF the big issues in the Hollywood writers strike was the use of AI to write screenplays , because the Hollywood scribes feared they would be replaced . But when you watch a lot of the rom-coms and light entertainment on Netflix and other platforms these days , it&rsquo;s hard to believe that they weren&rsquo;t written by robots , and not especially well-programmed robots.That doesn&rsquo;t mean you won&rsquo;t enjoy aspects of them ; the casts and locations are always great-looking . But to say that there are no surprises would be an understatement . & nbsp;A case in point is the new Spanish movie on Netflix , Love , Divided . It&rsquo;s about a nerdy but gorgeous app designer who works out of his apartment , which shares a paper-thin wall with the apartment that a recently dumped , awkward but gorgeous pianist moves into . He has a deadline to get the app ready and must work all the time , while she is practicing for a special audition.If you&rsquo;ve seen a movie or two , you could easily write a script right now that would be almost identical to the actual film.LOOKING FOR something a little more interesting , I found I&rsquo;ll See You in My Dreams , a movie that recently joined the Netflix lineup and which stars Blythe Danner ( who is probably best known these days for being Gwyneth Paltrow&rsquo;s mother , but who has had a very interesting career of her own ) as Carol , a lonely widow who steps back into the dating pool after many years alone . While it might sound like a typical rom-com , it&rsquo;s much more thoughtful and even a bit downbeat.Carol , a retired singer and teacher and the mother of an adult daughter who lives far away , wakes up every morning , waters her plants , exercises , sees her girlfriends ( a great group played by Rhea Perlman , Mary Kay Place , and June Squibb ) , and plays golf , but she feels something is missing in her life ; and after her beloved dog dies , she begins dating.Sam Elliott , who played the wise old cowboy in The Big Lebowski , is her love interest , and his character is similarly adrift.But the story isn&rsquo;t all straight lines and big laughs , ending with a clinch . One element that sets it apart is a storyline where she befriends her pool cleaner , a young man who aspires to write songs and feels stuck , and to whom she can open up in a way she can&rsquo;t with her old friends.The pool cleaner is played by Martin Starr , whom you may know as Gilfoyle , the Satan-worshiping programmer in Silicon Valley . While I loved him in that series , I actually didn&rsquo;t recognize him here , and without his strange Gilfoyle hairstyle , he is a handsome leading man type , with an edge . & nbsp;While I watched this movie , I started out envying the characters because they were living their lives in a world that was so peaceful , without war or terrorism or the thousands of other things that make life in Israel challenging . But by the end I realized that , to quote a line from the Norwegian movie 1001 Grams , & ldquo;Life&rsquo;s heaviest burden is having nothing to carry . & rdquo;MUCH IS coming up soon in May , including a number of movies and series to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day , notably the series The Tattooist of Auschwitz , which stars Harvey Keitel in an adaptation of the book of the same name.There will be much more programming devoted to marking this day , including documentaries , series , and feature films , as well as movies devoted to Remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israel&rsquo;s Wars and Independence Day , which will be filled with deeper sorrow this year , since the losses of October 7 and the subsequent war .","check out ' bros , ' netflix's first hebrew-original series"

The Petah Tikva native also played for the Israel National Team , making 34 appearances , before moving into coaching where he began to earn his stripes in the Maccabi Tel Aviv youth department in 2003.His first full time head coaching job was with Kiryat Shmona , where he helped the team earn promotion from the Leumit League and then finished in third place in Premier Leauge action to earn a place in UEFA Cup play.After a very short stint with Maccabi Tel Aviv in 2008 it was back to Kiryat Shmona for a trio of seasons where he won a pair of Toto Cups . Most notable as well as the shocking 2011-2012 League championship with K8 that became an international story of success for a small team finding a way to finish atop the table against clubs with budgets much higher than the northerners.The next season , Ben Shimon went abroad to lead AEK Larnaca in Cyprus and then returned back to Israel to head up Hapoel Tel Aviv , Maccabi Petah Tikva and Beitar Jerusalem before taking over the Cyprus National Team post where he plied his trade between 2017-2020.Ashdod for three seasons and then another stop back at Larnaca was on tap before being appointed as the head coach of the Israel National Team.Ahead of the two upcoming matches , which for Hungary will be a tune-up for the UEFA European Championship , Ben Shimon was unveiled as the new bench boss and spoke about his vision for the&nbsp;blue-and-white as he begins to mold the squad to his liking . ' Israel National Team is a mission ' & nbsp ; & ldquo;The Israel National Team is not just another stop for me & ndash ; it&rsquo;s a mission , and I will go into every working day treating it as the most important day . & ldquo;Being a national team player is how one conducts himself off and on the field , both when we are together as a team and when we are not . Every time we are together is of great importance to me . Every game will be treated the same , no more or no less important . & nbsp;This is an opportunity for everyone who is around the team to ask what they can do differently . We are in a complex period of time and I will try my utmost to connect this team to the people of Israel . & rdquo;Ben Shimon spoke about Barak Bachar , who had been a leading candidate for the position but decided to head back to Maccabi Haifa after a short and disappointing run with Red Star Belgrade . & ldquo;Coaches who were deserving of this position were in competition for it and I don&rsquo;t feel second to anyone , no matter what is written and what people may say . I was also a candidate in other campaigns , I feel very secure in my place . & ldquo;Every place that I&rsquo;ve been in my life there was also a clash between my head and my heart and I went with my gut feeling . This is the right place for me to be . I believe in my abilities to do different things than what was done in the past . I believe in this generation of players and I have arrived at the right stage in my life to coach the Israel National Team , which is a big challenge . I will have to bring all the experience and what I have gained in life into the challenge that I am entering into today with great faith . & rdquo;Ben Shimon will lead the team in the upcoming Nations League campaign , where the opponents will be European heavyweights France , Italy and Belgium . & ldquo;I am not going to deny that the main goal is Euro 2028 , but we will have a competitive team in every game . Each game will give us a little more as to what we can do and accomplish . & ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to pass up these two years . I&rsquo;m going to work very hard to produce a DNA of winners and I need to create a team that will connect with the people in this campaign . We will not give up any game . That&rsquo;s the beauty of sports & ndash ; you don&rsquo;t know what the outcome will be at the end . We will come into these games with complete faith that we can win . & rdquo;Ben Shimon added that he is still working to put together his group of assistants . & ldquo;I believe that in the next week or so the balance of the staff will be appointed and if we only rely on the times we get together for games our philosophy won&rsquo;t work . We have to work on a daily basis , work hard and convince the players that this is what it takes to advance to a big tournament . & ldquo;In order to achieve different results , we must change . My predecessors did good things and we need to learn from that . I am a big believer in seeing what teams similar to ours have done and those that have broken glass ceilings . I am coming into this with complete faith in both the local product and the Israeli player . & rdquo;The new coach also spoke about what type of players that he will want to include in his squad as well as how he will work with them to get the best out of the squad . & ldquo;I will have to shape the nature of my work in front of the players . I prefer players with European experience , but the team is open to everyone . & rdquo;Last campaign saw the ugly saga of Eran Zahavi&rsquo;s hotel room assignment , which caused a stir at the time . & ldquo;Everyone comes in with their own agenda , & rdquo ; Ben Shimon said . & ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sit down and decide how we want things to look . I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s too complicated , we need to create an environment for the players to succeed . I have a personal connection with each player . I have a wonderful relationship with Eran and I also spoke with [ Miguel ] Vitor . I believe that everything will be&nbsp;considered individually , but there is no doubt that the team is going through a process . & rdquo;Ben Shimon also commented on the path he took to become the head coach . & ldquo;When I was a player , I didn&rsquo;t think I would become a coach . All the stations I went through come back to me . While I am an emotional person , I am less concerned with the past and I am not very nostalgic . All this is nice , but from here on it is a matter of seeing what we can do to succeed . & rdquo ;",ben shimon stoked for blue-and-white debut

The group also made chocolates for evacuated families.Additionally , the women prepared meals for IDF soldiers , and visited Sderot and kibbutzim on Israel&rsquo;s southern border , where they witnessed what remains of the October 7 massacre . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;The mothers on this trip saw Israel&rsquo;s stories from their own eyes and heard them from their own ears and now it's the time to act , & rdquo ; said Momentum Founding Director Lori Palatnik . & ldquo;We hope every participant takes the call of & lsquo;Hineni&rsquo ; - to show up - and they each go back to their homes to show up for their Israeli sisters who have suffered so much . It is our hope that they come out of this experience forever changed . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; "" The purpose of the mission is to provide opportunities for women in the Diaspora to meaningfully contribute to Israeli society while they&rsquo;re here and identify with their struggles . After hearing from families of hostages , soldiers , farmers and Israeli mothers we hope our participants will emerge from this experience with a new sense of understanding about what Israelis are going through right now . And , collectively , when the Diaspora and Israel come together , we can demonstrate the power of unity , & rdquo ; Palatnik added.Trip participant Erica Markovitz , from Detroit , said , & ldquo;I had two friends at the Nova Festival . One of them is still a hostage . I&rsquo;m here in Israel to bear witness and send a message home and to keep their stories alive . & rdquo ;",jewish mothers fly to israel to offer support in the wake of october 7
2021-04-08 21:07:15.657,jpost,"Can the US offer financial assistance to the Palestinians even while the Palestinian Authority pays monthly stipends to terrorists and their families ? & nbsp ; The question was raised by reporters and pundits on Wednesday when the US announced it planned to restore humanitarian and security assistance to the Palestinians , as part of an overall financial package of $ 290 million . & nbsp ; Former US president Donald Trump cut all funding to the Palestinians , which had soared close to $ 600 million annually under the Obama administration . & nbsp ; Trump also put in place legislation to hold the PA financially accountable for terror activity and to halt its practice of terror stipends , known as & ldquo;pay-for-slay . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; A reporter referenced that legislation when quizzing US State Department spokesman Ned Price on how the Biden administration could legally restore funding . & nbsp ; & ldquo;US laws & ndash ; there&rsquo;s several of them & ndash ; say that the US cannot provide money to the Palestinian Authority , & rdquo ; the reporter stated . & nbsp ; Price assured him that the funding was & ldquo;absolutely consistent with relevant US law . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Here are five things to know about US funding to Palestinians and PA terror payments : & nbsp ; PA&rsquo;s pay-for-slay The Palestinian Authority provides monthly stipends to the families of terrorists who are killed while engaging in acts of terrorism , and to those jailed for terrorist acts or on suspicion of terrorist activity . & nbsp ; It is estimated that the PA spends at least NIS 500 million annually on these stipends , with higher payments going to those whose crimes were more severe and who have longer jail sentences . & nbsp ; Proponents of & ldquo;pay-for-slay&rdquo ; brand the payments as a kind of social welfare system , particularly in light of Israel&rsquo;s practice of administrative detentions in which security prisoners can be held without charges . & nbsp ; Opponents have argued that if this were the case , payments would be based on need rather than the severity of the crime . & nbsp ; Taylor Force Act US military veteran Taylor Force was stabbed to death in March 2016 , while in Israel for a business program , near the beach in Tel Aviv by a Palestinian . Two years later the US Congress passed legislation prohibiting direct assistance to the PA , to prevent terror payments based on US funds going to anyone associated with Force&rsquo;s death . & nbsp ; The Biden administration intends to uphold that legislation , including not paying PA loans . & nbsp ; The Anti-Terror Clarification Act The anti-terror clarification act of 2018 allowed the Palestinian Authority to be financially liable should it be found guilty in US courts of supporting terror activity . The legislation was broadly written so that even humanitarian assistance to non-governmental Palestinian organizations , peace-building funding or scholarship funding puts the PA in a position of liability . & nbsp ; The PA notified the US in 2019 that it would not accept any funding , including humanitarian assistance , over fear of judicial liability . Subsequent Congressional legislation amended the ATCA to allow financial assistance to the Palestinian people , but leaving intact judicial liability issues for direct funding to the PA and the Palestine Liberation Organization . & nbsp ; PA Security Forces The US-trained Palestinian security forces , which cooperate with the IDF , are considered an essential pillar of stability in the West Bank . Funding for those forces , which had amounted to $ 60 million annually , was exempt under the Taylor Force Act . & nbsp ; Joel Braunold , managing director of the S . Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace , said that the Taylor Force Act was specifically intended to target the Economic Support Funds account that drew on & ldquo;bilateral economic assistance and humanitarian traditional programs in the West Bank and Gaza . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; But it was not intended to & ldquo;affect security assistance that comes from the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement account ( INLE ) , not covered by Taylor Force requirements . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Funding for the security forces , however , was impacted by the ATCT , a problem corrected by amendments to that legislation . The Biden administration has now resumed funding to the PA security forces . & nbsp ; UNRWA The majority of US funding to the Palestinians had always gone through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees , amounting to an annual grant of over $ 350 million . The US was the single largest donor to UNRWA . & nbsp ; The Trump administration&rsquo;s decision in 2018 to cut funding to UNRWA was not based on prohibitions in the ATCT or the Taylor Force Act . There was no legal impediment to continued US funding to UNRWA , which services 5.7 million Palestinian refugees in east Jerusalem , Gaza , the West Bank , Lebanon , Jordan and Syria . & nbsp ; The Trump administration made a policy decision not to support the organization because it believed that Palestinians could be better served by other organizations . It agreed with Israel that UNRWA&rsquo;s definition of who is a Palestinian refugee was problematic , and that the organization was inefficient and promoted incitement against Israel . & nbsp ; The Biden administration has now made a policy decision to support UNRWA , with an initial grant of $ 150 million .",5 things to know about us funding to palestinians and terror payments
2023-10-22 15:44:16.360,jpost,"Israel should not re-occupy the Gaza Strip , and should make sure Palestinians still rule the area , Commanders for Israel&rsquo;s Security ( CIS ) and other former top defense officials said in its recommendations for how Israel should handle Gaza post-toppling Hamas.In contrast , several officials familiar with government deliberations on the issues are far more circumspect about sharing their views , and about whether a serious strategy can be framed , before the outcome of the ground invasion ( which continues to be delayed ) becomes clearer.According to the senior former security officials , & ldquo;The war must end decisively for Israel , in a manner which will restore Israel&rsquo;s standing and enhance deterrence . Towards this end , diplomatic , economic and other tools of statecraft should be pursued alongside the military campaign . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Israel has no intention of occupying the Gaza Strip and will not reassume responsibility for it . The Gaza Strip must be ruled by a Palestinian government with the assistance of international entities and a direct connection to the Palestinian government in the West Bank , & rdquo ; said CIS.Further , CIS said , & ldquo;Israel should relinquish control of the territory captured during the operation as quickly as possible and should not repeat the scenario of becoming mired in the Lebanese quagmire . This imperative does not include territory captured for the purpose of widening the buffer zone . & rdquo;Questions about this new Palestinian regime in GazaCIS&rsquo;s strategy paper is one of the most detailed to date on the issue by top officials , though it still leaves many open questions : What form will a new Palestinian regime in Gaza take ? How much will the Palestinian Authority dominate this regime versus local representatives from Gaza ? Given Hamas&rsquo;s success at eliminating organized internal opposition , how will Gaza have local representatives if none of the class of Hamas , rulers for the last 15 years , will be allowed in the new regime ? & nbsp;Also : Why will this new Palestinian government , with whatever unidentified international assistance , succeed in keeping Hamas down where the PA , UNFIL , and other international peacekeeping groups have failed in the past to keep down determined local violent groups?Finally , CIS said to avoid the Israeli model of the early 1980s of interfering with who ran Lebanon , but suggested an unidentified larger security zone . This larger security zone idea is another large piece of what kept Israel mired deep in the & ldquo;Lebanese quagmire&rdquo ; for almost another 20 years.A top former intelligence official separate from this group gave a wider number of potential choices of what could happen to Gaza post Hamas . & ldquo;We need to take apart Hamas , and any future ruler of Gaza cannot bring back the military power . All of Oslo was based on the paradigm of demilitarization . We dropped this requirement for Hamas . We need to hand off Gaza to Egypt , or the Palestinian Authority , Jordan , or the UAE , & rdquo ; said the former top intelligence official.However , he added , & ldquo;Maybe no one will want to take it . & rdquo;Despite this dilemma , he stated , & ldquo;that even in the worst case , it would take years for some other bad actor to achieve the militarization levels of Hamas . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Hamas had 15 years for its military buildup . And it is not just that we did not disrupt their militarization . [ Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu even helped Hamas with funding and materials . The materials were for building , but they were used for making rockets and tunnels . It does not matter who rules Gaza , we cannot let them rebuild their military power . & rdquo;This official was possibly being the most blatantly honest of all , recognizing that there may be no perfect solution that can prevent Hamas from at some point regaining control of Gaza.However , he recognized that even if Hamas returned in the worst case scenario , this & nbsp;would take time , and he was pointing out that that time itself and extra time afterward to rebuild military power , would give a much longer break from large rounds of fighting with Gaza.Former national security council chief from 2017-2021 Meir Ben Shabbat said using overwhelming force against Hamas to defeat it quickly and comprehensively is the only thing Israel should be thinking about at this stage . & ldquo;Israel is exempt from worrying what will happen in Gaza after the war . It must overthrow Hamas and destroy its military capabilities , and let the chips fall where they may , & rdquo ; said Ben Shabbat , who now also heads Misgav : The Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy.Ben Shabbat appears to be concerned that the invasion itself continues to be delayed and to look more surgical and less aggressive than Netanyahu and other officials&rsquo ; public statements would suggest.Regarding the multiple officials familiar with government debates on the issue , one noted that Israel may not have a dominant role in deciding who to hand Gaza to , even if it militarily defeats the Gaza group.In other words , once Israel refuses to hold on to Gaza itself , and asks for international help , Jerusalem may be stuck with arrangements sponsored by the UN , the US , or some other mix of powers.Others implied that the invasion itself was so large , and the guerilla war afterward so unclear and vague , that it was nearly impossible to plan post-war issues until the shape of the war itself eventually becomes clearer . & nbsp ;",gaza must be ruled by palestinians with int'l help - ex-defense chiefs
2022-09-22 15:22:20.210,jpost,"Palestinians on Thursday expressed anger over reports that British Prime Minister Liz Truss was studying relocating her country&rsquo;s embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.Some Palestinians described the move as & ldquo;a new Balfour Declaration&rdquo ; and said it proves Britain&rsquo;s bias in favor of Israel.A Palestinian Authority official said the Palestinian leadership has not received an official statement from the British government regarding the relocation of the embassy.The official warned that such & ldquo;dangerous&rdquo ; moves would have a negative impact on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Moving the British embassy to JerusalemThe official pointed out that the reports about moving the British Embassy to Jerusalem surfaced shortly after a meeting between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Truss , who are both in New York to attend the annual United Nations General Assembly session . & ldquo;If Britain wants to play any role in the region , it must avoid taking any decision that only causes harm and aggravates tensions , & rdquo ; the official told The Jerusalem Post.Sabri Saidam , a former PA cabinet minister and senior member of the ruling Fatah faction headed by Abbas , also rejected any decision to move the British Embassy to Jerusalem.Referring to the transfer of the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem just over years ago , Saidam told the PA&rsquo;s Voice of Palestine radio station , & ldquo;Britain is not America , and it has historical obligations toward the Palestinian people . The catastrophes of the Palestinian people were based on the Balfour Declaration . & rdquo;The Fatah official said that instead of moving the embassy to Jerusalem , the British government should recognize a sovereign Palestinian state & ldquo;as a simple step to correct is historical mistake . & rdquo;Mustafa Barghouti , secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative Party , said the British prime minister belongs to the & ldquo;pro-Zionist&rdquo ; conservatives and is known for flip-flopping on her stances . & ldquo;The announcement by the British Prime Minister Liz Terrace about her intention to move her country&rsquo;s embassy to Jerusalem , is a flagrant bias towards the occupation . & rdquo;Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif QanouBarghouti claimed that Truss and her friends were trying to win the support of the Jewish community in Britain . & ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t surprised because the positions of this British government are against the interests of the Palestinian people , & rdquo ; Barghouti , a former PA presidential candidate , said in an interview with a local Palestinian radio station . & ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think they will succeed in moving the embassy because of the fierce opposition by the friends of the Palestinians in Britain . & rdquo;Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad condemned the reports about the intention to relocate the British Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem . & ldquo;The announcement by the British Prime Minister Liz Truss about her intention to move her country&rsquo;s embassy to Jerusalem is a flagrant bias toward the occupation , & rdquo ; said Hamas spokesperson Abdel Latif Qanou.He warned that the move would not give Israel any legitimacy & ldquo;over one inch of our land . & rdquo;Another Hamas official , Hazem Qassem , warned that moving the British Embassy would be considered as a new crime by Britain against the Palestinian people.Islamic Jihad senior official Mohammed Shalah accused Britain of continuing to display & ldquo;arrogance&rdquo ; against the Palestinians . & ldquo;We are not surprised by what Britain is doing in light of the ongoing Arab and Islamic silence , & rdquo ; said Shalah . & ldquo;We blame the Arab and Islamic countries that are supposed to support Jerusalem . & rdquo;Another PIJ official , Tareq Salmi , warned that the alleged British plan would spark the anger of the Arabs and Muslims . He denounced the reported plan as a & ldquo;hideous colonial aggression&rdquo ; against the Palestinians , adding , & ldquo;Britain is directly responsible for the tragedy of the Palestinian people . & rdquo ;",palestinians warn against moving british embassy to jerusalem

In response , the entire air force is scrambled to participate in a broad offensive against Lebanon , including attacks against infrastructure such as bridges , power plants and airports spanning 24 hours . That scenario was the focus of an IDF exercise that began on Sunday morning and ended on Tuesday at noon . & nbsp ; During the drill , the IAF proved its ability to strike at 3,000 Hezbollah targets within a 24-hour period . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We practiced defending Israel&rsquo;s skies against cruise missiles and operating our active [ aerial ] defense system against the rockets that they will want to use to target air force bases and densely populated areas , & rdquo ; a senior IAF officer said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We practiced attacking high-value targets in quantities in a way we never did before , & rdquo ; the officer added . & ldquo;It was 24 hours with more than 3,000 targets attacked , causing severe damage to the operations of the enemy . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Despite the limitations imposed by the coronavirus crisis , about 85 % of IAF personnel participated in the exercise , which involved all branches , including technicians , ammunition officers and reservists , who were called up to participate . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; One of the main tasks simulated was achieving air superiority over Lebanon . This was achieved by destroying all elements that could threaten Israeli aircraft , including antiaircraft launchers , especially in southern Lebanon and Beirut , where Hezbollah has its headquarters . & nbsp ; Two weeks ago , Hezbollah tried to shoot down an IAF drone over Lebanon . The surface-to-air missile missed , and the drone continued its reconnaissance mission , the IDF said at the time . & nbsp ; While the drill focused on Hezbollah and Lebanon , the IAF considers the North as a single front and understands that Hezbollah also operates in Syria and that Iran is present throughout what is referred to as the & ldquo;Shi&rsquo;ite Crescent , & rdquo ; spanning Iran , Iraq , Syria and Lebanon , the senior officer said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We look even further east , but we operate there only in response to [ incidents ] , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; Lt . - Col . S . , commander of the 201st Squadron that flies the F-16I and participated in the drill , told The Jerusalem Post his unit practiced a wide range of missions , including collecting intelligence and using many types of munitions in attacking multiple targets . & nbsp ; & ldquo;This drill demonstrated a response to a mistake the other side made , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;It shows the enemy what the air force will do in response to an attack on a fighter jet . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; During the 60 hours of the exercise , the entire staff of the squadron , including pilots and technicians , practiced loading and unloading different types of munitions onto and off of their fighter jets , all of which participated in the drill , S . said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking here about lifting munitions weighing tons . . . We basically did everything we will do in a war , except actually flying to the operational area , and dropping the bombs , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; Another aspect of the exercise was getting the participants into the mood of the drill and hoping that reservists , who are considered a vital element in the air force , drop their day-to-day lives and attend . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;On Sunday morning we got the call that the drill is starting , & rdquo ; S . said . & ldquo;It caught us by surprise . We changed all our plans and started operating in war mode . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;People who planned to be with their loved ones on Valentine&rsquo;s Day had to cancel the plans , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;Our reservists who planned on going to work on Sunday and Monday had to call their bosses or their colleagues and tell them they couldn&rsquo;t come . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;But above all , it was a mental exercise , & rdquo ; S . said . & ldquo;Just after the lockdown and the uncertainty , people understood that this is what they have to do , and they attended the drill . & rdquo ;","in message to hezbollah , iaf practices striking 3,000 targets in 24 hours"
2024-05-17 12:00:22.867,jpost,"I like museums at night & ndash ; there is just something about seeing the art after most people have gone home . & nbsp;I had just gone to the first opening at the Israel Museum after the coronavirus pandemic had more or less calmed down , and it was so relaxing to walk through the empty corridors and look out the glass windows at the Valley of the Cross . The exhibit was a large , realistic painting called The Bureaucrat by Matan Ben Cnaan . It shows a group of people in a field in Israel looking pleadingly at a man with a clipboard . The artist said he copied it & ndash ; the grouping , the faces , the tense body language & ndash ; from a photo of prisoners arriving on the platform at Auschwitz.There was a panel at the event , and they had an interesting commentary about it . They seemed to have thought a bit about the same ideas the painting had raised for me : What would I have done if I had lived during the Holocaust ? How would I have protected my son Oren , who is in his 20s and has autism ? & nbsp;The audience listened intently as they [ the panel members ] spoke . It was such a Jerusalem evening , with those old couples I see at all kinds of exhibitions and events . I used to hate and envy them , especially when I would overhear them talking about their adult children who were finishing the army and going to medical school or opening hi-tech businesses and getting married and having children . I don&rsquo;t hate them anymore . It&rsquo;s harder to hate them when they&rsquo;re wearing corona masks . They look scared and creepy and childlike all at once.But it&rsquo;s not only that . I don&rsquo;t hate them anymore because things are different with Oren now . & nbsp;When the opening was over , I tried to head to the outdoor sculpture garden to wander for a few minutes in the cool air , but it was blocked off . Oren used to like going to the museum and walking in that garden before we slipped into our routine of the zoo every Saturday afternoon . & nbsp;THE LAST time I remember taking him to the museum was during the summer he turned 18 , one of our hardest times . My mother , who had become too demented to live on her own in New York , had moved in with us . I couldn&rsquo;t work as much as I had been because I was taking care of her part of the time , and to write at all , I had to hire someone to look after her & ndash ; in addition to the students I hired to help me take care of Oren in the evenings , when he often had tantrums . & nbsp;So my income was down , my expenses were up , and my mother&rsquo;s pension and savings were stuck in America and I had no one to help me get them out . The customer service employees on the phone lines would hear the desperation in my voice and put me in the automatic scammer category , denying me access to every account she had . & nbsp;My ex-husband had always said he would help care for my mother when the time came , but now he was long gone . My mother , angry that I had whisked her away from her beloved New York , was sitting on the couch all day , criticizing me , as mothers do . I had to do all my work and any exercising in my bedroom . & nbsp;We had just gone through a war with Gaza that had included missiles fired at Jerusalem . It had thrown Oren&rsquo;s school schedule out of whack ; now it was the end of the summer and he was home for 14 indescribably long days . When his repetitive questions began to bother my mother , she would start yelling at him . I could not leave them alone in the living room , even to go to the bathroom . He didn&rsquo;t react right away but later in the day , he would have violent tantrums , usually when I told him it was time for him to stop playing on the computer . & nbsp;But that wasn't the worst of itBUT THAT wasn&rsquo;t the worst of it . The worst of it was that I had stopped sleeping . & nbsp;All right , that&rsquo;s an exaggeration . I slept a little , but never more than four hours a night and usually much less . I had a sleeping-pill prescription at one point , but my doctor said it was too much , I needed to stop , and he wouldn&rsquo;t renew it . & nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t understand , though . My father had been bipolar , and I knew how it was when someone stopped sleeping & ndash ; the sloppiness and the craziness that came out . I could feel myself heading that way . & nbsp;The day we went to the Israel Museum back then , my mother was home watching tennis with my younger son , Ben . It was okay to leave them together , and I hoped my mother would never lose it with him the way she did with Oren . Ben was affected by Oren&rsquo;s tantrums more than any of us , I felt . Oren was my son ; as his mother , I had signed on for this , for better or worse . But Ben had never asked for any of this , and as Oren&rsquo;s outbursts had gotten worse , Ben had gotten more and more withdrawn and rarely came out of his room . & nbsp;Oren and I walked through the sculpture garden that summer day and stopped outside the children&rsquo;s wing . The guards are real tough asses there , and Oren&rsquo;s loud voice and jumping would instantly get him thrown out of any other part of the museum . He climbed the structure outside that kids were allowed to climb , a kind of pyramid that he lowered himself down into until only his long feet were visible.Being upside down like that seemed to calm him , and he was quiet as we walked into the children&rsquo;s wing , where a film about cities was showing , called Dies Irae . The room where it was playing was cool and empty , and we sat down . I had to Google dies irae to find out that it means & ldquo;day of rage . & rdquo ; The film showed rapidly shifting cityscapes , and Oren and I were both transfixed . & nbsp;I had brought a book with me to read during any kids&rsquo ; movie we might see there . It cheers me even now to remember that I was actually reading a book then . How could I ever have found the time and energy ? & nbsp;But it was the perfect book for me right then : The Financial Lives of the Poets by Jess Walter . It was a novel about an unemployed journalist who made disastrous real estate and career decisions and briefly tried to deal weed to help him out of the mess he was in , while coping with a cheating wife and a live-in , senile father . A different story from mine , but we shared a few things & ndash ; including insomnia . & nbsp;AT ONE point in the story , the hero read an article about chronic insomnia which said that it causes & ldquo ; & lsquo;a steep decline in neural activity which can eventually lead to severe hallucinations , delirium , manias , even psychotic breaks & ndash ; then death & ndash ; & rsquo ; Then death ? Wait . Just like that ? Shit . . . A few days without sleep and you go from slurred speech and bad decisions to . . . death ? Well , that hardly seems fair . It feels like they left out a few steps . & rdquo ; & nbsp;I had seen the psychotic breaks of my own father and I knew I was slipping , slipping . God , I shouldn&rsquo;t have been driving at that time . It&rsquo;s funny that they can test your alcohol level but not the fact that you haven&rsquo;t had a good night&rsquo;s sleep in months . & ldquo;Empire State Building , & rdquo ; said Oren as an image of New York flashed on the screen . He had lived in New York until he was four and was still crazy about the subways and big buildings , which he looked at on YouTube videos . I had not been able to bring him back for a visit in years , his behavior being too erratic , but his love for the city was strong . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The Chrysler Building , & rdquo ; he added a moment later . & nbsp;A few months earlier , when my friends&rsquo ; kids in the US were graduating from high school and my Israeli friends&rsquo ; kids were joining the army , Oren&rsquo;s father and I had gone to family court to become his legal guardians . That&rsquo;s what you will eventually have to do when you have a special-needs kid after he turns 18.The school sent home the initial paperwork , and a government representative came to the school to do back-to-back interviews with parents and the kids & ndash ; just a formality . Eventually , we had to go to the court building without Oren and do some final paperwork . A few weeks later , the document showing we were now his guardians arrived in the mail . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The Statue of Liberty , & rdquo ; Oren said , and my mind reeled with gratitude to the filmmakers and curators & ndash ; that they had come up with something that Oren found absorbing . & nbsp;The day before we visited the museum , The New York Times had run a magazine story on what they claimed were the nearly 10 % of people diagnosed with autism who & ldquo;lose their diagnosis&rdquo ; and become completely mainstreamed , usually as a result of a kind of behavioral therapy that had left Oren in worse shape than before he started it . People kept emailing this article to me . & nbsp;I have forgotten almost everything about the Dies Irae film , but it must have been a masterpiece because it made me forget about my mother and all of my other problems & ndash ; for as long as 20 seconds at a time . At the end of the film , a quote from the Requiem Mass appeared on screen , and I scrawled it down on the back page of The Financial Lives of the Poets:Remember that I am the cause of your journey;Do not lose me on that day.The most relaxing place in IsraelWE WALKED out of the children&rsquo;s wing . Oren asked to go home , but I couldn&rsquo;t face the nightly routine yet , with all the possibilities for tantrums and outbursts from my mother , so I suggested walking a little more in the sculpture garden and , to my surprise , he agreed . & nbsp;It can be the most relaxing place in Israel . Wherever you turn , there is another cluster of trees and another sculpture , and it seems as if you will never come to the end of it . We saw a small white entrance to a boxy structure . I assumed it would be filled with the kind of heavy abstract modern sculpture that I don&rsquo;t have patience for . But we walked in anyway . & nbsp;It was a small white marble room , ringed with benches . There was a square opening at the top , and when I looked up at it , I was blinded by the glare of the sun high in the sky . Oren walked across the empty space , sat down on the bench , and tilted his head back . I followed and sat down next to him as he put his feet on the bench and stretched out his long legs . I glanced around to see if there was a sign forbidding this & ndash ; we had been kicked out of so many other spots around the museum before . But there was nothing.I followed his gaze upward and saw that from the side we were on , the square framed a perfectly blue piece of sky , dotted with white wisps . This description doesn&rsquo;t do justice to the purity of the image . It was a brilliant exhibit , and there was no way you could look at it without being entranced by the beauty of the sky . I glanced at Oren lying there , so sweet and relaxed , and I stretched out myself , my head next to his , looking into that patch of blue & ndash ; and we drifted off to sleep . & nbsp;We were suddenly awakened by a large and stern guard . I sat up instantly , feeling startled but unusually rested . The problem wasn&rsquo;t that we had our legs on the bench ; it was that the museum was closing . & nbsp;Oren understood and was ready to leave . & nbsp;We walked slowly along the gravel path with the other stragglers . & nbsp;As I looked at Oren walking alongside the reflecting pool just outside the exit , the sun glittered on the water and I saw that I had not lost him & ndash ; and that I would never lose him . & nbsp ; ",‘ dies irae ’ - a short story
2024-06-10 20:31:56.270,jpost,"Defense Minister Yoav Gallant voted against his party , coalition , and the revival of an old haredi draft bill late Monday night , which was approved by the majority of the Knesset despite his rebellion.Gallant was applauded but immediately left the Knesset chamber after his vote , which led to a final tally of 63-57 to implement the Rule of Continuity procedure for the January 2022 security service law amendment to integrate yeshiva students.Otzma Yehudit MK Almog Cohen , who had retreated from threats that he would not vote with the coalition , shook Gallant&rsquo;s hand and gave him a look of sympathy as the minister departed.Cohen&rsquo;s vote in favor of the continuance of the bill came as opposition MKs and leaders had urged coalition members to follow Gallant&rsquo;s lead.In accordance with the procedure , which allows for the advancement of a bill that had been previously been approved in plenum readings , but abandoned by the Knesset&rsquo;s dissolution , the legislative remnant from the previous Israeli government will be transferred to the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee for preparation for further plenum readings.Opposition leader Yair Lapid slammed the vote that had dragged on into the late hours of the night as a one of the most & ldquo;despicable&rdquo ; moments of the Knesset & ndash ; it had allegedly failed to stand by its values , in favor of politics . & ldquo;The biggest sin is this government that dares to speak on behalf of [ IDF ] fighters , & rdquo ; said Lapid . & ldquo;Today the IDF announced that it needs 15 battalions . Where are we going to get them if this government encourages order refusal and draft dodging ? At least don&rsquo;t talk about your commitment to the fighters and then come here and pass laws on order refusal and draft dodging . Today the Knesset stands before more than 500 soldiers who were killed , in front all the people who did 180 days of reserve duty & ndash ; and the coalition will say we don&rsquo;t care about you , you don&rsquo;t interest us . & rdquo;Ultra-Orthodox draft evasionYisrael Beytenu leader Avigdor Liberman attacked the refusal by ultra-Orthodox leadership to embrace military service . & ldquo;I have never understood why a Jew is not allowed to be a combat soldier . Where does this appear in the sources ? I have found no trace of military service being contrary to Judaism . All the great Jewish leaders were all warriors , & rdquo ; said Liberman . & ldquo;You do not care at all about the Torah , there is nothing Jewish about this . All this to me is how this draft dodging is anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist . We lost a full brigade & ndash ; killed , injured . The security situation requires an increase in the manpower of the IDF . Evasion of everything , military or civilian service & ndash ; this is the most anti-Jewish thing . & rdquo;Security Committee Chairman MK Yuli Edelstein said that as Israel faced complex challenges , it was part of the political leadership&rsquo;s job to provide an accurate response to the security needs of the nation.This is a historical turning point for the people of Israel . It is necessary and we have no other choice . We all need a big , efficient and strong IDF and a big , efficient and strong IDF needs us all , & rdquo ; said Edelstein . & ldquo;We will do this in a clean , matter-of-fact manner and with the full cooperation of all actors . & rdquo;The security service law amendment to integrate yeshiva students would raise the age of exemption to 22 after two years , and again to 23 a year later . Ultra-orthodox youth would be offered alternative enlistment routes with the national emergency and rescue service , or a shortened three month or three week service . This would circumvent combat roles , which require several more months of training for qualification.The bill also introduced escalating consequences for religious schools that did not comply with enlistment quotas and regulations , with a 20 % decrease in government funding that would grow with consecutive years of violations.The law went through first reading during Lapid&rsquo;s tenure in a shared administration with then-alternate prime minister Naftali Bennett , but opposition members argued that the October 7 massacre had changed the Israeli paradigm and the legislation was obsolete.Coalition members also changed their position on the legislation , with MKs like Degel HaTorah leader Moshe Gafni arguing in the Budget Committee on Sunday that the opposition only sought to topple the government after the withdrawal of the National Unity party from the wartime emergency government and the coalition faced a March High Court interim order over military exemption for ultra-orthodox men in the wake of the April legislation deadline and a July 2023 draft law expiration . & nbsp ;",gallant applauded as he votes against his coalition's haredi draft law

2023-01-05 16:28:33.750,jpost,"Gaza's Health Ministry accused Israel on Thursday of delaying the entry of several X-ray machines needed to treat patients in the blockaded Palestinian territory.The ministry , run by the Gaza Strip's ruling terrorist group Hamas , said requests in the past 14 months for eight different types of X-ray machines and spare parts to repair existing equipment had been rejected or delayed.Dozens of other X-ray machines were allowed into the impoverished Strip during the same period.Israel , which together with Egypt maintains a blockade around Gaza citing security concerns , says it is worried about militant groups commandeering such machines for military purposes.Palestinian Health Ministry director Medhat Abbas said the equipment was funded by international relief and medical institutions on behalf of hospitals in Gaza . "" Holding back the entry of that equipment caused a delay in providing medical services to thousands of patients , "" Abbas told Reuters.Conflicting accountsResponding to his remarks , Israel's military-run Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories ( COGAT ) & nbsp ; accused Hamas and other militant groups of "" systematically and cynically taking advantage of humanitarian and civilian shipments of equipment and goods for terrorist purposes . "" Requests for such equipment , COGAT told Reuters , are examined on a case-by-case basis.Abbas said Israeli assertions about the medical equipment having dual uses were a lie.At Gaza City's Shifa hospital , Nalat Zeino , 51 , said she had been waiting 45 days to have an X-ray done for her kidneys . Doctors blamed the delay on the withholding of equipment . "" As if the pain I am feeling wasn't enough - waiting has been another form of torture , "" the mother of four told Reuters outside the X-ray unit.Hamas , deemed a terrorist group by Israel and much of the West , took control of Gaza in 2006 , a year after Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers.The ensuing blockade limiting the number of goods crossing in and out has crippled Gaza's economy and health care system , which suffers from a chronic shortage of hospital beds and medical equipment .",gaza claims israel not allowing in x-ray machines for medical care
2021-06-17 22:06:23.200,jpost,"& nbsp;Former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu oversaw some of the most virulent instances of diplomatic warfare against Israel since the & ldquo;Zionism equals racism&rdquo ; battle at the United Nations in the last century . & nbsp ; The Israeli-Palestinian and the larger Israeli-Arab conflict have long fueled attempts to turn the Jewish state into a pariah nation . & nbsp ; The stakes were raised , however , because of the 2012 vote in the UN General Assembly that upgraded the status of the Palestinians to that of a non-member state . The Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s newfound status as a de facto UN state gave it a more expansive toolbox by which to pursue Israel and force it to execute a civilian and military withdrawal to the pre-1967 lines . & nbsp ; At issue , however , was not just Israel&rsquo;s hold on the West Bank , east Jerusalem and the Golan Heights . The initiatives also took aim at Israel&rsquo;s Jewish identity , Jewish ties to its holy sites , and its right to self-defense . & nbsp ; Netanyahu offset some of that impact by linking some of the attacks with antisemitism and anti-Israel bias . He was more effective than past premiers in enlisting American support and in securing a circle of European , African and Asian allies . Issues of Palestinian incitement and support for terror also gained prominence during his tenure . & nbsp ; Here is a list of 12 victories and losses during his 12-year prime ministerial reign that began in March 2009 and ended this week . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Losses & nbsp ; 1 ) ICC opens war crimes probe against Israel & nbsp ; Israelis were not in danger of war crimes suits at the ICC when Netanyahu entered office . & nbsp ; The accession of the PA to the Rome Statute in 2015 changed that , and allowed the PA to request a war crimes probe into Israeli actions in the West Bank , Gaza and east Jerusalem . & nbsp ; The ICC ruled this year that it had jurisdiction to hear war crimes cases connected with that territory , and has opened a probe . While it is examining the possibility of war crimes cases against Israelis and Palestinians , it is presumed that the focus will be on potential Israeli war crimes . & nbsp ; Should the ICC conclude that a probe could be conducted , then individual Israelis , most likely its leaders , could find themselves facing war crimes charges . & nbsp ; 2 ) UNHRC creates permanent probe against Israel & nbsp ; The UNHRC during Netanyahu&rsquo;s tenure launched at least six fact-finding missions against Israel in an attempt to prove it had committed and continued to commit war crimes and serious human rights violations . & nbsp ; The most infamous was the initial probe headed by and named for South African jurist Richard Goldstone . & nbsp ; The Goldstone mission and two others explored potential Israeli war crimes during the three Gaza wars . One of the fact-finding missions probed alleged human rights abuses connected to West Bank settlements . The mission on the Hamas-led March of Return led to the creation of a database of IDF soldiers who potentially executed war crimes against the Palestinian participants . & nbsp ; This year the UNHRC created a permanent probe into potential Israeli human rights abuses , both within sovereign Israel and in the West Bank and Gaza , starting from April 13 , 2021 . Israel is the only country under permanent investigation for war crimes . & nbsp ; Separately it published a blacklist of companies doing business with Israeli entities located over the pre-1967 lines . It&rsquo;s the only country against whom such a blacklist has been published . & nbsp ; In 2018 it also began issuing an annual call for an arms embargo against Israel . & nbsp ; 3 ) UNESCO registers Tomb of the Patriarchs to Palestine & nbsp ; UNESCO became the first UN body to recognize Palestine as a state , in 2011 . PA membership at UNESCO allowed the registration of three sites onto its World Heritage List : the Church of the Nativity , the Battir terraces and the Tomb of the Patriarchs . The registration focused primarily on the period when the Tomb was under Mamluk control in 1250 and through the Ottoman Empire period , rather than on the ancient and Biblical periods when it was in Jewish hands . & nbsp ; Israel withdrew from UNESCO in 2018 to protest its anti-Israel bias , after halting its annual payments to the organization in 2011 and losing its voting rights two years later . & nbsp ; 4 ) EU product labeling & nbsp ; The European Union published guidelines in 2015 on how to place consumer labels on products from east Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza , to clarify that they were not produced in Israel . & nbsp ; The guidelines were voluntary . Four years later , however , the EU Court of Justice ruled that all Israeli products produced over the pre-1967 lines must be marked with such consumer labels . & nbsp ; 5)UN launches apartheid investigation&nbsp ; & nbsp ; The UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination this year ceded to a request by the Palestinian Authority to investigate whether Israel had committed acts of apartheid . It would mark the first such UN investigation into such a charge based on the definition set out in the Rome Statute . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Victories & nbsp ; 1 ) Abraham Accords put a damper on BDS & nbsp ; The Abraham Accords , which normalized ties between Israel and four Arab countries , took some of the wind out of the sails of the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement . The willingness of Arab countries to do business with Israel made it more difficult for BDS to argue that other countries should boycott it . & nbsp ; 2 ) ICC Mavi Marmara war crimes probe nixed & nbsp ; The International Criminal Court chief prosecutor rejected a request to probe Israel for war crimes relating to the IDF raid in 2010 against the Gaza-bound flotilla ship Mavi Marmara . The IDF forcibly boarded the ship as it attempted to break Israel&rsquo;s maritime blockade of Gaza . During the raid , 10 Turkish activists aboard the ship were killed . & nbsp ; 3 ) Only one UNSC anti-Israel resolution passed & nbsp ; The UN Security Council condemned Israel only once during Netanyahu&rsquo;s tenure , which is a record in the institution&rsquo;s treatment of Israel . It was the direct result of Netanyahu&rsquo;s ability to secure opposition to such resolutions from former US presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump . The only exception was in 2016 , in the final weeks of the Obama administration , when the UNSC approved Resolution 2334 that condemned Israeli settlement activity and rejected Israeli sovereignty over any part of east Jerusalem , including the Western Wall . & nbsp ; 4 ) Partial victory on the Jerusalem resolutions & nbsp ; The PA pushed for the UN to ignore Jewish ties to the Temple Mount by referencing that site and the Western Wall solely by their Muslim names of Al-Haram Al-Sharif and the Buraq Plaza . With the support of Arab states , it began to insert Muslim-only references in resolutions on Jerusalem passed by the UNESCO Executive Board at each of its bi-annual meetings . Those texts also disavowed Jewish sovereignty over Jerusalem . & nbsp ; The Jerusalem resolutions were neutralized at UNESCO through a compromise in which the controversial elements of the text were placed in an annex . The PA has been more successful with a similar drive at the General Assembly , where it has an automatic majority of support . & nbsp ; 5 ) Agenda Item 7 boycott & nbsp ; Netanyahu made no headway in swaying the UN Human Rights Council to rescind its mandate that the 47-member body discusses alleged Israeli human rights abuses against the Palestinians at every one of its sessions under Agenda Item 7 . & nbsp ; But it successfully swayed European countries that the existence of such a mandate against only one country was an example of anti-Israel bias . As a result , most of the European countries boycott Agenda Item 7 sessions , which take place three times a year . & nbsp ; 6 ) Spotlight on Pay-for-Slay & nbsp ; Netanyahu made significant inroads in persuading European and Western countries , particularly the United States , to take the Palestinian Authority to task for providing monthly stipends to Palestinian terrorists and their relatives . Israel has dubbed the practice & ldquo;pay-for-slay . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The US took a strong stand on the issue , with Congress passing the Taylor Force Act that prohibits direct economic assistance to the PA until it halts the payments . & nbsp ; 7 ) Condemnation of UNRWA incitement & nbsp ; Netanyahu also succeeded in generating awareness of UNRWA&rsquo;s failure to ensure that its textbooks did not include inciting material against Jews and Israel . & nbsp ; The Biden administration has promised to link future funding to UNRWA to its adherence to a zero-tolerance policy for material that promotes hate and antisemitism against Jews and Israel . & nbsp ; The EU Parliament this year also condemned any use by UNRWA of such material .",netanyahu’s diplomatic warfare with the palestinians : 12 highs and lows

Israeli officials have said that the two , and other Hamas leaders located both in the Gaza Strip and abroad , are "" dead men walking .

On Monday , he launched the Friedman Center for Peace throughStrength to help continue to advance the accords . He has just completed a documentary on the process and is authoring a book on the initiative.The accords , he said , were possible because they were backed by a strong US that guided and encourages ties between Arab nations and Israel , offering political , economic and security support.Friedman never mentioned the US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan , but he appeared to reference it when he said that the Biden administration needs to convince Arab states that it can be depended on as a strong regional ally.Countries that signed the Abraham Accords and those that could join the deal are asking , & ldquo;Is America going to be a reliable partner going into the future ? All these countries depend on a strong America , & rdquo ; Friedman said.He also spoke to the Biden administration&rsquo;s attempt to revive the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action . The plan , otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal , wasdesigned to limit Iran&rsquo;s nuclear capacity and was signed between Tehran and six world powers.The former Trump administration exited the deal and the Biden administration has sought to revive it , but third-party talks held in Vienna have stalled.In the interim , Iran has advanced toward the production of a nuclear weapon , a move that diplomats and pundits have speculated could soon render the idea of reviving the JCPOA irrelevant.Friedman said the Biden administration had to be on only one of two paths ; it could halt Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program through maximum sanctions and covert action , or it could engage in talks with regard to a new deal that would replace the JCPOA.But this gray area , in which there was an absence of diplomacy and maximum pressure , was not applied and was unsustainable . He also cautioned the Biden administration against lifting sanctions just for the option of continuing talks to revive the 2015 Iran deal.It does not make sense , he said , & ldquo;to let up on sanctions , reduce the pressure and beg for a diplomatic outcome . & rdquo;Watch the Jerusalem Post 10th Annual Conference video & gt ; & gt ;",friedman : a us retreat from world stage could doom abraham accords

Earlier in the day , Palestinian media published photos of terrorists preparing such balloons to launch towards Israel . At least one explosive balloon was reported over southern Israel , with residents reporting that they saw and heard the balloon explode in the air , according to Israeli media . Three Gazans were arrested by the IDF after they crossed the Gaza border fence into Israel , according to Palestinian reports . & nbsp ; As part of security preparations in light of the flag march , the paths of flights to and from Ben-Gurion Airport were diverted to leave and arrive from the North on Tuesday . Iron Dome anti-missile defense units were also reinforced ahead of the march , amid threats by Hamas in recent days and weeks .

Tamir Heiman , IDF intelligence analysis chief Brig . - Gen . Amit Saar and Defense Ministry Policy and Political-Military Bureau head Zohar Palti . & nbsp ; No further information about the meeting was released in the statement by Gantz @ @ @ s office . Despite the lack of rocket fire , Hamas celebrated what it termed a & quot;confirmation&quot ; of the deterrence situation after Operation Guardian of the Walls , after Israel changed flight paths and the path of the flag march and intensified the deployment of the Iron Dome due to concerns of rocket fire . & nbsp ; & quot;The courageous stances of the Palestinian resistance , and its decisive decisions that forced the Israeli occupation to change the path of the so-called march of flags away from the blessed Al-Aqsa Mosque , change the path of civil aviation , and intensify the deployment of the Iron Dome , confirm the achievement of the deterrence equation it imposed in the Battle of Saif al-Quds , and its success in imposing&nbsp ; new rules of engagement on the enemy , & quot ; said Hamas on Tuesday night . & nbsp ; & quot;The valiant resistance will remain the protective shield for our people , and the behavior of the Israeli occupation on the ground will determine the course and nature of dealing with it , & quot ; added Hamas . Former Military Intelligence head Amos Yadlin told Army Radio on Wednesday morning that , while Operation Guardian of the Walls had achieved a & quot;great deal&quot ; of deterrence , it had not achieved complete deterrence , as evidenced by the incendiary balloons . & nbsp ; & quot;Hamas threatened , but remembered what happened to it when it fired on Jerusalem - so it did not fire yesterday , & quot ; added Yadlin . & quot;There is a miss opportunity to create new rules . If Hamas knows that after burning fields we will attack empty compounds - it will continue . & quot ; After Operation Guardian of the Walls&nbsp;in mid-May , Gantz warned that Israel would respond forcefully to any act of aggression against Israel . & nbsp ; While Gantz stressed that he & quot;wasn @ @ @ t promising&quot ; to attack for & quot;every rocket or balloon at 3 a.m . & quot ; he added that he would attack when it was & quot;convenient&quot ; for Israel . Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has also made statements in the past warning that incendiary balloons would be treated like rockets . & nbsp ; The Hamas terrorist movement had called for a & quot;Day of Rage&quot ; to confront the long-awaited and controversial flag march on Tuesday , encouraging Palestinians to & quot;mobilize&quot ; at al-Aqsa and the Old City of Jerusalem . & nbsp ; & quot;Let next Tuesday be a day of mobilization and a bond towards al-Aqsa Mosque , and a day of anger and defiance of the occupier , & quot ; said Hamas in a statement on Sunday . & quot;Show God and your people what you have done in it , and be the best sword for Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa . & quot ; & nbsp ; Palestinian Islamic Jihad released a statement on Tuesday stating that it will respond & quot;with full force to the provocations of the settlers in the Holy City , & quot ; ahead of the flag march being held later in the evening . & nbsp ; PIJ called for Palestinians to gather throughout Jerusalem , especially at al-Aqsa Mosque and in areas where the flag march is scheduled to pass . & nbsp ; Additional Palestinian groups echoed the calls , calling for a confrontation with Israel if Jerusalem is & quot;violated . & quot ; Despite the threats , the march took place with relatively little violence .

He was transferred to the Ibn Sina hospital in Jenin for medical care and then to Rambam Medical Center in Haifa , following a request from the Palestinians when his condition deteriorated.The hospital confirmed his death . Israel is reportedly withholding his body . & nbsp;Following attacks in which Palestinians are killed by Israeli security forces , their bodies are regularly taken to Israel . Though bodies are sometimes retired to their families at a later date to be buried , Israel has also withheld bodies in order to be used as part of future negotiations and as a deterrent against terror attacks . & nbsp;The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades in Jenin had warned on Saturday that & ldquo;any harm to the life of the wounded Daoud Al-Zubeidi will open the fire of hell in the face of the Zionist enemy and herds of criminal settlers . & rdquo;Zubeidi&rsquo;s brother Zakaria escaped from Gilboa Prison along with three other security prisoners in September . He was once considered a & ldquo;symbol of the Intifada , & rdquo ; but renounced militancy over a decade ago and was awarded clemency by Israel after he agreed to give up arms.He had been arrested by the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) in 2019 following intelligence that he was planning a serious attack in the West Bank and for two shooting attacks against Israeli buses in the West Bank near Beit El and Psagot.During the clashes in which Zubeidi was injured , YAMAM counterterrorism officer Sgt . - Maj . Noam Raz was shot and critically wounded . He was evacuated to Rambam hospital by helicopter where he succumbed to his wounds.A senior IDF officer told journalists that said he was shot in the back as forces were leaving the village under fire . & ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been through everything over the past 20 years , but there were thousands of bullets fired towards us and our vehicles this morning , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;It was indescribable . & rdquo;Raz was buried on Sunday morning on Mount Herzl with hundreds of mourners in attendance.Security forces have been on high alert across the country as Israeli Arabs and Palestinians mark Nakba Day & ndash ; the 74th anniversary of what the Arab world refer to as & ldquo;the catastrophe&rdquo ; following the founding in 1948 of the State of Israel.Tensions are already high following a spate of deadly terrorist attacks that have killed 19 people in Israel .",brother of palestinian security prisoner injured in jenin clashes succumbs to wounds
2024-06-03 02:27:10.327,jpost,"& lsquo;I wanted to express the very bizarre and extreme reality of these trips , what it&rsquo;s really like to be there at that age , & rdquo ; said Asaf Saban , the writer/director of Delegation , a new feature film that opened on Thursday and looks at teens on a high-school class trip to Poland , where they visit death camps & ndash ; a quintessentially Israeli rite of passage.Saban knew that making a dramatic film about the reality of such trips , rather than the ideal , would not be easy . But he has created a thoughtful , compelling film , well-written and well acted , that illuminates the complexities of one of these trips in the & rsquo;90s . & nbsp;It neither sentimentalizes the characters&rsquo ; emotions nor condemns the teens for just being teens . He did that through creating several quirky , relatable characters , among them Frisch ( Yoav Bavly , ) a sensitive guy , who has a crush on Nitzan ( Naomi Harari , ) an ostensibly relaxed , confident girl.But Nitzan is more troubled than she seems , and the trip brings out strange emotions in her , which cause her to take an action on one of the concentration camp tours that is very human but obviously wrong . Ido ( Leib Levin ) is a brash extrovert focused on usual teen concerns like girls and drinking , and doesn&rsquo;t suddenly become an altruist in Poland.Delegation spotlights how there is some manipulation built into these trips , as the teens have group discussions in which they are encouraged to show emotion , the more intense the better . The difficulties created by this are illustrated by the character of Yosef ( Ezra Dagan , in a heartrending performance , ) and Frisch&rsquo;s grandfather . He is a survivor who accompanies the class . & nbsp;As the grandfather begins telling his personal story to the group , he speaks charmingly and engagingly about his life and experiences as a child before his family was deported . But it&rsquo;s rambling , contains a great deal of personal details , and isn&rsquo;t what the group leader ( Alma Dishy ) wants to hear . She is portrayed not as a villain but as a cog in a system designed to elicit a particular set of reactions : tears at the horrors and pride in the State of Israel . & nbsp;In one of the film&rsquo;s most moving scenes , she takes the survivor aside and he admits that he knows he hasn&rsquo;t been saying what the students need to hear . & ldquo;I get it . You want me to get to the action more quickly , & rdquo ; he says . As the film goes on , he is overwhelmed by emotion and can&rsquo;t & ldquo;get to the action . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Prize winningIt's not surprising that Saban&rsquo;s complex , multi-layered script won the Anat Pirchi Best Screenplay Award at the Jerusalem Film Festival last year , or that his cast took the Best Ensemble Award there . And it&rsquo;s particularly heartening that the film received recognition in Poland , where it won a special award at the Warsaw Film Festival . & nbsp;The film was inspired by Saban&rsquo;s own experiences on such a trip years ago . & ldquo;It was the first time I was abroad without my parents . That&rsquo;s an important detail , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;There is something festive about being abroad . I remember the excitement and my wish , and I think this is characteristic of young people that age , regardless , whether they are Israeli or not , whether it is a Holocaust trip or not , to experience something great . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The reality for me is that I remember the trip in fragments , and I remember feeling that I didn&rsquo;t respond in the way I was meant to . I don&rsquo;t remember much about the historical sites . I have many meaningless memories of small moments . I think this is what characterizes us as human beings , the gap between the expectations and what we really take away from the experience . & rdquo;He said he wasn&rsquo;t interested in debating whether the trips are worthwhile or questioning the motivations of the students who take them . & ldquo;Before you place a lot of political and sociological interpretation on them , the reality of these trips is that they are a very extreme and weird experience . & ldquo;As weird as they are , these trips are the ultimate normative experience for Israeli teens . It&rsquo;s a dissonance that is fascinating for me , because it says a lot . I wanted to look at it and give more weight to the subtext . People go into this territory with a lot of expectations and preconceived opinions that are all expressed with an exclamation point . & nbsp ; & ldquo;For me , it was very important to speak quietly , with sensitivity and to direct the viewer&rsquo;s glance to the nuances and ask questions , and not necessarily give answers . I wanted to replace the exclamation points with question marks . & rdquo;He always kept in mind the importance of the reality of the Holocaust and to treat it with respect , not to exploit it for drama . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that I as a filmmaker am very sensitive to , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;It&rsquo;s an ethical question . How do you create a drama in such places [ where the Holocaust took place ] ? You can manipulate the viewers emotionally , by using imagery and using the Holocaust as a drama in the background to elicit emotions , in ways that are too easy . And the dilemma I felt as a filmmaker mirrors what the students go through there . & rdquo;Saban made a point of creating & ldquo;very typical characters , who are dealing with small , ordinary problems . My challenge was to shift the attention to the details and dynamics among these characters in the present , when in the background you have the greatest drama , not just in Jewish history , but in the history of humanity . & rdquo;Speaking about the character of the grandfather who is not encouraged to express his story fully and in depth , he said , & ldquo;I think he wants to succeed . He wants to perform his role in the way that is expected of him . He has the will to do it , but not the ability . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Saban said that the toughest task for him was to put aside his perspective as an adult and recapture the feeling of what it was like to be in Poland and at the death camps at age 17 . & nbsp;But with Yosef , he allowed himself to look at the experience with the eyes of a more mature person . & ldquo;There is a similarity between how I wanted to tell the story of the students in the film and how Yosef wants to tell his story . & rdquo ; & nbsp;When a sheepish Yosef admits to the teacher that he knows he isn&rsquo;t getting to & ldquo;the action&rdquo ; & ndash ; the horrors & ndash ; quickly enough and will try to do better , that sentence expresses something that Saban was also grappling with . & ldquo;I&rsquo;m also saying to the viewers , you come to this with expectations , but maybe you won&rsquo;t get the action in the places you expect , at the volume that you&rsquo;re expecting to hear . & nbsp ; & ldquo;With the character of Yosef , he is the storyteller , but he isn&rsquo;t the storyteller you expect . The fact that he fails and can&rsquo;t finish his task in the way that is expected of him & ndash ; that is the deepest and truest proof of his authenticity , of the authenticity of his experiences and his feelings . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s life . People like Anne Frank and Etty Hillesum succeeded in expressing their humanity in the context of their personal experiences , and that&rsquo;s what creates the drama of their stories . That&rsquo;s why you remember them . & rdquo ;",israeli director tackles film about a class trip to poland
2024-06-05 03:43:14.223,jpost,"( JTA ) - The musician Jonny Greenwood was pushing back on critics who said he should abandon a plan to tour with an Israeli collaborator because of the Israel-Hamas war.Greenwood and Dudu Tassa , an Israeli rock star from a prominent Mizrahi musical family , were scheduled to perform together on the European festival circuit this summer , a year after they released a joint record that featured singers from across the Middle East . Some of the dates were rescheduled after the pair canceled shows in the immediate wake of Hamas&rsquo ; October 7 attack on Israel.The performances are drawing criticism amid widespread anti-Israel sentiment in the arts and in Europe , and Greenwood has faced calls to cancel.In a statement posted to social media on Tuesday , he said he would do no such thing - and said that calls to silence Israeli artists are counterproductive . & ldquo;Others choose to believe this kind of project is unjustifiable and are urging the silence of this - or any - artistic effort made by Israeli Jews , & rdquo ; Greenwood wrote . & ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t join that call : The silencing of Israeli film makers/musicians/dancers when their work tours abroad - especially when it&rsquo;s at the urging of their fellow western filmmakers/musicians/artists - feels unprogressive to me , not least because these people that are invariably the most progressive members of any society . & rdquo;Greenwood&rsquo;s relationship to Israel is long . He is married to Israeli visual artist Sharona Katan , who has said the family identifies as Jewish , and recorded guitar on albums by Tassa and fellow Israeli Shye Ben Tzur before making the album with Tassa . Both artists opened for Radiohead on some tour dates in 2017.Music unites against boycottsTassa is the grandson of Daoud Al-Kuwaity , one of the most famous Iraqi composers of the 20th century who emigrated to Israel in 1951 . In his statement , Greenwood notes that the songs of Al-Kuwaity and his brother Saleh & ldquo;are still staples of Arab-wide radio stations - though sadly their heritage as Jews is never mentioned . & rdquo;Radiohead , which won several Grammy Awards and sold millions of records since the 1990s , have been the targets of the boycott , divestment and sanctions movement against Israel , especially in the lead-up to their 2017 concert in Tel Aviv . In response , lead singer Thom Yorke called BDS protesters & ldquo;offensive&rdquo ; and & ldquo;patronizing , & rdquo ; adding , & ldquo;The person who knows most about these things is Jonny . & rdquo;In an Instagram post this week , Tassa called Greenwood & ldquo;an amazing person who is always willing to take risks for peace and justice&rdquo ; and a dear friend . & ldquo;Our desire and choice as musicians from different backgrounds ( he is an English rocker and I am a Jewish-Israeli who absorbed roots of Arab culture ) have always been and will continue to be , to strive to understand the & lsquo;other , & rsquo ; to get to know him and to introduce him to us through the language of music - completely the opposite of fostering a one-sided discourse of boycotts and threats , & rdquo ; Tassa wrote . & ldquo;The truth is that the boycotters and condemners do not promote anything - just more hatred , & rdquo ; he added . & ldquo;I hope and wish that together our performance will unite and connect people from different backgrounds and be part of a small step towards a better future . & rdquo;Greenwood did not explicitly mention the war , the Palestinians or Gaza in his statement , angering some of his critics . But he acknowledged that his planned performances with Tassa come at a difficult time . & ldquo;No art is as & lsquo;important&rsquo ; as stopping all the death and suffering around us . How can it be ? But doing nothing seems a worse option , & rdquo ; he wrote . & ldquo;And silencing Israeli artists for being born Jewish in Israel doesn&rsquo;t seem like any way to reach an understanding between the two sides of this apparently endless conflict . & rdquo ;",radiohead’s jonny greenwood rejects calls to cancel tour with israeli musician dudu tassa

The detainees claimed they decided to suspend the hunger strike after receiving promises from the Israeli authorities to look into their demands . & nbsp;Also last year , hundreds of Palestinian administrative detainees boycotted Israeli courts as part of a campaign to put pressure on Israel to end the policy . & nbsp;The planned hunger strike aims to exert pressure on Israel regarding the issue of administrative detention and protest against the death of senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad detainee Khader Adnan , who died in Israeli custody last week after an 86-day hunger strike , the committee said in a letter reportedly smuggled from one of the prisons . & nbsp;It did not set a date for the start of the hunger strike . & nbsp;In response to the death of Adnan , 44 , Palestinian terror groups in the Gaza Strip last week fired more than 100 rockets at Israel before an unofficial ceasefire was announced with the help of Egypt , Qatar and the United Nations . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We have become certain beyond doubt that the occupation and the Shin Bet ( Israel&rsquo;s Internal Security Agency ) can&rsquo;t provide positive results on the level of the administrative detention file unless they come under real pressure , & rdquo ; the committee said.It pointed out that efforts to solve the issue of administrative detention began two years ago with hunger strikes and boycotts of Israeli courts.According to the committee , the administrative detainees&rsquo ; decision to declare a hunger strike was taken after & ldquo;round-the-clock consultations and coordination&rdquo ; with representatives of the Palestinian factions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . & ldquo;We are facing a historic moment and we must take advantage of it , & rdquo ; the committee said.A leader of the Palestinian security prisoners held in Israeli jails was quoted on Saturday as saying that a large number of inmates belonging to Hamas and other Palestinian factions would take part in the hunger strike.The unnamed leader , who was quoted by the Hamas-affiliated Palestine Information Center , said the detainees who are planning to take part in the hunger strike were on a & ldquo;suicide&rdquo ; mission . & ldquo;The decision to go on hunger strike was taken after the martyrdom of Sheikh Khader Adnan , & rdquo ; he said.Zaher Jabareen , a member of the Hamas political bureau , said the Palestinians and their & ldquo;resistance&rdquo ; groups stand behind the administrative detainees in their & ldquo;battle&rdquo ; against the Israeli authorities .

This proposed regulation will largely focus on protecting the elderly and new immigrants.Karhi stated , "" Service to the public in general and consumer protection , in particular , are the basis for any action or intervention in the free market . & nbsp ; "" In most cases , non-intervention in the market serves the public well , but corrective action is required in cases of monopoly , exploitation , and fraud . & nbsp ; "" Under my leadership , the Communications Ministry will continue to promote a free and competitive market in terms of quality and price , protecting those vulnerable to exploitation . This is what we did with surprise charges for calls abroad , excessive fees on standing orders , the failure to give pensioners discounts at the postal bank , and also here in the issue of exploitation . "" Increase in attempted telephone fraud since start of warAccording to reports by the Communications Ministry , since the start of the war , there has been a sharp increase in telephone fraud attempts , mainly targeting the elderly population , especially among Russian-speaking immigrants . & nbsp;These activities can target both commercial and public entities by utilizing their phone numbers as identifiers , making calls to subscribers appear on their phone screens as originating from legitimate sources.The impostors aim to steal personal and credit information from the victims or persuade them to make various financial transfers under false pretenses . & nbsp;Typically , this scheme unfolds when the impostors allege that the victim's bank accounts or credit cards have been compromised . They then insist that the victim withdraw their funds and transfer them , ostensibly to secure police accounts or coerce them into divulging passwords and sensitive information.Alongside the police , the Communications Ministry is working to prevent the display&nbsp;of false numbers on cellular devices.Following an increase in scam attempts , which primarily affect the elderly population , and in continuation of prevention activities carried out by relevant authorities , the Communications Ministry published on Sunday a draft amendment to regulations in which provisions are considered to mitigate the phenomenon of impersonation of law enforcement agencies and companies using their phone numbers . & nbsp;The draft regulations under consideration include a provision stating that an international service provider must block calls originating from outside Israel if the caller's number is an Israeli landline.Additionally , it stipulates that a mobile phone service provider should block calls from outside the State of Israel if the caller's number is a mobile phone , except for its roaming customers.Further , a service provider will not allow its subscribers to use numbers that are not allocated for their use.Following the necessary preparation period of several months , the changes to this draft regulation are expected to take effect during the coming year to ensure comprehensive protection for the public .",this is how israel plans to combat telephone fraud targeting the elderly

In response , the Border Police undercover operatives opened fire at the vehicle and killed the terrorist and the three additional terrorists.Combat gear foundDuring the search of the vehicle , a Carlo-type weapon , a vest , and explosive devices were found.According to reports , one of the terrorists was from a terror cell that had intended to attack Jewish Israelis and had set fire to a caravan at Sde Ephraim Farm on Monday.During the operation , an undercover operative was lightly injured in his foot and was evacuated for medical treatment.The official Palestinian news agency WAFA said Israeli forces opened fire at a vehicle near a village outside the city of Ramallah .

Eventually , the commander calls it off.IDF waited until targeted Islamic Jihad commanders were away from civiliansIn fact , the initiation of the counterstrike operation early Tuesday morning , with a weeklong delay since Islamic Jihad fired more than 100 rockets on Israel on May 2-3 , was partially to wait until the three top Islamic Jihad commanders were all in areas with fewer nearby civilians.Despite waiting , a number of family members and other civilians were killed during the attacks.International laws of war stipulate the limiting of civilian casualties as much as possible . Nevertheless , some ancillary civilian casualties are permitted when the military target that is among them presents a sufficient advantage . What those terms mean is hotly debated.On the one hand , Israel is criticized by many international bodies when civilians die from its attacks . On the other hand , the IDF has received compliments from other militaries for cutting-edge tactics to avoid civilian casualties and zero in on strikes.About 25 % of Islamic Jihad&rsquo;s rockets landed within Gaza , harming Gazans or their property , the IDF said Thursday . The terrorist group&rsquo;s rockets killed four Gazan civilians , ages 51 , 16 , 16 and 10 , it said.The statistics showed the poor quality of Islamic Jihad&rsquo;s rockets and rocket crews , it added . They also indicated that Islamic Jihad regularly violates international laws of war by having its rocket crews in civilian areas in the Gaza Strip , as well as firing on Israeli civilians , rather than ensuring that they fire from areas where the rockets could not hit their own population , the IDF said . & nbsp ;",watch : idf calls off airstrike to avoid hitting palestinian children

2023-07-01 05:11:26.597,jpost,"Palestinian officials are enraged by reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told an Israeli parliamentary committee Monday that he rejects an independent Palestinian state but is also not interested in the Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s ( PA ) demise.Palestinian hopes of establishing a sovereign state & ldquo;must be eliminated , & rdquo ; Netanyahu told Knesset ( Israeli parliament ) committee members in a closed-door meeting about his government&rsquo;s plans for the eventual departure of PA President Mahmoud Abbas . & ldquo;We are preparing for the period after Abu Mazen [ Mahmoud Abbas ] , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said , adding that Israel & ldquo;need[s ] the Palestinian Authority . We must not allow it to collapse . & rdquo;The Israeli prime minister said his government was ready to offer economic support to the PA based in the West Bank town of Ramallah.Netanyahu&rsquo;s remarks were reported on a radio news program owned by KAN , the Israeli public broadcaster.The Palestinian Authority's response to Netanyahu's remarks on statehoodIn an official response , Hussein al-Sheikh , civil affairs minister for the PA , rejected Netanyahu&rsquo;s remarks . & ldquo;The role of the Palestinian Authority is to achieve the Palestinian national project of freedom , independence , and protection of the Palestinian people , & rdquo ; Sheikh said . The PA & ldquo;has not and will not accept anything other than this national and historical role . & rdquo;Palestinians have long sought to establish an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , with eastern Jerusalem as its capital , alongside Israel . This arrangement is popularly known as the & ldquo;two-state solution&rdquo ; to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.The Israeli Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office did not deny Netanyahu&rsquo;s comments . If accurate , Palestinian leaders say , the comments prove the premier&rsquo;s & ldquo;true motives . & rdquo ; In years past , Netanyahu has offered perfunctory support for the internationally backed notion of an independent Palestinian state , provided it had no military or security power.Netanyahu&rsquo;s statements aroused widespread anger in other Palestinian political quarters.Nabil Abu Rudeineh , Abbas&rsquo ; spokesperson , said that establishing an independent Palestinian state , with East Jerusalem as its capital , is the only solution to achieve long-term security and stability . & ldquo;Netanyahu may not hope for the collapse of the PA , publicly at least , but his goal is clear : Keep it as weak as can be , & rdquo ; an aide to President Abbas told The Media Line . The aide , who requested anonymity , insisted that the PA is a & ldquo;national achievement&rdquo ; that no one , including Netanyahu , can change . & ldquo;The alternative to the PA collapse is chaos , and it will mean the end of the Oslo Accords and any peace process , & rdquo ; he said.Israeli and Palestinian leaders signed the first and second Oslo Accords in 1993 and 1995 . In those agreements , Palestinian leaders recognized Israel&rsquo;s right to exist in return for Israel&rsquo;s recognition of the Palestinian people&rsquo;s right to self-determination.Many assumed those agreements would eventually lead to a two-state solution . However , Talks remain frozen , and the Palestine Authority has limited control over roughly 40 % of the West Bank . In Gaza , a Palestinian Islamist group , Hamas , seized power from the PA in 2007 . & ldquo;We know what we want , but Israel can&rsquo;t seem to get itself to say clearly and publicly what it wants . We are at the mercy of those who are controlling the government , whose main goal is to appease their electoral base , & rdquo ; the PA aide argued.US-based Palestinian affairs expert Hasan Awwad told The Media Line that the collapse of the PA is & ldquo;underway&rdquo ; and & ldquo;inevitable&rdquo ; as its effectiveness is & ldquo;dismal . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Israel has been increasing its settlement expansion , making it impossible to create a Palestinian state . There is no political horizon , and Palestinians don&rsquo;t see the light at the end of the tunnel , & rdquo ; Awwad said.Many believe Netanyahu began implementing a plan to eliminate the possibility of a viable Palestinian state years ago . The Israeli leader , who chairs the right-wing Likud party , ruled the country from 1996 to 1999 , 2009 to 2021 , and January this year.During that time , critics say , his governments have expanded West Bank settlements and built new roads in such a way as to exclude the establishment of a territorially contiguous , sovereign Palestinian state.Since retaking office in January , the veteran Israeli politician&rsquo;s ruling coalition , which is more religious and nationalist than its predecessors , has approved building over 7,000 new housing units for Jewish Israelis living in West Bank settlements.Many in the international community regard those settlements as violations of the Geneva Conventions and an impediment to peace . However , Netanyahu and his coalition partners regard the settlements as Jewish return to an area they once ruled.Ahmad Rafiq Awad , president of the Center for Jerusalem Studies at Al-Quds University , told The Media Line , & ldquo;It is clear that Netanyahu was never an advocate of a two-state solution . & rdquo ; Now , Awad says , Netanyahu has & ldquo;finally revealed his real strategy : he is not serious about having a neighboring Palestinian state . & rdquo;Unlike ministers in his government who have called for an end to PA rule in parts of the West Bank , however , Netanyahu does not want the Ramallah-based authority to disappear . Instead , Awad says , Netanyahu wants the PA to help Israel & ldquo;manage the occupation and maintain the status quo . & rdquo;The Ramallah-based authority , Awwad says , & ldquo;has helped whitewash Israeli occupation legally , morally , and financially . & rdquo ; Netanyahu wants & ldquo;an agent that does the dirty work for Israel , and the PA does part of that , & rdquo ; he added.Palestinian forces are responsible for municipal services and internal security in the West Bank&rsquo;s areas A and B . In practice , Palestinian police often tacitly cooperate with the Israeli military in its pursuit of suspects.Palestinian political institutions are under increasing economic pressure . For example , Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh warned recently that his agency was not receiving its regular disbursements of international aid , threatening its ability to continue operations.Moien Odeh , a specialist in Palestinian affairs , human rights , and international law , told The Media Line that Netanyahu&rsquo;s remarks are , in fact , nothing new.Israel , Odeh says , has always regarded the PA as & ldquo;a subcontractor&rdquo ; responsible for Palestinians&rsquo ; & ldquo;daily needs&rdquo ; and some of Israel&rsquo;s & ldquo;security concerns . & rdquo ; It also offers Israel relief from international pressure to maintain a semblance of political negotiations and provide for some of the Palestinians&rsquo ; needs.Now , however , & ldquo;Netanyahu said explicitly that the Palestine Authority is the end [ goal ] , not a step toward [ an eventual Palestinian ] state , & rdquo ; as others have assumed since Oslo . & ldquo;Of course , & rdquo ; Odeh says , & ldquo;the policy and actions of all Israeli governments have always been in this direction . & rdquo;The Palestinian Authority has failed to unite Palestinians , Odeh says , and its fate has always been & ldquo;linked to Israel in most or even all respects . & rdquo ; The authority cannot & ldquo;survive without Israeli and international support and funding , & rdquo ; keeping it & ldquo;permanently hostage to aid . & rdquo ;",palestinians furious over netanyahu claims that israel must ' crush ' statehood ambitions

2024-06-17 20:36:45.880,jpost,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s decision to dissolve Israel&rsquo;s war cabinet raises several questions about the management of the war against Hamas from now on.The war cabinet , which was also known as the & ldquo;small cabinet , & rdquo ; was authorized to make day-to-day decisions regarding the war while bringing broader policy decisions to the larger , statutory security cabinet.In response to a query by The Jerusalem Post , a spokesperson for the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office said that the security cabinet will now be convened at a higher frequency . In addition , Netanyahu will hold ad-hoc & ldquo;security consultations&rdquo ; on specific matters when necessary.The spokesperson did not answer a number of follow-up questions , including what the division of responsibilities will be between the security cabinet and these & ldquo;consultations . & rdquo;Furthermore , the spokesperson did not address the statutory status of these consultations , such as whether they will be transcribed in an official protocol like the now-defunct war cabinet did . They also did not specify who would participate in these consultations.The deliberations will likely serve two purposes : The first will be to avoid having to convene the security cabinet over minor decisions , and the second will be to keep sensitive information away from the far Right Ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.Both Ben-Gvir and Smotrich , who are both members of the security cabinet but were not appointed to the war cabinet , repeatedly criticized the latter since its founding for policies that they believed were not aggressive enough . In addition , many leaks emerged from the security cabinet during the months of the war , with Ben-Gvir believed to be the source of many of these.Ben-Gvir , Smotrich's threats were feltThis led the prime minister to avoid including them in certain decisions or revealing specific information . For example , according to Ben-Gvir , Netanyahu refused to show him a draft of Israel&rsquo;s latest proposal for a ceasefire and hostage deal with Hamas.Still , according to MKs Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot of the National Unity Party , who , until recently , were members of the war cabinet , the presence of Ben-Gvir&rsquo;s and Smotrich&rsquo;s threats to leave the government over what they deemed were unacceptable concessions to Hamas , was felt tangibly in the room . Gantz and Eisenkot said that at one point , Netanyahu limited the mandate given to Israel&rsquo;s negotiating team without updating them due to pressure from Smotrich.Both Ben-Gvir and Smotrich demanded to be part of the war cabinet once Gantz and Eisenkot left the government last week.However , instead of conceding to their requests , Netanyahu opted to dissolve the war cabinet completely . Nevertheless , it is clear that Ben-Gvir and Smotrich will now enjoy even more influence over security decisions given that the security cabinet will convene more frequently.In interviews with foreign media in recent months , Netanyahu repeatedly distanced himself from incendiary comments made by Ben-Gvir and Smotrich and members of their parties , such as calling for a & ldquo;voluntary emigration&rdquo ; of Gaza&rsquo;s population or building Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip.Indeed , the prime minister repeatedly argued that all ministers were free to voice their opinions as they saw fit but that the decisions and policies were decided on only in the war cabinet . With the war cabinet now gone , the prime minister will likely find it more difficult to make this argument.Perhaps more significantly , Israel made the same argument in the cases made against it in both the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court at the Hague . Because according to Israeli representatives , statements made by Ben-Gvir , Smotrich , and others were not indicative of official policy , since formal Israeli policies were decided upon within Israel&rsquo;s war cabinet.With the war cabinet gone , remarks by Ben-Gvir and Smotrich could carry more weight and may very possibly negatively affect the ongoing cases against Israel . & nbsp ;",netanyahu dissolves war cabinet : will it change israel's war on hamas ? - analysis
2024-03-31 05:59:49.583,jpost,"The High Court of Justice on Thursday night issued its sensational decision endorsing a universal IDF draft , including the ultra-Orthodox ( haredi ) population , bringing to a theoretical end weeks of squabbling and disagreements.From April 1 , although in reality deferring most enforcement of the ruling until August 9 , the decision largely accepted the recommendation of the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office on invoking a legal universal draft across Israel.As of Monday , some institutions or classes within institutions will already have their funds frozen , but on a larger scale , the freeze won&rsquo;t take effect until August 9.The High Court&rsquo;s decision could also potentially destabilize Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s government if its two haredi parties , United Torah Judaism and Shas , decide to exit the government.Shas chairman MK Aryeh Deri lambasted the decision in a written statement . & ldquo;The interim decision that the High Court of Justice gave to immediately halt the yeshiva funding is a mark of Cain and an unprecedented mistreatment of Torah students in the land of the Jews . & ldquo;Shas will continue to fight for yeshiva students&rsquo ; right to persevere in Torah and will consider its next steps , & rdquo ; Deri added.The Degel Hatorah faction in the United Torah Judaism party expressed outrage at the decision , warning that they would not let it pass without a response . & ldquo;The High Court of Justice and the clerical system have decided on an all-out struggle against Torah scholars and Torah education , and they must prove to everyone that they&rsquo;re in charge in this country , and they will also decide for us which coalition we will go to , & rdquo ; said Degel Hatorah.This comes weeks after Israel&rsquo;s Sefardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef sparked controversy by threatening a mass haredi emigration from the country if the ultra-Orthodox were forced to join the army . "" If they force us to join the army , we will all move abroad , "" Yosef said.The High Court&rsquo;s decision should be applauded as it theoretically brings to some form of closure an issue that has rankled Israeli society for many years . The landmark ruling reflects a principled stance towards ensuring that all citizens contribute to the defense of the nation , while also providing a transition period for adjustments to be made.High Court signals to Israel that no one is exempt from dutyIt sends a clear message that no individual or group should be exempt from their civic duties based on religious or cultural grounds . By endorsing a universal draft , the court has taken a bold step towards fostering a sense of unity and shared sacrifice among all sectors of Israeli society , at a time when the country needs it most . Demographically , the question of haredi enlistment will become even more urgent as the ultra-Orthodox become the dominant population in the country.While there are many more stops along the journey of universal enlistment in Israel&rsquo;s military , the government , the judiciary , and those who are willing to serve , many of whom are religious themselves and Torah students , cannot let themselves be held to ransom by one sector of society that refuses to contribute to the ongoing survival of the country.Israel , unlike many countries around the world , desperately requires its military to survive . The country&rsquo;s very existence depends upon its army , and the ongoing Israel-Hamas War proves how necessary it is.Netanyahu has managed to survive in power despite a tumultuous period , beginning last year with continuous protests against the government's planned judicial reform , an act that was halted when Hamas terrorists crossed the border on October 7 . He has since been dealing with the ongoing military operation in Gaza.It would be ironic if Bibi&rsquo;s bedfellows in government , the ultra-Orthodox parties , were to do what the judicial protests nor the war against Hamas have done and bring the government toppling.The court&rsquo;s ruling should serve as a catalyst for meaningful dialogue and engagement on the issue of military service instead of pathetic threats of emigration and political discord . It creates an opportunity for policymakers , religious leaders , and civil society stakeholders to come together and explore a peaceful solution to the national service question that Israel desperately needs to answer . Quite simply , Israel cannot keep kicking this particular can down the road any further .",the high court's draft decision offers an opportunity for unity and shared sacrifice - editorial

A favorable view toward Palestinians jumped from 46 % to 52 % in the same period.Unfavorable views have declined from 28 % to 25 % toward Israelis , and 45 % to 40 % for Palestinians . Overall , 42 % view both Israelis and Palestinians favorably while 25 % view just Israelis favorably , 10 % view just Palestinians favorably , and 15 % view both unfavorably.Currently , 48 % of Americans view the current Israeli government favorably and 44 % view it unfavorably . In 2019 , 41 % of Americans viewed the Israeli government under Benjamin Netanyahu favorably , and 51 % viewed it negatively.Favorable opinions of Palestinian government have jumped from 19 % in 2019 to 28 % in 2022 . However , the majority of Americans ( 63 % ) still hold unfavorable views toward the Palestinian government despite an improvement from a negative 71 % in 2019.Overall , just 18 % view both governments favorably , compared with 29 % who view just the Israeli government favorably , 10 % just the Palestinian government , and 33 % who view both unfavorably.Demographic divideThe numbers change when accounting for age and political affiliation . Older Americans and those who lean toward the Republican Party tend to view Israelis more positively than younger Americans and those inclined towards the Democrats.Among the under 30s , 56 % view Israelis favorably compared with 78 % who are 65 and older.While 46 % aged 50 + view Palestinians favorably , 61 % under 30 do.Republicans seem to hold Israelis in much higher regard , both as people ( 78 % ) and as government ( 66 % ) than Palestinian people ( 37 % ) and government ( 18 % ) . Democrats , however , tend to incline slightly toward the Palestinians.Around 60 % view Israelis positively and 64 % view Palestinians positively . & nbsp;On the Israeli and Palestinian governments , the numbers are 34 % and 37 % , respectively.Close to half of all Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents view both Israelis and Palestinians positively.Solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflictWhile American views toward Israel and the Palestinians have warmed since 2019 , the best possible outcome to the conflict itself remains a stumbling block.While 35 % support a two-state solution backed by US diplomacy , 27 % back a one-state solution , though 16 % seem to prefer a government that consists of both Israelis and Palestinians , 10 % prefer one headed by an Israeli government , and 2 % say they want a Palestinian-headed government.Still , 37 % say they are unsure what they want , and 1 % have nothing to say.Here , too , older Americans tend to back a two-state solution , while younger adults are more likely to say they aren&rsquo;t sure.Evangelical angleOverall , white evangelical Protestants at 28 % are more likely than other Christians to back a one-state solution headed by an Israeli government , while only 6 % of Catholics , non-Evangelical white Protestants and Black Protestants support that solution.White Evangelicals bring religious motives to their views.Fully 70 % of white Evangelicals believe that God gave the Land of Israel to the Jews , compared with 32 % of US Jews who answered a similar question in a 2020 survey.In addition , 86 % of white Evangelicals have favorable views of Israelis while 37 % view Palestinians favorably.Among atheists , agnostics or other irreligious Americans , Israelis and Palestinians tend to be viewed identically positive at 58 % and 59 % respectively.BDSDespite the media-savvy nature of the BDS movement , relatively few Americans even know about it , and fewer support it.According to Pew , 84 % have heard & ldquo;not much&rdquo ; or & ldquo;nothing at all&rdquo ; about BDS . Just 5 % have heard something about it and support it , with 2 % strongly supporting it.Interestingly , more Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have heard of BDS than Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents who are more likely to support it .","american views on both israelis , palestinians have improved - pew"
2021-05-11 19:30:30.480,jpost,"World leaders are appealing for calm amid the growing violence between Palestinians and Israelis , with the most recent tensions coming to a head on Jerusalem Day . The United States , the European Union and the United Kingdom each chimed in to express their disfavor with the ongoing conflict . The past week has seen hundreds of Palestinians , Israeli police officers and civilians injured . The tensions began with an unresolved Supreme Court dispute surrounding the evictions of four Palestinian families from the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah , known as Shimon Hatzadik in Hebrew . Last week the Palestinian families living in the contested neighborhood gave a response to the court that they will not reach a compromise with the Jewish families attempting to claim the land . Following the recent escalation in violence , the Supreme Court decided to push the ruling off for up until 30 days . The dispute was supposed to be resolved on May 10 . The ruling sparked protests across Jerusalem that soon became violent , eventually spilling over into full-scale riots at al-Aqsa Mosque , culminating in the firing of at least 300 rockets from the Gaza Strip&nbsp;into Israel since Friday & ndash ; with seven of them aimed at Israel @ @ @ s capital Jerusalem & ndash ; and the IDF carrying out a wave of airstrikes targeting 130 terror targets across the Hamas-controlled coastal enclave in response . & quot;This is an unacceptable escalation , & quot ; said US State Department spokesperson Ned Price . & quot;While we urge de-escalation on all sides , we also recognize Israel @ @ @ s legitimate right to defend itself , to defend its people and its territory . & quot ; With the recent uptick in violence between Israelis , Palestinians and the terrorist groups surging to levels that haven @ @ @ t been seen in years , US Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned in the strongest terms the recent barrage of rockets fired into Israel from Gaza . On Monday , Blinken called for the rocket attacks from Gaza against Israel to stop & quot;immediately , & quot ; urging all sides to take the necessary steps to reduce tensions . & quot;We @ @ @ re very focused on the situation in Israel , [ the ] West Bank , Gaza & ndash ; very deeply concerned about the rocket attacks that we @ @ @ re seeing now , that they need to stop & ndash ; they need to stop immediately , & quot ; Blinken said ahead of meeting with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi . The State Department secretary expressed further concerns surrounding the violence and & quot;provocative actions&quot ; in and around Haram al-Sharif , the hilltop compound in the Old City known as the Temple Mount to Jews and the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims , with the State Department adding that it is dedicated to ensuring calm across the region . & quot;The United States will remain fully engaged to promote calm in Jerusalem , and we welcome the steps the Israeli government has taken in recent days aimed at avoiding provocations , including the decision to avoid confrontations during the Jerusalem Day commemoration and the delay in the decision regarding the Sheikh Jarrah evictions . & quot ; For more on Hamas attacks and IDF operations&nbsp;read here For more on rocket attacks against Israel&nbsp;read here For more on Israeli strikes on Gaza&nbsp;read here . For more on world reactions to Gaza violence&nbsp;read here For more on Israeli Politician Gaza reactions&nbsp;read here UK FOREIGN Secretary Dominic Raab said on Monday that the United Kingdom also censures the firing of rockets . & quot;The UK condemns the firing of rockets at Jerusalem and locations within Israel , & quot ; Raab said . & quot;The ongoing violence in Jerusalem and Gaza must stop . & quot;We need an immediate de-escalation on all sides , and an end to the targeting of civilian populations , & quot ; he added . The European Union released a statement , also in condemnation of the rocket fire , hours after its top diplomat came forward to express Europe @ @ @ s hopes for calm after more than 300 Palestinians were hurt in clashes with Israeli police on Monday . & quot;The firing of rockets from Gaza against civilian populations in Israel is totally unacceptable and feeds escalatory dynamics , & quot ; an EU spokesperson said . & quot;All leaders have a responsibility to act against extremists . & quot ; EU Foreign Affairs chief Josep Borrell initially chose to focus on the Sheikh Jarrah evictions before Monday night @ @ @ s rocket barrage , saying that the & quot;situation with regard to evictions of Palestinian families . . . is a matter of serious concern . Such actions are illegal under international humanitarian law and only serve to fuel tensions on the ground . & quot ; After censuring the rocket fire in its most recent statement , the EU re-directed calls at Israel to reduce tensions , adding that the & quot;status quo of the holy sites must be fully respected , & quot ; urging all sides to engage in de-escalatory efforts to prevent further civilian casualties . & quot;The significant upsurge in violence in the occupied West Bank , including in East Jerusalem as well as in and around Gaza needs to stop immediately , & quot ; it added . Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said on Tuesday that the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza were & quot;indiscriminate and irresponsible . & quot ; He said that Israel was responsible for a & quot;dangerous escalation&quot ; in Jerusalem , and called on the international community to act immediately to stop the violence . The attacks in Gaza were a & quot;miserable show of force at the expense of children @ @ @ s blood , & quot ; he added . Arab League foreign ministers are holding a virtual meeting on Tuesday to discuss the situation in Jerusalem . UNITED NATIONS Secretary-General Antonio Guterres shared & quot;his deep concern over the continuing violence in occupied east Jerusalem , as well as the possible evictions of Palestinian families from their homes , & quot ; UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Sunday . Additionally , members of the United Nations Security Council called for further restoration of calm on Monday as the violence between Israelis and Palestinians reached new heights . The UNSC held a closed-door session in New York on Monday to discuss the rising tensions in east Jerusalem , just before Palestinian terror groups in Gaza began launching more rockets at Israel . Diplomats said the briefing was requested by almost two-thirds of the 15-member council & ndash ; Tunisia , Ireland , China , Estonia , France , Norway , Niger , St . Vincent and the Grenadines , and Vietnam . Vietnam , one of the countries who called the meeting , came in with a pre-existing agenda in condemnation of Israel , saying it expressed & ldquo;grave concern , & rdquo ; condemned & ldquo;all acts of violence [ and urged ] all parties to exercise [ maximum ] restraint . & rdquo ; The Vietnam mission also called on Israel to stop settlement activity and to halt & ldquo;forced evictions&rdquo ; of Palestinians and & ldquo;home demolitions . & rdquo ; After the meeting , Norway&rsquo;s mission to the UN tweeted it was & ldquo;critical that political , religious [ and ] other leaders do all they can to de-escalate this volatile situation . & ldquo;All measures aimed at altering the demographic composition , character [ and ] status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967 are illegal , & rdquo ; it added . PALESTINIANS FIRED uninterrupted barrages of rockets into Israel on Monday , and the IDF retaliated by pounding Gaza with airstrikes through the early hours of Tuesday , in a dramatic escalation of clashes in Jerusalem . Explosions shook buildings throughout Gaza and rocket sirens sent Israelis in many southern towns scurrying for shelter overnight . Some 24 Palestinians were killed and more than 103 wounded in airstrikes , Palestinian officials said . Some 31 Israelis were wounded by rockets overnight , Israeli medical officials said . An extra ten were injured during Tuesday morning @ @ @ s rocket barrage , bringing the total to 41 . The events were unleashed by Gaza terrorists firing on the Jerusalem area for the first time since the 2014 war , crossing what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a & quot;redline . & quot ; Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad terrorist group claimed responsibility for the rocket fire on Jerusalem . The upsurge in violence came as Israel celebrated Jerusalem Day , marking its capture of east Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War . Monday @ @ @ s escalations began with confrontations at al-Aqsa , which occurred amid smaller protests and riots spread across the Jerusalem area as well as the rest of the country & ndash ; with the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood being another focal point . Over the course of the day , more than 300 Palestinians were injured in clashes with Israeli police , who fired rubber bullets , stun grenades and tear gas in the Aqsa compound . Police said 21 officers were hurt in the skirmishes . In response to the rocket fire , the IDF said it struck targets that included terrorist operatives , attack tunnels and the home of a Hamas battalion commander . OF THE 24 Palestinians killed on Monday , seven , including three children , were family members who died in an explosion in the town of Beit Hanoun , though it was unclear if it had been caused by an Israeli strike or a Palestinian rocket that had fallen short . The IDF spokesperson said about a third of the Palestinian rockets fired had fallen short and caused damage and casualties inside Gaza . International efforts to appeal for calm are also attempting to incorporate more direct channels of communication with the terrorist cells in Gaza , in hopes the talks will lead to de-escalation . A Palestinian official told Reuters that Egypt , Qatar and the United Nations , which have mediated truces between Israel and Hamas in the past , were in contact with the group @ @ @ s leader Ismail Haniyeh . Hamas allegedly warned Egyptian officials overnight that the Gaza terrorist groups will refuse negotiations for a ceasefire until Israel removes its security forces from Sheikh Jarrah and the Temple Mount , as well release all those detained in the clashes taking place across east Jerusalem and the West Bank , according to a report by the London-based Saudi newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed . The IDF expressed similar sentiments , claiming it is not interested in a ceasefire at the moment , with the IDF spokesperson stating in response to questions about a possible ceasefire : & quot;Talk to the Palestinians . I know nothing about that . & quot ; Tovah Lazaroff and Reuters contributed to this report .","world leaders urge calm amid growing violence between israelis , palestinians"
2023-05-10 01:34:50.123,jpost,"Israel thwarted an attempted by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) terrorist cell to produce rockets and a launcher in the Jenin refugee camp in the northern West Bank in recent weeks , Shin Bet head Ronen Bar revealed during a press conference on Tuesday evening.Bar stressed that Tareq Ezzaldin , a spokesperson for the PIJ who was assassinated by the IDF in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday morning , had been attempting to replicate terrorist capabilities in Gaza to the West Bank and Israel.According to Bar , Ezzaldin directly organized 20 terrorist cells who aimed to murder Israelis , including the cell who attempted to produce rockets . Ezzaldin provided the cells with knowledge and funding . "" We have no intention of turning Afula or Shaked into a target for indirect fire , "" said the Shin Bet chief . "" Most of the activity to thwart these cells is not known to the public , but it is known to us and the risk is known to us and illustrated every day . "" Ezzaldin additionally recruited a number of individuals from the Ramallah area and provided them with funds to purchase weapons , including a quadcopter to use in attacks against Israeli civilians . The terrorist cell recruited by Ezzaldin was arrested , thwarting the attack.Bar stressed that these thwarted cells are just a few examples of Ezzaldin's "" terrorist enterprise , "" adding "" we have no intention of waiting defensively for threats , but are always acting on the offensive against those sending them , in the Kasbah in Nablus , as happened again this morning , in Gaza City and anywhere else in the Middle East . "" "" It is important to say , the PIJ is an organization that is fully funded by Iran . The hands are the hands of Palestinians , the voice is the voice of Iran , "" added Bar.Operation Shield and Arrow continuesBar's statements came during a press conference after a meeting of the security cabinet concerning Operation Shield and Arrow , which broke out after the IDF assassinated three senior PIJ terrorists in Gaza on Tuesday morning.The senior terrorists assassinated in the IDF strikes included : Ezzaldin , Khalil Bahitini , the commander of the al-Quds Brigades in the northern Gaza Strip , and Jihad Ghanem , secretary of the movement's military council.They were all killed almost simultaneously , within minutes of each other , by a mix of around 40 aircraft and drones .",israel thwarted attempt to produce rockets in jenin - shin bet chief
2023-05-10 15:44:33.133,jpost,"Around the Gaza Strip , the morning of the second day of Operation Shield and Arrow began quietly . Communities were told to either go to shelters or remain close by . I drove south from Jerusalem , a drive that took about an hour and a half . The police and army had closed off some areas around the Strip . Traffic from Ashkelon was blocked to Sderot , as these areas were expected to be under direct threat , which extended dozens of kilometers inland.When I arrived on the border , it was still quiet , without much traffic . There are still industries operating around the border , so there are many people who have to use the roads . I had been in this area many times before during numerous conflicts over the last two decades . Most of the landscape is fields , and there were a few soldiers who had set up a checkpoint south of Ashkelon near Yad Mordechai and the turnoff to Karmiya.I drove out toward Karmiya and Zikim Beach until there were more roadblocks . Then I paused and wondered what would come next . The radio said people could leave their shelters . Israel had carried out strikes against sites in Khan Yunis and Beit Lahiya . I could see smoke rising from Beit Lahiya . As I began to drive back towards a hill that overlooks the border area , I could see streaks of white smoke rising from Gaza . These are the telltale signs of rockets . Soon , Iron Dome was at work overhead , its Tamir interceptor missiles flying toward the rockets.The rocket fire beginsThis was just the opening salvo of a long series of salvos that poured missiles over our heads . It began at 1:27 p.m . and continued at 1:30 p.m . , 1:35 p.m . and every five or 10 minutes after that until a brief lull at 2:30 p.m . , before restarting around 3 p.m . , when more rockets were fired toward areas south of Tel Aviv . The rockets were intercepted by Iron Dome in dozens of interceptions.Each of these salvos and the interceptors heading toward them could be seen from areas south of Ashkelon . The rocket fire was concentrated here . Smoke filled the skies and slowly drifted away with each round of interceptions . Some rockets fell in open areas nearby , and smoke rose from the fields.IDF air defenses are seen intercepting rockets fired from Gaza into Israel , on May 10 , 2023 ( video credit : Seth J . Frantzman)Inside Gaza , loud booms indicated that Israel was responding . The radio continued to say where the sirens were sounding and to encourage people to go to their shelters . In many areas along the roads , there are no shelters , so cars had to brave the roads south of Ashkelon with nothing more to do than keep driving.The number of salvos in broad daylight took place as they have in the past . However , standing under the missiles fired from Gaza and the Iron Dome interceptors was still jarring . There were sirens in the distance , but in some areas , there are no sirens , and therefore you can be standing outside and suddenly see small bright lights tailed by smoke rising into the area from Iron Dome interceptors heading to stop the missiles.As the afternoon continued , it appeared that Islamic Jihad began to use its longer-range rockets , firing them toward areas in the center of the country , such as Rishon Lezion , as well as other areas , such as Netivot . Border areas were spared some of the rockets , as they flew high up in the air , way above the few residents who remained near the border.Nevertheless , for many of those working industries near the border , or living in the larger towns such as Sderot , there was nowhere to go . Most of them are used to the situation . Trucks continued to go back and forth from industrial areas , and civilians continued to drive on the most essential roads.I drove over to the industrial area south of Ashkelon , where several roads stretch into the distance , toward the sea , the Rutenberg Power Station and Zikim Beach . As I drove , I could hear sirens , and the radio was saying there were rockets headed for Ashkelon . The loud screams of Iron Dome interceptors grasping upward led me to look toward the coast , where the battle overhead was taking place between Islamic Jihad rockets and Iron Dome . The interceptors did their work . I tried to get a better vantage point , but there were roadblocks.I know this area well because I&rsquo;ve covered wars here since 2009&rsquo;s Operation Cast Lead . The names of the operations fade with time & ndash ; Pillar of Defense , Defensive Edge , Black Belt , Guardian of the Walls , Breaking Dawn . It has been two years since Guardian began in this same area . It was back in 2014 that Hamas tried to infiltrate terrorists near here in the dunes near Zikim . And in September 2014 , Avera Mengistu , an Israeli man , crossed into Gaza near here and is still being held by Hamas . I thought of those experiences as I drove back toward Ashkelon.The overall sense is that we&rsquo;ve been here before . This time , the local authorities and home front were quick to encourage people to go into shelters , and children were mostly moved from smaller border communities , while adults stayed home from work in the cities . In Ashkelon , the malls were closed , for instance . Most of the streets were quiet . Most playgrounds were empty , except one that had two kids and their father on it.The rockets had peaked in the early afternoon , and then there were several more salvos through sunset , when rumors of a ceasefire seemed to encourage Islamic Jihad to fire wildly at cities far from Gaza . Israel&rsquo;s operations against the terrorist group continue frequently , but it&rsquo;s unclear if this has become routine & ndash ; a choreographed series of events where a ceasefire will result , but both sides know the next round is soon . The radio programs playing as I drove back to Jerusalem all seemed cynical ; it was only a matter of time until the next round of rockets and airstrikes .",on the gaza border : rockets fly over israelis ' heads - reporter's notebook

A very large public feels that we are beginning to trod in place , we must invest in creative thinking to change how the war is conducted . We will fight for this change to happen . & rdquo;Elkin said that the name of the new party will be called & ldquo;Hayamin Hamamlachti , & rdquo ; which translates roughly as the & ldquo;Statesmanlike Right . & rdquo ; However , a spokesperson for Sa&rsquo;ar said the name in English will continue to be New Hope until a formal translation is announced.MK Pnina Tamano-Shata of National Unity said at the committee meeting that the split was & ldquo;a divorce that was known in advance , & rdquo ; as the two factions ran in the election as separate entities in the same list , and never actually merged.Gantz was unaware of Sa'ar's timingNational Unity head Gantz acknowledged in a press conference earlier on Wednesday that there were & ldquo;challenges in the government&rsquo;s conduct , & rdquo ; and that & ldquo;real operational needs and correct priorities were being harmed as a result of political conduct , & rdquo ; but said that & ldquo;now was not the time for politics . & ldquo;Now we must concentrate on the unifying , [ on what&rsquo;s ] correct , and victory . When the war ends , we will go to an election . Anyone who runs will explain what he&rsquo;s proposing , and what he did during this difficult time for the country , & rdquo ; Gantz said.Gantz&rsquo;s responses during the question-and-answer session that followed his statement were uncharacteristically curt . He said that he was not aware of Sa&rsquo;ar&rsquo;s plan to announce the secession on Tuesday evening , but that he did know about Sa&rsquo;ar&rsquo;s plans in general.He added that & ldquo;Sa&rsquo;ar&rsquo;s decision to go on his path is his decision . We will find ways to put out a list as good as ours and even bigger but of no less quality . We will do this the correct way , & rdquo ; Gantz said.In his speech on Tuesday evening , Sa&rsquo;ar explained that his decision to split from Gantz was due to what he claimed was the latter&rsquo;s unwillingness to ramp up operations in Gaza and to achieve the war&rsquo;s goal of completely eradicating Hamas . & ldquo;For a long time , my friends and I have not hidden our criticism of the campaign&rsquo;s navigation by the reduced [ war ] cabinet , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar said . He also demanded to become a member of the war cabinet himself.Gantz said in response on Wednesday that & ldquo;what isn&rsquo;t broken doesn&rsquo;t need fixing , & rdquo ; and there was no reason to bring Sa&rsquo;ar into the war cabinet.Sa&rsquo;ar responded to Gantz shortly afterward in a post on X . & ldquo;I chose to separate from Gantz respectfully .

2024-03-29 10:44:02.150,jpost,"Israel should put forward its own ceasefire plan calling for the exile of Hamas leadership and military wing in exchange for the release of the hostages , United Right Party leader Gideon Sa&rsquo;ar told The Jerusalem Post as he laid out three mistakes Israel has made in conducting the Gaza war . & ldquo;We always return to the same ineffective ideas wrapped in bombastic statements that won&rsquo;t lead to victory . The time has come for new ideas , & rdquo ; he said.The veteran politician , who is a fierce opponent of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , quit the government this week , after making a failed bid to be included in the war cabinet.He had entered the government together with the National Unity Party at the start of the war to make a difference , but once he understood that was not possible , he left , in a move that was symbolic of the political turmoil , but which barely dented the coalition&rsquo;s governing capacity , bringing it down from 76 to 72 seats . & ldquo;We are stuck in every direction . We are stuck in Gaza . We are stuck on the Lebanese border . We are stuck with the hostages , and we are stuck in the international arena , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar explained , as he sat in his office in the Knesset wearing a suit and tie.He arrived late to the interview due to a vote in the plenum and left in the middle to participate in a second vote . He spoke in a week of high tension between Israel and the United States and amid increased international pressure on Israel to agree to a permanent ceasefire , and if not , to at least pause hostilities until the end of Ramadan on April 9 . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that the world wants [ Israel ] to end the war . It&rsquo;s clear that the US administration , for all kinds of reasons , wants the war to be over . So Israel has to stand [ alone ] against everyone . & ldquo;But you can minimize the dispute with a better handling of the issues that cause us problems and with [ the initiation of ] more proactive policies , & rdquo ; he stated.Three errors Israel should correct in GazaSA&rsquo;AR FOCUSED on three errors Israel should correct in Gaza , now that the war sparked by Hamas&rsquo;s invasion of Israel on October 7 will soon hit the half-year mark.The first , he said , he put on the table already in October . He called for the & ldquo;surrender and exile of the Hamas military wing and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad from Gaza to countries friendly to them : Syria , Turkey , Qatar , and Iran . & rdquo;The hostages would be freed in conjunction , and the deal could also include an Israeli agreement to release some Palestinian security prisoners and terrorists , he said.The framing of the idea , he said , should be that it is Israel&rsquo;s ceasefire proposal , rather than perpetually being in the position of appearing to object to a halt to the war.It also works as an answer to the international objections to Israel&rsquo;s pending military operation in Rafah to destroy the remaining Hamas battalions.The & ldquo;argument against it would be that Hamas won&rsquo;t agree to it . That is probably correct , & rdquo ; he said , & ldquo;at least not at this moment . & ldquo;But at least we can tell the world and say , & lsquo;We want to enter Rafah , but we do not have to . & rsquo ; If this [ Hamas surrender and exile plan ] happens , then we can end the war . You say you want a ceasefire . You want to end Hamas&rsquo;s governance [ of Gaza ] . Well , here is a pragmatic idea that also ends the humanitarian suffering caused by the war , & rdquo ; he stated.This framing helps put the onus on Hamas for the failure to achieve a ceasefire , he explained . & ldquo;It gives us more legitimization with our friends , and then , if there are no other options , & rdquo ; Israel can explain that it has to finish the war because Hamas won&rsquo;t agree to end it , Sa&rsquo;ar said.His second issue dealt with the failures around the delivery of humanitarian assistance , for which Israel did not provide options effectively and quickly enough.Sa&rsquo;ar spoke amid a bitter dispute between Israel and the international community on the issue of humanitarian assistance , with the United Nations and the European Union accusing Israel of creating starvation conditions in Gaza.Israel has said that more than enough aid enters Gaza , but that the UN and international organizations have failed to properly distribute it.The army should have seized control of the situation from the start and created a humanitarian administration to ensure the distribution of food and the provision of water and basic sanitation , Sa&rsquo;ar said.The international community would still provide the aid and be involved , but the army would have oversight to make sure that delivery is successful . & ldquo;I know the army doesn&rsquo;t love this , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar said , acknowledging that there are some risks with the plan , which could lead to increased friction between the IDF and Palestinian civilians in Gaza.It&rsquo;s a plan that also tackles some of the governance vacuum created by the IDF&rsquo;s military campaign against Hamas , which partially but not completely eliminated the terrorist group&rsquo;s forced rule of the enclave.Until Hamas is destroyed , there can&rsquo;t be an alternative government in Gaza , Sa&rsquo;ar said , adding that IDF control of the distribution of basic services , in partnership with international organizations , is the only smart option that can prevent the terrorist group&rsquo;s return.If the IDF had taken charge of issues of food , water , medicine , and sanitation , Israel would have a better & ldquo;standing in the international community , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar stressed.His third point , Sa&rsquo;ar said , is that the war has to proceed at a quicker pace for the sake of Israel&rsquo;s economy , its international standing , and the looming threat of an all-out war with Hezbollah in the north . & ldquo;We have always known that we needed to wage the war as quickly as possible , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;It is hard for us to wage long-term wars . & rdquo;Some thought that the international community would lose interest in the war as time went on , Sa&rsquo;ar explained , adding that he always believed Israel had a tight timeline for the war . & ldquo;It was clear from the start that this idea was mistaken . We can&rsquo;t drag on the war forever , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;As long as you haven&rsquo;t ended the Gaza war , you can&rsquo;t deal with Hezbollah , & rdquo ; he added.Hezbollah has to withdraw from the border , he said , as he referenced diplomatic efforts to ensure that it complies with Resolution 1701 , which set out the ceasefire terms that ended the Second Lebanon War in 2006.Only then can the residents in communities along that border , who were evacuated at the start of the Gaza war when violence broke out simultaneously with Lebanon , return home.In the end , they will return home . & ldquo;It has to happen , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar stressed , but that he hopes Israel will do it through diplomacy and not through a full-scale war.Sa'ar : A Palestinian state is a danger to IsraelSA&rsquo;AR , WHO began his political life in the Likud in 2003 , and formed his own party , initially called New Hope , in 2020 , does not disagree with all of Netanyahu&rsquo;s policies.He has always been opposed to the creation of a Palestinian state , even more so now in the aftermath of October 7 . & ldquo;A Palestinian state is a danger to Israel , to its security , and it is not a & lsquo;maybe&rsquo ; danger ; it&rsquo;s a clear danger . The creation of a Palestinian state would allow them to continue their war to destroy Israel from an improved position . & rdquo ; It would & ldquo;strengthen those Palestinian forces who believe that war brings results . & rdquo;Israel has to work to prevent Palestinian statehood , he said . It can take a positive stance on other issues regarding the Palestinians , but it can&rsquo;t allow itself to go in this direction.Should the Palestinian Authority be reformed , such that it stops its monthly payments to terrorists jailed by Israel and the incitement in its education system , then it could be possible to advance in certain areas , he said.Sa&rsquo;ar said he stands with Netanyahu in opposing the return of the PA to Gaza . He has also supported many of the stances Netanyahu has taken in the international arena , including in his relationship with the United States . & ldquo;Netanyahu is acting to preserve Israel&rsquo;s international interests in this war , and in most of the situations when he fought with the US , I thought he was right , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar explained . & ldquo;Historically , prime ministers have been at odds with supportive US presidents during a war , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar said , as he recalled the diplomatic battles between former prime minister Menachem Begin and former US president Ronald Reagan during the First Lebanon War.He pointed to the most recent battle between Jerusalem and Washington over the Biden administration&rsquo;s failure on Monday to veto a UN Security Council resolution that called for a temporary pause to the war , without tying it to the release of any of the remaining 134 hostages in Gaza.Before the UNSC vote , Netanyahu threatened that if the US didn&rsquo;t use its veto , he wouldn&rsquo;t send a high-level delegation to Washington for a scheduled meeting . After the vote , Netanyahu held to his word but has since backed down and is looking to dispatch the delegation to the US next week.It was a mistake for Netanyahu to attempt to back the US into a corner , and it didn&rsquo;t increase the chances of a veto , Sa&rsquo;ar said.Netanyahu should have kept his objections private , but essentially he was correct that the vote was bad for Israel , Sa&rsquo;ar said.The issue here is one of style , he explained.Netanyahu has & ldquo;to know how to stand strong with friends , but to do it when it is essential , and to do it in a respectful way , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar said.He himself has a long history of standing on principle and was one of the group of what was known as the & ldquo;Likud rebels&rdquo ; who opposed former prime minister Ariel Sharon&rsquo;s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005 and the destruction of the 21 settlements there.Sa&rsquo;ar recalled how he had argued with former foreign minister Tzipi Livni , who was then in Sharon&rsquo;s government , about the Disengagement . She had contended that the withdrawal would legitimize Israel&rsquo;s right to self-defense against the Palestinians , Sa&rsquo;ar recalled . He had disputed that.History has shown , Sa&rsquo;ar said , that & ldquo;I was correct . & rdquo ;","israel needs gaza ceasefire plan exiling hamas , gideon sa'ar tells ' post ' - interview"
2024-05-19 17:15:47.653,jpost,"Garfield , that lazy , lasagna-loving cat , is back , in The Garfield Movie , which opened throughout Israel this week , and this ferociously selfish feline may be just the character we need to spend a couple of hours with right now.The movie , which did not have advance screenings prior to press time , is the latest screen portrayal of the surly pet.Those who like to take their children to English-language movies rather than dubbed versions of animated movies are in luck , because this is being released in theaters in two versions , one dubbed into Hebrew and one in English with Hebrew titles , probably because Garfield movies tend to appeal to adults as well as kids.There&rsquo;s something liberating and almost politically incorrect about seeing a character as gluttonous , lazy , and bossy as Garfield . Other than James Bond when he&rsquo;s not on a mission , what character gets to do what he wants to do all day , every day ? Right , only Garfield.This time , sadly , Bill Murray , who voiced the cantankerous cat in the 2004 Garfield movie and in 2006&rsquo;s Garfield : A Tail of Two Kitties , is not around . Murray&rsquo;s vaguely hostile hipster persona was perfect for the character . This time , Chris Pratt voices a slightly less cynical , slightly more energetic-sounding Garfield.The new film is all animated , unlike the previous two , in which Garfield was animated and digitally inserted into live-action scenes.The plotWe learn how Jon Arbuckle ( Nicholas Hoult , who made his big-screen debut over 20 years ago , playing the teen who befriends Hugh Grant in About a Boy ) first met his very prideful pet . Jon was having a slice of pizza in a restaurant when he saw Garfield , then a kitten , looking pitiful outside . Jon invited him in , and Garfield consumed the pizza and everything not nailed down.This film features the usual Garfield antics , but then gets into a plot that tells the story of how Garfield gets back in touch with his father , a scruffy alley cat named Vic , voiced by Samuel L . Jackson , of Pulp Fiction and so many other movies . & ldquo;I&rsquo;m mixed up with some bad cats , and I need your help , & rdquo ; says Vic.Garfield replies , & ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen you for years , and when I do , you pull me into a life of crime . & rdquo;Vic asks if he has ever jumped a train , to which Garfield responds , & ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never jumped . & rdquo;Vic is being blackmailed by his former associate , Jinx ( Hannah Waddington of Ted Lasso ) , and he wants to pay her to leave him alone so he can concentrate on his next heist : a large-scale robbery of Lactose Farms , after which he promises they will be set for life.Liz , Jon&rsquo;s sometime girlfriend and Garfield&rsquo;s veterinarian , is played by Dev Joshi . Ving Rhames ( who played Jackson&rsquo;s gangster boss in Pulp Fiction ) and Cecily Strong of SNL portray characters who get mixed up in the heist , while rapper Snoop Dog voices a character called Snoop Cat.If you&rsquo;d like to see the older versions of Garfield , you can watch The Garfield Show , a series from about 15 years ago , on Netflix . The two Bill Murray movies are available on Disney + and Apple TV + . Garfield started out as a comic strip , created by Jim Davis , that was published in an Indiana newspaper in the late & rsquo;70s and was originally called Jon.Raised on an Indiana farm with 25 cats , Davis later worked in advertising and created the comic strip , thinking at first that readers would connect to stories of the nebbishy Jon , but everyone loved Garfield so much that he quickly had to change the name and the focus of the comic , admitting that Garfield had turned out to be his boss . Soon , the cartoon was syndicated in thousands of newspapers and now is also available online at Garfield.com / . Davis attributes some of its success to the fact that it is apolitical . & ldquo;My grasp of politics isn&rsquo;t strong , & rdquo ; he admitted in an interview.While the movies always have a fairly complicated plot , children seeing them tend to respond most strongly to the silly stuff , like Jon giving the scowling Garfield a bath and blow-drying his fur . And there looks to be enough of that here to keep them amused .",garfield is back and bigger than ever - film review
2022-04-20 20:35:59.463,jpost,"For Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , the events of the past week in Jerusalem have been both a blessing and a curse.On the one hand , he managed to get Israel into trouble with many countries by portraying it as the & ldquo;aggressor . & rdquo;On the other hand , what happened at al-Aqsa Mosque compound ( Temple Mount ) has emboldened his rivals in Hamas and other extremist groups , showing that they have more influence and support in Jerusalem than the PA or Jordan.The violence that erupted at the Temple Mount last Friday brought the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back to the center of the world&rsquo;s attention , which has been almost entirely focused on the Russian invasion of Ukraine since February . This came as good news for Abbas.Since the Ukraine war began , Palestinian officials in Ramallah have been working hard to redirect the international community&rsquo;s attention toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . Their major concern was that Israel would exploit the world&rsquo;s preoccupation with the war to impose new facts on the ground , especially in Jerusalem and its Islamic holy sites . But in the past week these officials have expressed satisfaction with the wide coverage the violence in Jerusalem received in the international media.Abbas and his aides were even more delighted to see the large number of condemnations of Israel , in particular those coming from Arab and Islamic countries.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken&rsquo;s phone call to his Jordanian counterpart , during which he & ldquo;emphasized the importance of upholding the historic status quo at the Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount , & rdquo ; was also received with deep satisfaction in Ramallah and Amman . Abbas was also happy to receive a phone call from Blinken with a similar message.Ever since the resumption of Jewish visits to the Temple Mount several years ago , the PA leadership has been accusing Israel of waging & ldquo;religious war&rdquo ; on the Muslims.The accusation , which continues to this day , aims to rally as many Arabs and Muslims as possible against Israel . The visits of the Jews are portrayed by Palestinian and Jordanian officials and media outlets as violent incursions by extremist settlers under the protection of the Israel Police.Yet , the allegations failed to achieve their goal , as the reactions of most Arabs and Muslims have remained limited to lip service.Scenes of Palestinians burning flags and photos of Arab leaders engaged in normalization with Israel managed to enrage many Arabs , especially those residing in the Gulf states . Those Arabs were further enraged when they saw Palestinians curse and harass Emirati and Bahraini visitors to the Temple Mount.The Abraham Accords , which were signed between Israel and a number of Arab countries , as well as the apparent rapprochement between Israel and Saudi Arabia , left the Palestinians with the impression that the Arabs and Muslims do not really care about Israel&rsquo;s ostensible scheme to change the status quo at the Temple Mount by allocating time and space for Jewish prayer there.That&rsquo;s why Palestinian officials in Ramallah were pleased this week to see the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain and Saudi Arabia condemn & ldquo;the Israel Police&rsquo;s storming of al-Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; These officials , however , are aware that the UAE and Bahrain are not going to take drastic measures , such as recalling their ambassadors from Israel.By contrast , the PA leadership appears to be content with the crisis that erupted this week between Israel and Jordan in the aftermath of the violence at the Temple Mount.Since the beginning of the tensions at the holy site , the PA and Jordan have been holding intensive discussions on & ldquo;defending&rdquo ; al-Aqsa Mosque and & ldquo;thwarting&rdquo ; Israel&rsquo;s alleged attempt to alter the status quo . The feeling in Ramallah is that the Jordanians are the only ones who are siding with the Palestinians . & ldquo;The State of Palestine commended the courageous Jordanian stances expressed by King Abdullah of Jordan and the Jordanian government , parliament and people in defending Jerusalem and the Christian and Islamic holy sites , & rdquo ; the PA said in a statement issued by its foreign ministry . & ldquo;The State of Palestine and its people highly appreciate the diplomatic activity led by King Abdullah to expose the Israeli aggression on al-Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo;THE PA and Jordan , nonetheless , have good reason to be worried about the events of the past week . The violence that erupted at the Temple Mount has shown that Ramallah and Amman have little influence , if any , over the young men and women who clashed with the Israeli security forces.The Jordanian-controlled Wakf Islamic religious trust , which is responsible for administering the Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem , failed to stop dozens of rioters from entering the mosque with stones and fireworks . The Wakf has dozens of security guards stationed at the Temple Mount , but they did not intervene to stop the rioters and thugs from sneaking into the mosque.Similarly , the PA , which has its own supporters and representatives at the Temple Mount , did not do anything to stop the rioters from storming into al-Aqsa Mosque with a large cache of stones and other objects.On the eve of Ramadan , some Israeli and US officials approached the PA and Jordan and asked them to work toward preventing an outbreak of violence in Jerusalem , particularly the Temple Mount.But instead of appealing for calm , Ramallah and Amman ramped up their rhetorical attacks on Israel , warning that allowing Jews to enter the Temple Mount would ignite & ldquo;religious war&rdquo ; and plunge the entire region into a fresh cycle of violence.The PA and Jordan do not feel comfortable admitting that supporters of Hamas and other extremist groups are the ones who call the shots at the Temple Mount . It&rsquo;s easier for Ramallah and Amman to hold Israel solely responsible for the violence than denounce the rioters who desecrated al-Aqsa Mosque . In fact , the PA and Jordan seem to have scored a diplomatic and propaganda achievement by convincing many in the international community that it was Israel that planned and initiated the violence.While the violence seems to have served Abbas&rsquo;s goal of shifting the blame toward Israel , he nevertheless appears worried that he was excluded from the first stage of the mediation efforts to restore calm.Instead of talking to Abbas , the Egyptians , Qataris and the United Nations chose to negotiate with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , who is based in Qatar.According to Palestinian sources , Abbas was & ldquo;furious&rdquo ; for being sidelined by the mediators , mainly because this allows Hamas to score more points with the Palestinian public and gain more legitimacy in the international arena.Abdullah , for his part , is worried that the violence at the Temple Mount and the rising tensions with Israel could cost the Hashemites their status as custodians of the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem . He is well aware that Palestinian teenagers hurling stones at Israeli police officers have more influence than his Wakf in Jerusalem . But that does not mean that the monarch is prepared to walk away from the city.In recent years , reports have surfaced that Israel may allow Saudi Arabia and other Arab and Islamic countries to replace the Hashemites as the sole custodians of the holy sites . The reports are said to have angered Abdullah , who has since been making a huge effort to reassert the royal family&rsquo;s role in tending the Islamic and Christian holy sites in Jerusalem . He does not seem to be worried if Hamas presents itself as the & ldquo;defender&rdquo ; of Jerusalem , as long as that does not affect the Hashemites&rsquo ; status as & ldquo;custodians&rdquo ; of the holy sites.Like Abbas , Abdullah is also worried about the increasing role Hamas and other Islamist groups are playing at the Temple Mount.Videos and photos featuring rioters wrapped in Hamas flags and chanting slogans in support of Hamas arch-terrorist Mohammed Deif over the past week have undoubtedly left Abdullah perturbed . Still , he does not seem to be worried if Hamas presents itself as the & ldquo;defender&rdquo ; of Jerusalem , as long as that does not affect the Hashemites&rsquo ; status as & ldquo;custodians&rdquo ; of the holy sites.In Ramallah , PA officials were also unhappy to see the Hamas supporters leading the riots.THERE&rsquo;S NO doubt that the inflammatory statements that came from Ramallah and Amman before and during the events of the past week served the interests of Hamas and other extremists in orchestrating the riots at the Temple Mount.Abbas and Abdullah would have been happy to see the rioters raise their photos ; instead , they got Hamas banners and flags , and were forced to watch and hear Palestinians calling on the Gaza-based terrorist groups to fire rockets at Israel.Now , it appears that Abbas and Abdullah are desperately trying to extinguish the very fire they helped ignite , not out of concern for Israel&rsquo;s security , but out of fear of being totally removed from the holy site.But because they don&rsquo;t dare to speak out against the young men and women who have turned al-Aqsa Mosque into a battlefield and spoiled the Ramadan celebrations and prayers for hundreds of thousands of Muslim worshippers , the current strategy of the PA and Jordan is to get the international community to exert pressure on Israel to halt Jewish & ldquo;provocations . & rdquo;Even if the situation does calm down after Ramadan ends ( as expected ) , it&rsquo;s evident that the status quo has indeed shifted at the Temple Mount.But it&rsquo;s not Israel that has changed the status quo ; rather , it&rsquo;s the shabab ( youths ) and Hamas who have managed to create a new reality in which they are now the & ldquo;custodians&rdquo ; and & ldquo;defenders&rdquo ; of al-Aqsa Mosque . & bull ;",temple mount tensions further embolden hamas
2024-04-26 05:34:59.993,jpost,"Hamas , through a senior official , stated its readiness to enter a cease-fire of five years or more with Israel and transition into a political entity if an independent Palestinian state is established along pre-1967 borders . The official , Khalil al-Hayya , considered Sinwar&rsquo;s right hand , expressed these views during a recent interview amidst stalled cease-fire negotiations . & nbsp;Al-Hayya indicated this would only be a temporary stance until Palestinians retain their & ldquo;historic right to all Palestinian lands . & rdquo ; The Palestinian politician suggested Hamas ' willingness to join the Palestine Liberation Organization and form a unified government for Gaza and the West Bank and the dissolution of its military wing . Despite the devastation caused by recent hostilities , Al-Hayya dismissed Israeli attempts to eradicate Hamas but spoke about a possible truce soon . & nbsp;Dr . Ghassan Khatib , a lecturer at Birzeit&rsquo;s University and former minister of labor for the Palestinian Authority , provided his perspective to The Media Line . "" It's worth waiting to see if this statement reflects a significant shift , "" he noted , highlighting a common inconsistency between individual remarks by Hamas leaders and the group's official stance.Dr . Khatib further explained the internal dynamics within Hamas : "" The statement can also reflect dissent and the debate within Hamas . Different leaders have different views , but it could also be a tactic , considering the imminent threat of the Israeli army to enter Rafah . "" & nbsp;He added that while the promise to dissolve the military wing and pursue a sovereign state was notable , "" Hamas being willing to put its guns down isn&rsquo;t something you hear every day . Dissolving the military wing of Hamas and falling in line with a Sovereign Palestinian State on the 1967 borders would bring a powerful change . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Whatever the reasons they make this statement now , it&rsquo;s important to dialogue with Hamas because they are a very relevant part of Palestinian internal politics . Whether the Israelis like it or not , that&rsquo;s the fact . Even if the statement made by Al-Hayya has conditions unlikely to be accepted by Israel , it is important to continue the dialogue , and this is also true for America and other Western countries , & rdquo ; he concluded.Natural skepticismWhile Dr . Khatib emphasizes the importance of dialogue with Hamas despite skepticism about their intentions , some suggest a more cautious perspective , questioning the sincerity of Hamas ' statements and suggesting that their motives may be influenced by the immediate threat of Israeli military action.Chuck Freilich , former deputy national security adviser and senior fellow in INSS , told The Media Line , & ldquo;Hamas is aware of its imminent demise if the IDF enters Rafah . Making remarkable statements , such as the one made by Al-Hayya , gives them more time and feeds into the narrative believed by their supporters worldwide . Still , Israeli leaders should pursue this dialogue in the future if we have a different government . & rdquo ; & ldquo;If this statement made by Al-Hayya is serious , then they should be open to dialogue after the Israeli conducts its plans to go into Rafah . It's doubtful that Israel would entertain such dialogue , as it remains committed to dismantling Hamas . After Hamas is removed from Rafah , then the Palestinians should announce an initiative with their top leaders or with a formal declaration , & rdquo ; concluded Chuck Freilich.While Hamas has previously maintained a hardline stance against Israel , this shift towards a potential two-state solution represents a notable concession . However , it remains unclear if this signifies a permanent resolution to the conflict or merely an interim step toward Hamas ' longstanding goal of Israel's destruction . & nbsp;Israel nor the Palestinian Authority have yet to comment .","dissolving hamas ' military , forming sovereign palestinian state would bring ‘ change ’ - expert"

2023-02-06 18:22:05.773,jpost,"Hamas and a number of Palestinian armed groups vowed on Monday to avenge the death of five gunmen killed by Israeli security forces during a raid on Aqbat Jaber Refugee Camp , located on the outskirts of Jericho.The five , identified by Hamas as Malek Lafi , 22 , Ra&rsquo;fat Oweidat , 21 , Ibrahim Oweidat , 27 , Thaer Oweidat , 28 , and Adham Oweidat , 22 , belonged to the group&rsquo;s armed wing , Izaddin al-Qassam.Palestinian sources said the gunmen operated in the camp under the name of a group called Aqbat Jaber Camp Battalion.A new armed Palestinian gunmen group has formed in JerichoThe new group , the first of its kind in the Jericho area , is seen by the sources as part of an attempt to imitate similar militias that have been operating in the northern West Bank over the past year : Jenin Battalion , Nablus Battalion and Balata Refugee Camp Battalion , as well as the Lions&rsquo ; Den and Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades.While these groups consist mostly of members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) and the ruling Fatah faction headed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , the slain Aqbat Jaber cell members all belonged to Hamas.Two of the gunmen were involved in a shooting attack on January 28 against an Israeli-owned caf&eacute ; at Almog junction , located only a few kilometers away from Aqbat Jaber Refugee Camp . No one was hurt.Since the attack , the IDF has imposed strict security measures in the Jericho area , a move that badly hurt the local economy , which relies mainly on local tourism.The camp is located across the street from the Oasis Casino , the first gambling facility in the West Bank . The casino has been shut since the start of the Second Intifada more than 20 years ago . Some of the camp residents previously worked in the casino and a nearby hotel.Last year , unconfirmed reports claimed that Israel and the Palestinians were discussing the possibility of allowing the casino to reopen . The reports revived hopes in Aqbat Jaber camp in particular and Jericho in general that the local economy would be strengthened once the gamblers , most of whom were Israeli citizens , returned to the casino.Despite the closure of the casino , Jericho has over the past few years witnessed an unprecedented boom in local tourism as dozens of luxurious villas have popped up in and around the city . In addition , many foreign tourists have returned to the city in recent years.The villas , owned by Arab Israelis and residents of east Jerusalem , are offered for rent on a daily , weekly and monthly basis . Most of the clients are Palestinian families from east Jerusalem and the West Bank , as well as Arab Israelis . & ldquo;The streets of Jericho were empty after the shooting operation [ at the Almog junction ] , & rdquo ; said a resident of east Jerusalem who owns two villas in Jericho . & ldquo;Many people couldn&rsquo;t go to Jericho because of the Israeli checkpoints . People rent the villas for private events , including birthday parties and weddings . & rdquo;He and other Palestinians who own businesses in Jericho expressed fear that the phenomenon of armed groups and anarchy would spread from Jenin and Nablus to their city . They revealed that some activists from Jenin and Nablus moved to Jericho over the past year.Jericho : Once a "" sleepy town "" with stability despite violence in the West BankOnce described as a & ldquo;sleepy town , & rdquo ; the situation in Jericho has been generally stable over the past year , despite the significant upsurge of violence in the northern West Bank . The calm allowed many Arab investors from Israel and the West Bank to purchase relatively cheap land and build villas as vacation homes for themselves and to put on the booming short-term rental market.The calls by Hamas and other Palestinian groups for avenging the killing of the five Aqbat Jaber militants indicates that the security situation in the Jericho area could further deteriorate in the coming days and weeks.In a statement published shortly after the armed clash in the camp , Hamas praised the & ldquo;heroic resistance fighters&rdquo ; and said that the & ldquo;confrontation with the enemy confirms once again that our people are on the path of resistance and liberation and won&rsquo;t be intimidated by the crimes of the occupation . & rdquo;The Aqbat Baber Camp Battalion also pledged to retaliate for the killing of its men , although it remains unclear whether the group has more members operating in the camp and other areas of Jericho . What is certain , however , is that the Hamas members operated inside a camp located only a few hundred meters away from the main headquarters of the PA security forces in the city . It is also located not far from the notorious Jericho Prison , where the Palestinian security forces often hold Palestinians suspected of being affiliated with Hamas and PIJ.The PA leadership , which recently decided to halt security coordination with Israel in response to the killing of nine Palestinians , mostly gunmen , during a similar Israeli security operation in Jenin Refugee Camp , on Monday condemned the & ldquo;new crime&rdquo ; in Aqbat Jaber camp . In a statement issued by Abbas&rsquo;s office , the PA accused the Israeli government of continuing its & ldquo;crimes&rdquo ; against the Palestinians.Hours before the incident in Aqbat Jaber camp , Abbas chaired a meeting of the commanders of the Palestinian security forces and discussed with them the ongoing tensions and violence , especially in the West Bank.At the meeting , Abbas reportedly reaffirmed the Palestinian leadership&rsquo;s decision to end the security coordination with Israel . In the same breath , he also instructed the Palestinian security services & ldquo;to assume their role in preserving the rule of law , public security and civil peace . & rdquo;This was not the first time in recent months that Abbas has issued such instructions to his security forces.Yet , despite the instructions , the PA security forces have failed to take significant action against armed groups and gunmen in Jenin and Nablus , who continue to operate freely in areas under his control and carry out attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians . And there&rsquo;s no reason whatsoever to think that these security forces will now take meaningful measures to stop Jericho from joining Jenin and Nablus as terror hubs in the West Bank .","is jericho the next palestinian terror hub after jenin , nablus ?"

My only interest in its existence is if it operates within existing agreements&hellip ; and takes care of its citizens and thwarts and acts against terror and works in conjunction with the Israeli security forces , then the PA is an authority with which one can have a in-depth relationship , & rdquo ; Smotrich said.The withholding of tax fees was part of a series of sanctions Israel imposed on the PA to protest its successful initiative through the International Court of Justice , which will now issue an advisory opinion on the legality of Israel&rsquo;s & ldquo;occupation . & rdquo;Israel suspends Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki's travel passIsrael suspended on Sunday a pass easing Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki&rsquo;s travel in the West Bank as part of the sanctions it leveled against the PA late last week to protest its push for an International Court of Justice advisory opinion against the Jewish state . & ldquo;The foreign minister will continue his job and his diplomatic activities with or without the card , & rdquo ; Maliki&rsquo;s aid Ahmed Al-Deek told Reuters.Maliki&rsquo;s & ldquo;VIP&rdquo ; travel card was confiscated by border staff as he crossed from Jordan into the West Bank via the Allenby Crossing , his office said . The Defense Ministry confirmed the suspension of Maliki&rsquo;s VIP pass.Retaliatory measures taken by Israel against PalestiniansIn an interview with Voice of Palestine Radio , Maliki said his office had written to governments around the world asking that to condemn the Israeli sanctions.Israel confiscated Maliki&rsquo;s VIP card in 2021 after he returned from a meeting of the ICC . It was not immediately clear why the card had been confiscated and when it will be restored.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the sanctions at the start of his weekly government meeting , explaining that they were in response to & ldquo;a radical anti-Israel decision at the UN . & rdquo;He said that & ldquo;these steps include sanctions against senior Palestinian officials , the offsetting of terrorist funds and the freezing of Palestinian construction projects in Area C , which contravene the explicit commitments that the PA has taken upon itself . & ldquo;We have established a different government with a different policy , and everyone will see this , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said.On Sunday , Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich ordered Tax Authority Director Eran Ya&rsquo;akov to transfer NIS 138.8 million from tax fees it had collected on behalf of the PA to Israeli victims of Palestinian terror . & ldquo;Today we are correcting an injustice , & rdquo ; Smotrich said . & ldquo;This is an important day for morality , justice and the war on terror , & rdquo ; particularly given the PA&rsquo;s policy of paying monthly stipends to terrorists and their families , he said . & ldquo;There is no greater justice than offsetting the authority&rsquo;s funds that support terrorism and transferring them to the families of the victims of terrorism , & rdquo ; Smotrich said . & ldquo;There is no comfort here for the families of the murdered , but there is justice here . I am happy that I had the privilege of leading this amendment process as one of my first actions as Finance Minister , & rdquo ; he said.The parents of Lt . Shir Hajaj , 22 , one of four soldiers killed in a Jerusalem terror attack in 2017 , were present in the ministry when Smotrich signed the order and they thanked the government for its decision .

2024-05-04 09:32:24.147,jpost,"The IDF operated overnight and on Saturday morning to hunt down the killer of Elhanan Klein , which saw soldiers from the navy and the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Services ) confront a terror cell and kill five terrorists , the military reported.The cell , which had been under surveillance for half a year , was intercepted by Israeli forces just as they were allegedly planning another major terrorist act . The confrontation erupted late Thursday evening in a densely populated residential area where terrorists were using civilian cover to evade capture.The intense firefight , which lasted more than 12 hours , resulted in the critical injury of an elite IDF commando . Medical teams at Beilinson Hospital in Petah Tikva are currently battling to save his life . The operation was led by Menashe Brigade Commander Lt . - Col . Ayoub Kayouf , involving stealth tactics that aimed to surprise and quickly apprehend the terrorists with minimal civilian involvement and collateral damage.According to the report , the IDF raided the village of Deir al-Ghusun in the Tulkarm area , targeting the terrorists who carried out the attack last November near the town of Beit Lid on Highway 557 , where Klein , a father of three from Enav , was killed on his way back from reserve duty.The terrorists also carried out a terror attack on April 7 , 2024 , near the Nabi Elias junction in the West Bank , in which two Israelis were wounded , one of them a female soldier.The military said that the four terrorists who were killed were Adnan Taisir Kamal Samara , a Hamas member from Tulkarm who had previously been imprisoned for being involved with the terrorist group ; Alaa Adib Abed Aljaber Sharitakh , another Hamas member who had been imprisoned for 14 years due to his involvement in terrorist activity ; Tamer Abed Allatif Rajeh Rajeh , a Hamas member from the town of Shuweika ; and Asal Bashir Taufik Badran a Palestinian Islamic Jihad member from the town of Deir al-Ghusun who had also been imprisoned for being involved in terrorist activity.The military noted that in the past few months , additional collaborators had been arrested and had confessed to being involved in the attacks , funded by Hamas.Despite stall in Gaza , IDF continues West Bank operations&nbsp;The terrorists barricaded themselves inside a house and opened fire on the IDF soldiers , who responded by opening fire and using shoulder-fired missiles , as well as a remotely piloted aircraft , to attack the building.In addition to the five terrorists who were eliminated , five wanted individuals were arrested in the nearby village of Sebastia near Nablus.The IDF dismantled defenses and breached houses in Tulkarm , looking for a number of terrorists in the area.The standoff concluded when engineering units used heavy machinery to breach the building after prolonged exchanges of gunfire . Despite initial assessments that the building&rsquo;s destruction had neutralized the threat , two terrorists emerged from the debris , leading to further confrontations . One attacker attempted to continue the assault but was neutralized by an IDF bulldozer operated by the Engineering Corps.Avi Ashkenazi contributed to this report . & nbsp ;","idf kills terrorists responsible for murder of elhanan klein , one soldier critically wounded"
2024-06-23 23:31:40.580,jpost,"In his first interview in Hebrew media since the outbreak of war , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insinuated that threats by protesters against his government&rsquo;s judicial reforms to stop serving in the IDF reserves played a part in Hamas&rsquo;s decision to attack Israel on October 7 . & ldquo;The refusal [ to serve ] is a disaster & ndash ; and created illusions for our enemies , & rdquo ; the prime minister said during the interview on Channel 14.Netanyahu also criticized current protesters calling for an election . & ldquo;I say to the protesters & ndash ; get it together . This is the time for unity , this is the time for greatness . Their goal is to bring down the government , and every time their excuse is different . I do not think that it reflects a majority of the people . I turn to the majority of the people and say & ndash ; this is the time for unity , & rdquo ; the prime minister said.Addressing the four different warnings by the IDF during the period of the judicial reforms that the social upheaval they had created was a danger to national security , Netanyahu said he himself had made similar warnings in real time and did not need the IDF warnings to tell him that . The prime minister added that the IDF assessments prior to October 7 was that Hamas was & ldquo;deterred , and therefore he was unaware of the threat of the massacre.Netanyahu added that while he believed that every person who was in a position of authority on October 7 bared & ldquo;some responsibility , & rdquo ; now was not the time to form a national committee of investigation , since it would & ldquo;add to the [ heavy ] load&rdquo ; of running the war.Netanyahu criticizes Gantz and EisenkotThe prime minister also voiced harsh criticism of Benny Gantz and fellow National Unity MK Gadi Eisenkot for leaving the government on June 9 , after joining it days after the October 7 massacre . Gantz and Eisenkot said that they had decided to depart after the prime minister began taking into account personal political considerations while making decisions regarding the war . & ldquo;Gantz and Eisenkot did something that is not done & ndash ; leaving the government in war time , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said . Asked about their claims , the prime minister responded , & ldquo;And they do not have political considerations ? My consideration is to ensure the safety of Israel . & rdquo ; Netanyahu invited other parties currently in the opposition to join the government in Gantz and Eisenkot&rsquo;s place.In an odd moment in the interview , Netanyahu repeated a misleading claim that the bill to draft haredim into the IDF that is currently being processed in the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee ( FADC ) will bring & ldquo;many thousands&rdquo ; of haredi men into the IDF.The bill , as it currently stands , includes a gradual increase of haredi draftees per year , from the current 1,000 or so per year to approximately 35 % of each graduating class & ndash ; roughly 5,000 men & ndash ; per year in 2036 . The numbers would not rise significantly in the coming years , and the sanctions for haredi yeshivot that do not meet their quotas are directed against the yeshivot themselves but not at the individuals who avoid the draft . This is widely regarded as insufficient to lead to real change.Netanyahu said that he expected opposition leaders MK Yair Lapid and Gantz to support the bill , as it passed its first reading under their government in 2022 . However , a significant portion of Knesset members from Netanyahu&rsquo;s own Likud party , the entire opposition , and the Defense Ministry have all said that the law was no longer relevant to the IDF&rsquo;s needs post October 7.Netanyahu&rsquo;s remarks on the haredi bill were surprising , as many members of the Likud , including those who have not expressed opposition to the bill as it currently stands , have said that it was only a preliminary version . This led to widespread belief that Netanyahu himself was open to a more sweeping version of the bill , closer to what many see as the bare minimum to meet the IDF&rsquo;s needs & ndash ; to reach a 50 % draft rate of haredi men within five years.The haredi parties are unlikely to accept such a version of the bill , and may opt to attempt to topple the government rather than pass it . The issue of the haredi draft is thus viewed as a litmus test for the prime minister & ndash ; whether he acts in the national interest or gives preference to the survival of his coalition . & nbsp ;","judicial reform protesters partly to blame for hamas massacre , netanyahu hints"

Game 2 is slated for Friday at Lev HaMoshava in Ness Ziona while Game 3 will be back at Yad Eliyahu on Sunday.Brown scored 18 points , DiBartolomeo added 15 points and Jake Cohen chipped in with 14 points in the win . Isaiah Whitehead scored 15 points and Rawle Alkins dropped 13 points for Ness Ziona in the loss . & ldquo;I think overall I&rsquo;m satisfied with the result and the way that we played , & rdquo ; Katash said after the game . & ldquo;In the first quarter we were focused . It&rsquo;s the start of the playoffs and every game is important . I think the game reached a margin that could cause us to relax and be complacent . We need to stay focused . I think Ness Ziona is a better team than the result indicates . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We came into our first playoff game and Maccabi came as they know how to for the first game , & rdquo ; Meir Tapiro said of his Ness Ziona squad . & ldquo;They did good work , us less so . We&rsquo;ll look forward to the next game . & rdquo;Nebo reflected on the game . & ldquo;We understand that it&rsquo;s a series and not a one off whether we win by 20 points or two points , it&rsquo;s only one game . & rdquo;In the capital city , Hapoel Jerusalem got by Hapoel Holon 93-86 in overtime to take a 1-0 quarterfinal series lead.Levi Randolph kept the Reds in front for the majority of the game but a furious comeback led by Justin Smith and Shachar Amir drew the Purples even at 80-80 at the end of the regulation , sending the contest into an extra session.From there Yovel Zoosman scored a pair of crucial buckets while Randolph did the same to give Yonatan Alon&rsquo;s squad the hard-earned win.Randolph scored 30 points , Speedy Smith added 17 points while JaCorey Williams and Noam Dovrat each scored 10 points a piece in the win . Justin Smith led Holon with 18 points as Tahjere McCall and Shachar Amir each scored 14 points in the loss . & ldquo;We played well but we made our lives difficult in the fourth quarter , & rdquo ; Jerusalem&rsquo;s Alon said . & ldquo;I have to give credit to Holon for how they came and played that quarter and they were able to play physically . They came out much more aggressive at the start of the game and I told the guys that we had to react . I really believe in the guys and they are winners who know how to win games . That&rsquo;s how we won the game because they are winners and that&rsquo;s what worked . & rdquo ; & ldquo;It was great to be in the game at the end and the matchup really began in the first few minutes when we were up by double digits , & rdquo ; Holon coach Amit Sherf said . & ldquo;Jerusalem has a lot of tools but Justin Smith was key for us as we battled the entire game through . This is a series and I have to see what we can do better in the next game . & rdquo;Randolph also spoke about the overtime victory&ldquo;We turned up the defense in overtime and we were able to get some stops , get to the free-throw line which was key down the stretch . & rdquo;At the Drive-In Arena , Hapoel Tel Aviv eased past Hapoel Haifa 97-66 to snatch a 1-0 lead in their quarterfinal series.The hosts came out strong as John Holland scored at will to help the Reds to a 48-30 lead and never looked back to chalk up the win . Holland led the way for Tel Aviv with 27 points , Jaylen Hoard added 19 points and Isaiah Miles scored 13 points in the victory while Alex Hamilton and Marcus Bingham each scored 15 points for Haifa in the loss . & ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t start well but John Holland came in time to help us improve offensively , & rdquo ; Hapoel Tel Aviv coach Stefanos Dedas said . & ldquo;There is no real importance by the wide margin because every playoff game is a new contest and they each begin 0-0 . & rdquo ; & ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to do now , we just have to know how to put this game behind us and look ahead to the next , & rdquo ; Haifa coach Guy Goodes said . & ldquo;We needed more focus , more aggressiveness , those are the basics . We turned over the ball 19 times and we have to react quickly . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Everything begins with defense and it was important for us to begin the series here with a totally different playoff atmosphere , & rdquo ; said the game&rsquo;s MVP , Holland . & ldquo;It feels like it&rsquo;s been a year since we played at the Drive-In . The fans pushing us was incredible and it&rsquo;s great to play here . & rdquo;Also , Ironi Kiryat Ata swiped home-court advantage away from Maccabi Ramat Gan with a thrilling 95-94 win.Amin Stevens and James Batemon played superbly throughout the 40 minutes and they were able to quell Nuni Omot and JP Tokoto , but it was Akia Pruitt&rsquo;s late 3-point play that created a big enough gap late in the game to hand the visitors the surprise victory.Stevens scored 26 points , Batemon added 22 points while Ben Saraf scored 14 points in the win for Kiryat Ata . Ramat Gan&rsquo;s Omot and Tokoto scored 17 points apiece in defeat . & ldquo;It was a game like a playoff is meant to be , against a great and deep team , & rdquo ; Kiryat Ata coach Sharon Avrahami said . & ldquo;We came back from a double-digit deficit , which was our first mental test . We then controlled the game , but let them get back into it . We showed a lot of character , but we know it&rsquo;s just the beginning of the series . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We knew it would be a difficult game and their two central players caused damage and we will need to make a number of adjustments on Thursday , & rdquo ; said Ramat Gan bench boss Shmulik Brenner .",playoffs tip off with four last-eight series
2024-03-05 14:20:20.043,jpost,"Emeric Pressburger , the Hungarian-Jewish director and screenwriter who built a career in Berlin , fled the Nazi regime in the 1930s , but unlike many of his European Jewish contemporaries who went to Hollywood , Pressburger immigrated to Britain.There , he teamed up with another up-and-coming filmmaker , Michael Powell , and the two collaborated on a series of wildly popular films that became classics and influenced a generation of young American directors , among them Martin Scorsese , who produced and narrated a new documentary about their work , Made in England : The Films of Powell and Pressburger , which premiered at the Berlinale , the Berlin International Film Festival.In this documentary , Scorsese , who will receive an Honorary Golden Bear Award for his career this year , and who is famous for talking fast , can&rsquo;t say enough about how these films , which he first saw on television as a sickly child in New York , blew his mind and shaped his sensibility as a filmmaker.Their movies , as this documentary shows in beautiful detail , were visually imaginative and exciting in a way that could appeal to a young boy , but also featured deeply romantic and philosophical themes about choosing a spiritually rewarding life over materialism . They sometimes showcased music and dance , using visual richness to highlight the music , and often their films were very funny in a quintessentially British way.The movies they made together include The Red Shoes , the fantastic and larger-than-life story of a ballerina ( played by real-life ballet dancer Moira Shearer ) who must choose between love and dancing , which became the favorite film of a generation of dance-loving little girls.Their opera adaptation , Tales of Hoffmann , features evocative cinematography that makes the drama of the opera music come to life in a way that influenced Scorsese to become a director , as he explains in the film.They had a few years making British propaganda films to help morale during World War II , including The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp , a gentle comedy-romance that celebrated British sweetness and eccentricity . In addition , they made the quirky romance I Know Where I&rsquo;m Going ! set on an island off the Scottish coast , and many other movies of British life that were unlike anything made by any other filmmakers.Focus of David Hinton's documentaryThe documentary , directed by David Hinton , deals with their working relationship , in which Pressburger , who didn&rsquo;t speak English till he was in his 30s , outlined the intricate screenplays and created the characters , while Powell wrote the dialogue and handled most on-the-set directing chores.Scorsese seems more interested in Powell and his revolutionary visual flourishes and paints Pressburger as the more & ldquo;practical&rdquo ; of the partners , who saw the value in compromising with studios who tried to rein in their vision.The movie doesn&rsquo;t examine Pressburger&rsquo;s life as a Jewish refugee and his loss of family members , nor does it consider how these experiences might have led him to a more practical approach to his filmmaking career . But it does detail how their partnership was as deep and emotionally charged as any marriage.The movie portrays their breakup as sad , but their love and respect for each other stayed strong , and , after a period when they were virtually forgotten , they later enjoyed recognition for their achievements , spearheaded by a younger generation of filmmakers such as Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola.Those who are interested in a more detailed look at Pressburger&rsquo;s life would be advised to track down the 1995 documentary The Making of an Englishman , which was directed by his grandson Kevin Macdonald ( The Last King of Scotland ) and produced by another grandson , Andrew Macdonald ( the producer of Trainspotting ) . While they knew their grandfather , he was a distant if admired figure in their lives , but his love of and filmmaking talent were passed down.The Making of an Englishman spends quite a bit of time on his early life , showing how , after leaving Hungary for Germany , he had to sleep in the park while trying to break into the German film industry , one of the most developed in the world at the time . It also shows the difficult moment when he realized he had to flee the Nazi regime and his decision to , as the title suggests , make himself into an English director who had a sensibility as British as any native-born Englishman . His grandsons present him as an enigmatic but fascinating figure .",martin scorsese’s new documentary about the films of powell and pressburger premieres in berlin

The extension comes following the recommendations of Defense Minister Benny Gantz , Israel Police and the Interior Ministry - making it possible to allocate rescue forces under police command , allot further access to required equipment and continue the restriction of movement on residents of the city . Further state of emergency extensions beyond three applications will require full government approval . Under the current curfew , residents of the city are prohibited from leaving their homes , except for going to protected areas amid rocket fire or to receive emergency medical treatment . Police warned that violations of these prohibitions are punishable by up to three years in prison . The extended order comes as Lod , Ramla and other cities with mixed populations of Israeli Jews and Arabs&nbsp;experience violent rioting and infighting on an almost nightly basis . The unrest has left one dead , scores injured , and homes , vehicles and businesses torched . The violence continued across Israel on Monday as the Police and Fire and Rescue Services struggled to respond to the volume of incidents . Some 71 people were arrested for disrupting public order on Monday night alone . Lod has become a main point of contention for police and rioters , having become a focal point for the civil unrest plaguing the country this past week . Amid the violence , a synagogue , homes , vehicles , garbage dumps and open areas have been torched in the southern Israeli city . Scores have been left injured from burns , stone-throwing incidents or targeted assaults . One person has died . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said while visited Lod on Thursday&nbsp;that there is no greater threat than the internal disturbances brewing throughout the country .

The strike is also calling for a show of solidarity with those detained during the countrywide rioting . The strike itself will encompass the entire Arab work sector , with the exception of the private education system and the Arab health sector . The committee addressed a number of UN bodies and other foreign missions in Israel , requesting the protection of Arab-Israeli citizens , calling for them to & quot;force Israel into taking immediate steps&quot ; to protect Palestinian citizens and bring an end to the violence against them .

He added that Druze - who stand as a bridge of peace between communities and religions in Israel - have a & quot;moral obligation&quot ; to calm the tides between Jewish Israelis and their Arab neighbors .

Every player who puts on a Maccabi Haifa must give 200 % effort and we have two more important games & ndash ; at Beersheba and a Haifa derby . & rdquo;Meanwhile , Hapoel Tel Aviv slipped by Hapoel Hadera 1-0 on a 35th-minute goal by Sagi Genis as the Reds ended their season on a high note before heading down to compete in the Leumit League after having been relegated following last week&rsquo;s loss . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough feeling to stand here in front of our fans due to the situation of being relegated , & rdquo ; interim head coach Saleem Tuama said . & ldquo;The fans cheered us on all season long and even now knowing we went down a league . But that&rsquo;s Hapoel Tel Aviv , where the supporters are always with us . Now we have to look ahead and continue on . & rdquo;Also , Ashdod SC sunk Hapoel Jerusalem 3-1 to take the win and the points as the port city side heads into the offseason.After a goalless first half , Amit Glazer was issued a red card in the 48th minute , which gave the hosts a man up for almost the entire second half as Stav Nachmani immediately took advantage of the situation to give Ashdod a 1&ndash;0 lead.Matan Hozez found the equalizer for Jerusalem in the 75th minute , but three minutes later Elad Shahaf gave Eli Levy&rsquo;s team the lead for good while Ilay Tamam added the insurance marker soon thereafter to take the victory . & ldquo;This sums up an excellent relegation playoff for us , & rdquo ; Levy began . & ldquo;We took it game by game and after each one we came closer and closer as a team . As a country we have had a tough time and for us in a city that was hit hard since October 7 we have not had the ideal preparations and things have not been the same . But I have to give credit to everyone here for making sure that this team would not go down a league . & rdquo;Elsewhere , Hapoel Haifa defeated Bnei Reineh 1-0 as Guy Melamed&rsquo;s first-half goal stood up for the Carmel Reds to take the win and the points .",maccabi tel aviv clinches championship at israel premier league

He explained that he intended to visit all of Israel , but when asked about the settlements , he confirmed that he had no plans to visit them . & ldquo;I am trying not to do things that aggravate people . I will meet with anyone who wants to meet with me .

I will meet with anyone who is Right , Left . . . I don&rsquo;t care , & rdquo ; Nides said . But when it comes to the settlements , he said , & ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying not to do symbolic things that just makes it worse . & rdquo;Historically , US ambassadors to Israel have not crossed the pre-1967 lines as part of their formal duties and did not visit the settlements . Former President Donald Trump changed that policy . Ambassador David Friedman , Trump&rsquo;s appointee , was the first official in his post to formally visit Jerusalem&rsquo;s Western Wall , which along with the Temple Mount , is Judaism&rsquo;s holiest site . Nides has reverted back to the prior policy , with one exception . Like Friedman , he too has visited the Western Wall . Nides noted that he has gone to the Western Wall scores of times since arriving in Israel last year and has visited with Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz who heads the Western Wall Heritage Foundation . & ldquo;I have gone to the Wall , the Kotel , four dozen times . I have a friend who is very sick with cancer . I go every day . I pray at the Wall . I don&rsquo;t make a big fuss of it . I put a note in and I leave , & rdquo ; he said . Rabinowitz has hosted him and they have appeared together in a few videos , Nides recalled . But Nides said that for political reasons he rejected an invitation to visit the excavation tunnels below . The rabbi noted that Friedman had visited the tunnels , Nides recalled . He told him , & ldquo;I know , that is great . But why do I need to do that ? I love this place , but why do I need to go do something that will aggravate a bunch of people ? & rdquo;In speaking of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , Nides said that the Biden administration is focused on a & ldquo;vision of peace&rdquo ; but can not desire it more than the Israelis and Palestinians .

"" We are still waiting for salvation , but nothing has changed , & rdquo ; Yehezkeli said . & ldquo;Hamas is still operating while we face humiliation from the international community .

The Palestinian existence has been shaken . After 75 years of their Nakba , they have realized that the tables can be turned . "" According to Yehezkeli , the most pressing question is what Israel should do now .

2024-03-12 21:28:19.503,jpost,"Israel&rsquo;s Knesset on Tuesday began a marathon debate to approve a controversial updated version of the 2024 national budget.The national budget in effect is a package of bills that are passed together . The first is the actual budget of each government ministry for the year 2024 ; the second sets the government&rsquo;s spending ceiling and budget deficit ; and the rest are several amendments to existing bills to adapt them to the new budget , such as a bill to apply a special tax on Israel&rsquo;s large banks during 2024.Knesset Finance Committee chairman MK Moshe Gafni ( United Torah Judaism ) blocked voting on several tax provisions aimed at increasing the 2024 national income , such as a new tax on Israel&rsquo;s central banks , and these have yet to arrive on the Knesset floor.Funding for haredi schoolsGafni did this to protest what he argued was insufficient funding for the haredi school systems . The national budget is likely to pass regardless , with the remaining provisions expected to pass later on in an additional bill when the dispute is resolved . The provisions are expected to add up to approximately NIS six billion in national income between the years 2024-2027.The dispute centers around Gafni&rsquo;s demand to include the haredi semi-private and private school systems in a reform that passed in 2008 called & ldquo;Ofek Hadash&rdquo ; ( Hebrew for & ldquo;New Horizon&rdquo ; ) , which offers an increase in teacher&rsquo;s salaries and additional benefits that depend on extracurricular work hours and other parameters . Gafni insists that the haredi teachers deserve to be paid the same as non-haredi teachers , but the reform also requires Education Ministry oversight and other components that he is unwilling to accept.Gafni alluded to this when presenting the budget . & ldquo;Everyone should know that an injustice is being committed here , and I will continue to fight so that they [ haredi teachers ] receive equal pay for equal work , & rdquo ; Gafni said.Fellow UTJ MK Yisrael Eichler , chairman of the Knesset Labor and Welfare Committee , who spoke after Gafni , blamed an & ldquo;aggressive media campaign&rdquo ; to bar haredi teachers from receiving equal pay , which Eichler said was & ldquo;theft , exploitation , and injustice . & rdquo;The debate began at 11:00 a.m . and is scheduled to run for 25 hours straight , until Wednesday at noon , after which voting will commence .

Palestinian officials and relatives said the body of Omar Abdalmajeed As&rsquo;ad was found in the Palestinian town of Jiljilya , near Ramallah , in the early hours of January 12 with a plastic zip tie around one wrist . The Biden administration has sought & ldquo;clarification&rdquo ; from Israel about As&rsquo;ad&rsquo;s death , US State Department spokesman Ned Price said last week . & ldquo;We are still waiting for the autopsy report , & rdquo ; Qattum said . & ldquo;Today I talked to the prosecutor , and he told me that it takes time to prepare such reports .

The soldiers said they had detained As&rsquo;ad since he was driving in a car that appeared suspicious , and they wanted to rule out that he was carrying arms . They detained As&rsquo;ad and moved him to a nearby abandoned home to be questioned . As&rsquo;ad resisted and claimed he was not a terrorist , Ynet reported . The soldiers allegedly then forcefully moved him into the abandoned home , tied his hands and covered his mouth . He then appeared & ldquo;woozy , & rdquo ; according to the soldiers , and they believed he had fallen asleep .

2024-04-19 17:00:25.063,jpost,"There was something about the story of the murder of a mother and two daughters during the Passover holiday last year that imprinted itself on the consciousness of the nation and catapulted Rabbi Leo Dee , the grieving husband and father , to international prominence.On April 7 , 2023 , Lucy Dee and her daughters Maia , 20 , and Rina , 15 , were driving to Tiberias over Hol Hamoed , the intermediate days of the week-long festival . Their vehicle was rammed off the road by terrorist gunmen , who shot all three women . Maia and Rina were killed on the scene , and Lucy passed away from her wounds two days later.In a private ceremony exactly one year later , Rabbi Leo Dee and his daughters Keren and Tali and son Yehuda ( now 19 , 18 and 15 years old ) dedicated a new social hall in their community of Efrat in Lucy’s memory.Later that evening , a standing-room-only crowd of 700 , plus 2,400 who watched the ceremony online , gathered in the newly dedicated Shirat Lucy ( Lucy’s Song ) Hall above the Mishkan Tziporah synagogue in Efrat to remember the three women and to draw inspiration from their lives.Rabbi Leo Dee speaksAfter thanking the attendees for “ the abundance of love , help , positive wishes , and kindness from everyone this year , ” Rabbi Dee called these collective acts of kindness “ our greatest nechama [ comfort ] . ” In his talk , Rabbi Dee highlighted what he identified as “ some of the thousands of projects that have been set off during this year in their memory by friends , family , and people we have never met before ! ” He spoke about the Torah scroll written in Lucy’s memory , “ with every one of the 300,000 letters written by different schoolchildren , soldiers , and others from around the world … . This sefer Torah is the essence of Lucy’s quest to get every Jew to feel part of our greater story and to shine their light in the world . ” In a widely publicized follow-up story to the murders , seven people received one of Lucy’s organs . In the audience that night was Rina Lital , the recipient of Lucy Dee’s heart . While relating all the ways that Rina’s life has begun to mirror Lucy’s since the transplant , Rabbi Dee said , “ The head of organ donations at Beilinson [ Hospital , Rabin Medical Center , Petah Tikvah ] recently announced on national radio that the 30 % increase in organ donors in Israel is directly connected to Lucy’s story . ” Continuing the theme of saving lives , Rabbi Dee said that “ groups of extremely generous Swiss and American donors , who had never met any of us , dedicated a number of ambulances in [ Lucy’s ] memory and in the memory of Rina and Maia . They have saved numerous lives since then . ” Dressed in matching white T-shirts , the students and faculty of Efrat’s Orot Yehuda , where Lucy was a much-loved English teacher , recorded a haunting video of songs of encouragement and faith dedicated to Lucy’s memory . The five-minute video garnered more than 43,000 views in its first four days.In Maia’s memory , tens of thousands of Jews around the world are learning and discussing a teaching from Pirkei Avot ( Ethics of the Fathers ) at their Shabbat table each week . The project started 18 months ago , when the Dees hosted two of Maia’s friends from London . On that Shabbat , they learned one mishna from Pirkei Avot at each meal . In Maia’s memory , those friends expanded the project to the extent that Rabbi Dee commented , “ I cannot travel anywhere today without people coming up to me and saying , ‘ I am learning your Pirkei Avot . ’ ” He also talked about a project that Maia initiated during her National Service in a high school in Yeroham . She provided snacks to encourage girls to study the weekly Torah portion during their morning break . Maia named the project “ Nish Nosh Parsh ” and , according to Rabbi Dee , the project “ has now been rolled out to hundreds of ulpanot across Israel in her memory . ” Rabbi Dee shared that Rina’s friendly and adventurous nature has been memorialized in “ a trip to Masada for hundreds of teens from around the country before Pesach . They are planning to build a spring for [ Rina ] in Hamra over the summer . “ Rina , if there was a girl in your year feeling lonely , you were the one with your arm around her , and you were the one who would start a new ball game to include her , ” her father said . “ To remember your kindness , your friends have built a special space in the school at Kiryat Arba to bring everyone together during break times and for Mincha [ afternoon prayers ] ( which you inspired everyone to daven ) , and they have dedicated a new chug of basketball , to which everyone is invited and will keep everyone fit . ” Future plans include a new youth house for Ezra in the Tamar neighborhood of Efrat in memory of Rina , who was instrumental in helping to establish the Tamar branch.Speaking directly to his wife and daughters , Dee concluded his summary of memorial projects with the words , “ Lucy , Maia , and Rina – you will never be forgotten . Everything I am doing is dedicated to one of you , and so many projects continue in your merit . ” The rabbi peppered his evening’s talk with the question , “ Mi kamocha , Yisrael ? ” ( Who is like you , Israel ? ) , highlighting the many ways that he has been inspired by the Jewish people’s response to his family’s tragedy . He concluded with seven lessons he has drawn from the past year.These were his exact words:There’s no benefit to being sad . I believe that the purpose of mourning is to get to a point where you can remember your loved ones with a smile ; otherwise , we’ll never want to think about them at all . The challenge is figuring out how to do it . With the help of all these projects and more , Am Yisrael [ the Nation of Israel ] has been the greatest help.There’s nothing like the Jewish people . From the shiva [ week-long mourning period ] onwards , we have felt that we did not lose three members of our family of seven , but three from our family of 14 million.Tzaddikim [ righteous people ] live forever : They never die . Rashaim [ evil people ] never live , even when they are alive . This also applies to nations . The Jewish people from all past generations are still living through their contributions to our lives today . Our enemies have contributed nothing but destruction and are forgettable even while they live.I’m grateful for the 30 years I knew Lucy , the 20 years I knew Maia , and the 15 years I knew Rina . Your impact on this world is immeasurable . What you have achieved in half a lifetime , or quarter of a lifetime , is more than most of us could achieve in 10 lifetimes . It’s a challenge to always think of the good times , but that’s what’s needed.The best treatment for destruction is to build . The first mitzvah of the Shulchan Aruch [ Code of Jewish Law ] is to jump out of bed in the morning like a lion . This means : You must have something to jump out of bed for . Every Jew must have at least one passion he or she is working on at any time , and that’s what gets you up in the morning . If you are struggling to get out of bed , find your passion . Friday morning , planting fruit trees in Efrat was fulfilling the biblical mitzvah of Yishuv Ha’Aretz , settling the land . We will continue to build , we will continue to plant.There’s no youth like our Jewish youth . They have get up and go , they build , they invent , and they are the bravest generation in our history . I am proud of every one of them . They are the or le’goyim [ light unto the nations ] . At the shiva , some 17-year-old boys from the community asked if they could build a viewpoint [ lookout ] in Efrat in memory of the girls , and I apparently agreed . Nine months later , they showed me what they had achieved – and the Mitzpeh HaDegel [ Flag Outlook ] would be a victory for a professional landscape company , let alone a group of 17-year-old boys who raised the funds themselves and taught themselves how to build pergolas and plant trees from YouTube videos.Finally , I learned that what matters is not my emunah in Hashem , my faith in God , but rather Hashem’s faith in me . Every morning I say “ Modeh Ani … Rabah Emunatecha ” Thank you , Hashem , for Your faith in me . We can appreciate the infinite miracles in our lives – the friends , the family , Am Yisrael , Eretz Yisrael [ the Land of Israel ] – but if Hashem agreed for us to wake up this morning , He has a purpose for us . Our job is not to question Him but to find that purpose . Today there are hundreds of thousands of Jews in Israel fighting for our people and for freedom in the world – fulfilling their purpose , and millions of others are supporting them.The daughters speakGathered together for strength and support , the three remaining Dee children ascended the platform , where both daughters spoke about their mother and sisters . At the evening event , Keren and Tali , who are fully bilingual , spoke in Hebrew ; at the memorial ceremony at the cemetery in Kfar Etzion the next morning , they delivered their comments in English.Keren revealed the truth about living post-trauma by contrasting her daily reality with what she described as “ the beautiful image I built for myself from the outside . ” “ At night , every thought and feeling that comes to mind keeps switching to difficult things . I am flooded with memories ; tossing and turning over and over and unable to sleep . At about five , I get out of bed in despair and decide to spend the remaining time ‘ til morning on my phone . ” She then recounted what her day would be like if her mother and sisters were still alive , including a poignant image of finding her mother in the kitchen baking “ some indulgent chocolate banana muffins that we could take with us ; and reminding us , of course , that it’s important to put on sunscreen so we don’t have wrinkles and to drink a lot because it’s hot today . ” Keren mused about the “ Orphan’s Kaddish ” she finds in her prayerbook and how she realized , with a start , that this memorial prayer now refers to her . She concluded with a thought she learned from her father that she said “ helps me continue . ” “ What if our life was supposed to look like this ? What if God predestined an allotted time for them to be with us ? For 18 years ? And then we were meant to go on alone ? ” she asked . “ And then I ask myself , if I had the option and I knew that my life would look like this from the beginning , would I take it or give it up ? “ Everything in life that made me who I am today , I learned from them , ” Keren said . “ Mummy : If it’s doing hessed [ acts of kindness ] , giving , caring , cooking like crazy , forgiving , being a listening ear but always remembering that there is something more to aspire to and to move forward , then that’s what she’ll do . “ Maia : Demanding what you deserved , dressing in style , giving good advice , putting effort into what is important to you , loving the Torah , and always listening to others . “ Rina : Loving this country , being righteous with complete faith that this is the way , being humble , loving and believing that everyone has something special of their own . “ In short , of course I would choose life ! “ Mummy , Maia , and Rina , I believe that you are still by my side in every dilemma I have , every new beginning , in every frustration and in every achievement . Thank you for being with me during the most beautiful 18 years of my life , and now I must move on : not by replacing you , or forgetting you , but with you by my side and above . ” TALI , the younger Dee sister , spoke about all the times , places , and circumstances when she misses her mother and sisters.In a heartrending admission , Tali shared that “ I don’t have a mother’s voice in my life . There is no one to wake me up in the morning and push me out of bed . Everyone wants to make it easy for me , they tell me to [ have ] compassion on myself – but I often just need your demanding voice . I miss your hug . There is nothing in the world that can replace it . And no human being can fill that place . Someone who will take me with my temper , to whom I can show all my hard sides – and no matter what , you will always love me . ” Moving from the personal to the national , she said , “ And during this year , our nation has also turned upside down . After the attack [ on October 7 ] , I thought a lot about the difference between soldiers who knowingly put themselves at risk , and my family , who just wanted to go on holiday . “ But I understood that we chose to live here in this country . And we were always aware of the dangers present in this choice . The home front and the battle front are close to each other in our country , ” Tali said . “ Many people are now experiencing what I experienced and I want to tell them it gets easier , but I’m not sure I can say that . There are days when I really manage to be happy . But there is no pill that can cure the pain ; there is no pill that fixes everything . “ … I’m not the same person after everything that happened to me . This story is such a central part of my identity that you can’t really know me without it . I’ve grown up . I have a broader perspective . Things I cried about a year ago are not the things I cry about now , ” she said . “ In many ways , this is what is happening to our nation . We went through something huge : terrible . And we can’t go back to being what we were before . We sacrificed too much for this . We need to grow up . Our prayers should increase . ” Tali concluded her remarks by speaking of how her mother and sisters still influence her . “ Thanks to Rina , I now pay much more attention to the people around me : say hello to everyone , even the girls I’m less friendly with . To be a better friend , to reduce my ego ; to have a simple joy . “ Thanks to Maia , when I’m in midrasha I try harder and invest more , and I’m not ashamed to ask questions . “ Thanks to Mummy , I try to be more flexible . “ Some days it’s harder to feel it , but sometimes I feel like I have three angels of my own , ” she revealed . “ I feel protected . ” A close friend speaksIn a raw and deeply personal speech delivered at the cemetery , Lucy’s close friend Danja Keesing related an amusing story about how her friend convinced her to wake up in time to take an exercise class together early Sunday mornings . “ Sunday mornings , I liked you least of all , I have to admit . Actually , I didn’t like you at all . No one is perky on Sunday morning after Shabbos … besides Lucy . ” Lucy’s enthusiasm eventually won Keesing over . “ That is your essence , Lucy : believing in others – maybe even many times more than you ever believed in yourself . ” Later she declared , “ You loved so , so hard ; tried so , so hard . Had so many love and care goals as a wife and a mother that sometimes I thought to myself , ‘ What is the intensity ? What is the rush ? Breathe . Take less to heart . Don’t work so hard . Don’t try so hard . ’ “ Now I know that your soul knew that what others do in 70 , 80 , or 90 years , you had to do in less than 50 . ” The evening memorial program also featured a siyum ( conclusion celebration ) on Mishna made by Maia’s friends , and words of Torah in Hebrew from Rabbanit Yemima Mizrachi . The evening ended with a group sing-along , filled with songs about Moshiach ( Messiah ) and redemption led by Shlomo Katz , who is a musician and rabbi of Shirat David in Efrat .  The writer is a freelance journalist and expert on the non-Jewish awakening to Torah happening in our day .

Who issued the order to the [ Israel ] police to stand with the settlers in killing the people of Jerusalem ? Where did these decisions came from ? Africa ? We won&rsquo;t allow anyone to fool us . This is nonsense . Where is [ Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu ? Netanyahu , may God prolong his life , is still the prime minister . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Abbas said that the Palestinians are ready to hold the elections once Israel agrees to allow the vote to take place in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We want the elections to take place in Jerusalem , and not in Abu Dis , & rdquo ; he said , referring to a West Bank village south of Jerusalem . & ldquo;For us , the elections are not a tactic or a game . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Abbas said that the EU made a big effort to exert pressure on Israel to allow the elections to take place in Jerusalem , but to no avail . & nbsp ; & ldquo;When we announced the elections , the Europeans told us that they support us and are ready to help us achieve our goal , & rdquo ; he noted . & ldquo;I told the Europeans that that Israel will not agree to hold the elections in Jerusalem . They told me that they will talk to the Israelis about this . We also asked the Americans where are they , but we didn&rsquo;t hear from them . We waited and didn&rsquo;t receive a response . We also sent our foreign minister to Europe to tell them we are running out of time . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; According to Abbas , the heads of the EU told him that they were & ldquo;frustrated&rdquo ; by Israel&rsquo;s refusal to respond to the request to hold the elections in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Abbas accused Israel of & ldquo;beating&rdquo ; Palestinian candidates in Jerusalem and preventing election gatherings . & nbsp ; He went on to praise the residents of east Jerusalem for protesting Israeli security restrictions in the city in the past three weeks . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I want to praise the great stance of our people in Jerusalem and the Arab people who stood with us regarding the events in Jerusalem in the past few weeks , & rdquo ; Abbas said . & ldquo;There is a great people in Jerusalem capable of saying no to the occupation . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; He accused the Israeli government of supporting Jewish extremists who chanted & quot;Death to the Arabs&quot ; during a recent demonstration near the Old City of Jerusalem . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Referring to the removal of the police barricades from Damascus Gate & ndash ; which reportedly triggered the clashes in the city & ndash ; Abbas said : & ldquo;Jerusalem belongs to us ; our brothers managed to remove the barricades that prevented them from moving and working in the city . They launched a peaceful , popular resistance . This is the only way to confront this aggression on our people . Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Palestine . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Earlier this week , Foreign Ministry political adviser Alon Bar told European ambassadors that Israel was not interfering with the scheduled Palestinian elections . & ldquo;Israel will not prevent the elections in the Palestinian Authority from happening , & rdquo ; Bar said . The Palestinian elections are an internal Palestinian matter , and Israel will not intervene , he added . & nbsp ; Hamas officials said they did not participate in the meeting of the faction leaders because they received an invitation only at the last minute . & ldquo;Hamas&rsquo;s position is clear : we reject the postponement of the elections and we will not provide a cover for such a decision , & rdquo ; said Mohammed Subha , a spokesperson for the Hamas electoral list & ldquo;Jerusalem is Our Destiny . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Subha warned that postponement of the elections would have a negative impact on efforts to end the rivalry between Hamas and Fatah . He also hinted that the move could trigger widespread protests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . & nbsp ; Hours before the meeting , thousands of Palestinians demonstrated in the Gaza Strip to voice opposition to the cancellation of the elections . & nbsp ; Some of the protests were organized by supporters of exiled Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan , an archrival of Abbas . Dahlan loyalists have formed an electoral list called Al-Mustaqbal ( Future ) to contest the parliamentary elections . & nbsp ; Nayrouz Qarmout , a spokeswoman for Al-Mustaqbal , pointed out that 25 electoral lists running in the parliamentary elections were opposed to the cancellation of the vote . & ldquo;No one has the right to postpone the elections , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;Only those who are afraid of the results don&rsquo;t want elections . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Qarmout and other Palestinians predicted that the cancellation of the elections would intensify the dispute between Fatah and Hamas . & nbsp ; In a joint statement , the electoral lists warned that the cancellation of the elections would be a & ldquo;constitutional crime . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;The cancellation of the elections is a new and big catastrophe for the Palestinians , & rdquo ; said Abdel Hakim Awad , a senior official with Dahlan&rsquo;s Democratic Reform Current movement . & ldquo;It will have dire effects and serious consequences on the Palestinian people . The elections are a light at the end of the tunnel in order to unify the Palestinian people and end the division [ between the West Bank and Gaza Strip ] . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The decision to hold the elections was part of an agreement reached between Fatah , Hamas and 12 other Palestinian factions . & nbsp ; The agreement , reached under the auspices of Egypt , called for boosting public freedoms in the West Bank and Gaza Strip , including the immediate release of detainees held by the PA and Hamas and non-interference by the Palestinian security forces in the electoral process . & nbsp ; The agreement was reached after months of negotiations , which began in July 2020 between Fatah and Hamas leaders in Turkey , Qatar and Egypt . & nbsp ; In accordance with the agreement , Abbas issued a decree on January 15 for holding the first general elections since 2006 , when Hamas won the parliamentary vote . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The Palestinian people in Jerusalem and all constituencies of the nation are invited to general , free and direct elections to elect members of the Palestinian Legislative Council ( PLC ) on May 22 , 2021 and President of the State of Palestine on July 31 , 2021 , & rdquo ; Abbas said in the decree . & nbsp ; According to the decree , the PLC elections shall be considered the first stage for the election of the Palestinian National Council ( PNC ) , the PLO&rsquo;s legislative body . The formation of the PNC shall be completed on August 31 , 2021 . & nbsp ; The Palestinian Central Elections Commission said that 36 electoral lists submitted their nomination applications for the PLC elections , including 29 independent lists and seven from political parties . The number of candidates nominated for the 132-member PLC reached 1,391 , including 405 women .",abbas : palestinian elections postponed after israel blocks jerusalem vote
2021-04-08 17:00:50.617,jpost,"& nbsp;On April 7 , 2011 , a new era began for Israel&rsquo;s air and missile defense forces & ndash ; when the Iron Dome missile defense system completed its first successful operational interception against a short-range threat originating from the Gaza Strip . & nbsp ; Now , one decade later , it is time to analyze the decision-making process behind the system&rsquo;s development , some lessons learned from a decade of operations , and the prospects for further advancements and adaptations over the next decade , including potential future connection with laser solutions . & nbsp ; Iron Dome&rsquo;s unrivaled success on the battlefield & ndash ; which has even made it , in many people&rsquo;s eyes , the most important Israeli innovation in the country&rsquo;s 70 years of existence & ndash ; has produced countless articles , interviews , books and television programs on the path to develop the system and its progress over the years . & nbsp ; For the sake of history , those who made the decisions and developed the system , and for the purpose of drawing effective lessons for the future , it is essential that the record be set straight , and that the factual truth , albeit subjective , be known , as it primarily appears in the State Comptroller&rsquo;s report 59A . & nbsp ; Deciding to develop Iron Dome & nbsp ; In 1996 , Israel and the United States agreed to collaborate on Project THEL ( Tactical High-Energy Laser ) , mistakenly dubbed Nautilus ( America&rsquo;s earlier adventure in this technological field ) . From the start , the project was developed as a technological demonstrator . In 2001 , a series of tests was completed proving a laser beam can intercept a threat , but concluded that a chemical laser-based interception system was not suitable for operational deployment in Israel . Low operational preparedness ( technological reliability ) , complex logistics ( size , availability , repairs and transfer from site to site ) and environmental concerns were only a few of the many significant reasons why . & nbsp ; Israel and the US decided to plan another system , smaller and more portable , named MTHEL ( Mobile THEL ) . From this decision , it can be understood that the cessation of the THEL program was not in any way caused by Israel&rsquo;s exit from Lebanon , as some have argued . & nbsp ; From 2001 to 2005 , Israel and its American counterpart worked on the new collaboration but decided to discontinue it in 2005 while still in the planning stages , as per advice from the Defense Ministry&rsquo;s Directorate of Defense Research and Development ( DDR&amp;D ) director Shmuel Keren and assessments shared by numerous experts . It was believed this project would not lead to an operational weapons system given that there was no foreseeable future for a chemical laser-based system . It was clear that any future laser-based interception system would be based on a solid-state laser , but such technology would not be available for & ndash ; what proved to be optimistic & ndash ; at least another decade . & nbsp ; In the end , by 2005 , after roughly nine years of work and $ 600 million ( mostly funded by the US ) , the outcome was a technological demonstrator , impossible to duplicate or be used operationally on an American test field . Over the years , a series of interception tests was conducted on the system with an actual success rate of less than 50 % ( based on American official data ) . & nbsp ; Additionally , a detailed on-paper plan was designed for a small mobile system , MTHE . The idea , later dubbed SKYGUARD , was not yet created . SKYGUARD&rsquo;s status can also be deduced from a Northrop Grumman ( NG ) proposal submitted to DDR&amp;D down the road . The proposal required higher development costs than all of Iron Dome&rsquo;s development from zero . Statements contending that the THEL system could have been brought to Israel and operationalized , or that the MTHEL/SKYGUARD system was ready for production in 2005 were simply not factually accurate nor based in reality . This remains the case today , 15 years later . & nbsp ; In 2004 & ndash ; facing elevated threats , especially in southern Israel & ndash ; an interagency team was set up to draft solutions for defensive systems against short-range threats . This team , led by R&amp;D unit director Daniel Gold , issued a call for proposals and tested dozens of potential solutions . Eventually , at the end of 2005 , the team recommended developing a system based on Rafael&rsquo;s proposal ( with changes ) & ndash ; and it was named & ldquo;Iron Dome . & rdquo ; The proposal was approved by DDR&amp;D director Keren and a relatively small budget was allocated , out of the department&rsquo;s overall budget , and a partnership with Rafael that financially supports part of the R&amp;D efforts . & nbsp ; In 2006 , in light of the changing threat landscape & ndash ; with the Second Lebanon War and rockets launched into Israel serving as significant catalysts & ndash ; and inquiries by NG and other defense industries , Keren presented the proposed concepts to then-defense minister Amir Peretz , recommending Iron Dome . Peretz adopted the suggestion and even called for expedited development . However , there still was not a significant budget allocated to the project , & nbsp ; In October 2006 , after additional significant pressure , Keren appointed a professional committee led by his deputy Jacob Nagel , to test which solution would best protect Israel from short-range missile threats . The committee included dozens of internal and external experts in the fields of missiles , lasers , operational research and doctrine . Lt . - Col . Shachar Shohat & ndash ; who later achieved the rank of brigadier-general and served as commander of the Air Defense Forces & ndash ; served as the Air Force representative on the committee . & nbsp ; For three months , the Nagel Committee worked intensely to test all potential Israeli and international solutions . Finally , in December , the committee presented its findings and recommendations to Keren , to Defense Ministry director-general Gabi Ashkenazi and to Peretz , and they approved it . In February 2007 , these recommendations were presented to prime minister Ehud Olmert , who authorized them . & nbsp ; Israel&rsquo;s state comptroller noted , & ldquo;DDR&amp;D , through the work of the Nagel Committee , conducted an orderly process for testing alternatives , and presented the alternatives to different parties and noted the clear advantage with the Iron Dome system . Each of the parties & ndash ; the director-general , minister of defense , and prime minister & ndash ; approved DDR&amp;D&rsquo;s conclusions . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Peretz declared that the Iron Dome concept was proven , but would require additional external funding . Olmert explained that Iron Dome&rsquo;s development was unavoidable and directed the Defense Ministry to approach the Finance Ministry to allocate the needed budget . By June 2007 the project still had not received a substantial budget , and progressed with DDR&amp;D and Rafael R&amp;D budgets , increased by several dozens of millions of shekels from Peretz and acting director-general Yehiel Horev from the defense budget . & nbsp ; The Nagel Committee did not include the THEL system as a potential solution , given previous assessments casting doubt on its operational potential or relevance , and the inability to be duplicated . SKYGUARD , NG&rsquo;s solution , was examined in detail . During the process , NG&rsquo;s VP met with the DDR&amp;D director and thanked him & ndash ; in writing and in person & ndash ; for the opportunity to present the proposal to the committee . & nbsp ; In 2007 , upon taking office and facing lingering tension , defense minister Ehud Barak convened yet another hearing , calling for a re-presentation of the Nagel Committee findings and recommendations on each of the proposed solutions , including another external presentation of the SKYGUARD system . Barak then ratified these recommendations , declared development of Iron Dome as essential , and allocated the needed budget out of the Defense Ministry budget . & nbsp ; Following this approval , final negotiations were conducted with Rafael , the project was submitted to the government , and it was officially approved . In December 2007 , Rafael signed a contract with the Israeli government for the development and equipping of the first two Iron Dome batteries . & nbsp ; From this point , development of the project was expedited by Rafael , ELTA and M-Prest under a DDR&amp;D project team , led by then-Lt . - Col . Chicco with the close guidance of R&amp;D director Gold . & nbsp ; Simultaneously , an unprecedented lobbying campaign for SKYGUARD kicked off , drafting senior retired military officers , academics and media figures . This campaign led to serious incitement , with personal attacks lobbed at director-general Pinhas Buchris , DDR&amp;D director Keren and his deputy Nagel , who were dubbed the & ldquo;high-priests of Iron Dome&rdquo ; by the campaign . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The lobby&rsquo;s efforts included drafting PR experts , distributing marketing brochures , pushing defamation both online and in newspapers , and planning an approach to key US figures in an effort to harm the State of Israel . This was revealed in articles by Channel 11&rsquo;s Ayala Hasson and Channel 10&rsquo;s Raviv Drucker . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Buchris , Keren and Nagel were at the forefront of defending the decision to develop Iron Dome , while Gold and his team were working on developing the system with the industries . They held dozens of meetings with the leaders of Israel&rsquo;s northern and southern communities , ministers , MKs , members of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee , and members of the press and academia . Upon reviewing the factual data and decision-making process , almost every one of these individuals understood that they had been fed nothing but misinformation , and withdrew their support of the lobbying campaign . & nbsp ; As part of his efforts to defend the project , Buchris ( with Nagel ) traveled as part of a professional delegation to the US to see the THEL system in New Mexico . They met with representatives from NG and with relevant members of the US military who explained that the decision to stop development of the project was reached in consultation with Israel . Buchris returned to Israel more convinced than ever that the THEL system was not relevant , and they were completely in support of the decision-making process . & nbsp ; In 2008 , Barak met with US secretary of defense Robert Gates , and they discussed ways the US could support Israel in its attempts to protect the home front from high-trajectory missiles . This was largely motivated by America&rsquo;s desire to prevent Israel from entering a war with Gaza . As a result of these meetings , a joint committee led by DDR&amp;D&rsquo;s Nagel and US Gen . Robin Rand was formed to once again test each of the possible solutions ( Iron Dome , SKYGUARD , Vulcan Planks and other proposed laser systems ) . Again the conclusion was reached that only Iron Dome could sufficiently supply the defense needed for Israel&rsquo;s home front , while providing its leaders the freedom to act as needed . & nbsp ; The Nagel-Rand committee again determined that the SKYGUARD system , still only on paper , was not a suitable solution & ndash ; either for Israel or the US . As part of this committee , a delegation of US missile , radar , command and control , and laser experts arrived in Israel , conducted in-depth discussions and visited both DDR&amp;D and the Israeli defense industry . While the first visit started with marked skepticism surrounding the feasibility of developing the system , it ended with admiration for the system , but with expectation that the project would not be completed on time or within budget . Yet one year later during a subsequent visit , the delegation was enthralled by the pace of Iron Dome&rsquo;s development and advancements in solving technical problems . They released a professional report , optimistic on the project&rsquo;s success and keeping to the projected schedule and budget . & nbsp ; The Nagel-Rand Committee recommendations were presented to and subsequently approved by Keren , Buchris and Barak . They were then presented to relevant American stakeholders and resulted in then-president Barack Obama allocating $ 205 million in special assistance to the program . A central element of the committee&rsquo;s proposal insisted that assistance be limited to equipping the Iron Dome system in an effort to prevent any future potential export restrictions on the system and ensure development remained & ldquo;blue and white&rdquo ; in its entirety . & nbsp ; In the decade following that decision , the US significantly increased its financial contribution to equipping additional Iron Dome systems and launchers . Included in the 2016 Memorandum of Understanding between the US and Israel , pushed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Obama ( which entered into force in fiscal year 2019 ) , a new , special section was added allocating $ 500 million annually to ballistic missile defense , with the equipping of Iron Dome components being an important component thereof . & nbsp ; The past decade & ndash ; analysis and lessons learned & nbsp ; Today , the Iron Dome missile defense system is highly regarded in professional , political , military and civilian circles both in Israel and abroad , and has received numerous prizes and praise for its groundbreaking military innovation and success in saving lives . The term & ldquo;Iron Dome&rdquo ; has become ingrained in the Hebrew lexicon , synonymous with incredible success . & nbsp ; Despite its operational and technological success , those initial naysayers were not quick to mute themselves or their criticisms . At the tactical level , Iron Dome&rsquo;s operational capabilities were called into question , while at the strategic level , concerns were raised that the damage outweighed any benefit , especially given the negative impact on the national-level decision-making process and international legitimization . & nbsp ; They claimed that Iron Dome , with the passage of time , had become a burden rather than an asset and a double-edged sword . An academic research project conducted at the National Security College , guided by one of the authors of this article , analyzed Iron Dome&rsquo;s impact on the Israeli National Security Strategy & ndash ; economically , militarily , socially and politically . After a decade of operational experience and more than 2,500 successful interceptions , the research conclusively finds that the Iron Dome system is a first-class asset and clear barrier breaker , not remotely resembling a double-edged sword . Iron Dome often changes the decision-making process of Israel&rsquo;s political echelons , and our enemies&rsquo ; methods and tactics . & nbsp ; Iron Dome is a key element of Israel&rsquo;s multi-layered defense array , developed to protect the home front from incoming missile threats . While Iron Dome protects against short-range threats , the David&rsquo;s Sling system defends against mid-tier threats , and the Arrow systems defend against upper-tier threats . & nbsp ; The US Army , facing many threats similar to Israel , decided to procure two Iron Dome batteries as an interim solution while deciding what the most appropriate enduring solution would be for its needs . Simultaneously , the US Marines also expressed interest in the system and have conducted several successful tests in America . & nbsp ; The continued collaboration between Israel and the US in the development and equipping of Iron Dome contributes to strengthening the strategic and technological collaboration between the two countries and their defense of their respective civilians and service members . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; AS WE celebrate 10 years since Iron Dome&rsquo;s first interception , we are reminded of the importance of recalling the overall goals that led decision-makers to develop this system : & bull ; Life and limb : Save lives above all else , almost at any cost . & bull ; Strategic assets : Protect strategic facilities , military facilities and national infrastructure . & bull ; Economic defense : Reduce the amount of direct and indirect economic damage ( cost of property , human casualties and injuries ) and prevent interference with the economy and national gross production . & nbsp ; & bull ; Strategic flexibility : Provide additional options to political decision-makers by reducing the risk posed by incoming rockets . & bull ; Ability to act : Increase the military&rsquo;s freedom to act via the ability to carry out offensive operations free from the fear of retaliatory rocket attacks . & bull ; Confidence : Raise the national morale and spirit , decrease the psychological impact on the population caused by images of damage and destruction , especially in the age of social media . & nbsp ; IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS of relevant events of the past decade leads to determination of success on several levels , such as : & bull ; Economic perspective : A review of the past decade&rsquo;s economic data proves beyond all doubt that Iron Dome certainly stands up to the economic test . This is further supported with the realization that the comparison cannot be between the cost of the interceptor and the cost of a missile , but rather the total cost of a launch compared to the direct and indirect economic consequences resulting from incoming enemy missiles scoring direct hits . & bull ; Societal Perspective : Iron Dome , as an effective defense system , significantly contributes to Israel&rsquo;s sense of community and national pride . It contributes to Israel&rsquo;s degree of resilience by reducing overall levels of fear and anxiety , creating a unified home front with all its civilians feeling protected . In the battle over public opinion , the system also contributes to Israel&rsquo;s story of success over the enemy and improves overall morale both during and after periods of combat . However , it is also important to note that the system&rsquo;s past success creates a danger of an illusion of security to civilians . To prevent such negative surprises , it is essential that our leaders set reasonable expectations for citizens . Outlook for the next decade & nbsp ; Over the past decade , Iron Dome provided unprecedented superiority . During the next decade , we can expect enemies will respond with technological efforts of their own . All signs suggest they have already started , and thus there is no time to waste . Testing , improvements and adaptations of Iron Dome are constantly required as a way to ensure it maintains its legendary superiority . This is an endless battle in the fight between the threat and the interceptor . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Without getting into specifics , it is clear that every system has limitations and vulnerabilities . However , if we do not put forth every effort to further its innovation and renewal , our adversaries will detract from Iron Dome&rsquo;s effectiveness and superiority . There is no indefinitely hermetic defensive solution . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; We cannot rest on our laurels . We must consistently test the enemies&rsquo ; advancements and threat trends , and adapt our systems to achieve optimal effective defense , in order to maintain relevance on the future battlefield . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; ONE KEY area of interest is laser-based solutions . & nbsp ; During the Iron Dome decision-making process and continuously ever since , baseless allegations have been made related to the performance of laser-based systems versus kinetic interception-based systems using missiles . & nbsp ; Each solution has advantages and disadvantages that are important to raise and understand . Understanding the pros and cons of a laser-based system is especially important today , given the great progress recently made in Israel in technology development . & nbsp ; It is critical to correct some of the factually incorrect arguments in favor of transitioning to a laser-based system : & bull ; & ldquo;A laser-based interception system will prevent disruption to daily life , as it is an almost perfect and hermetic system . & rdquo ; Hermetic systems do not exist , and it is clear that with any system , daily routines will be disrupted . In any case , the performance of the missile-based systems seems to be better than those based on laser . & bull ; & ldquo;Laser systems will better handle barrage attacks . & rdquo ; Actually , the opposite is true and this is one of the most compelling disadvantages to a laser-based system , since such a system&rsquo;s primary role would be to handle a series of threats . Statements alleging & ldquo;interception at the speed of light&rdquo ; are misleading . While the beam can reach its target at the speed of light and notably faster than a missile , it must remain on each target for several seconds to destroy it ( how long cannot be revealed ) and largely depends on the threat variant , the strength of the beam and its distance from the target . The laser-based system would be quite limited in its abilities to counter attack salvos ( unless it could be built with multiple beams , meaning another system , which would substantially increase the overall cost ) . In multi-purpose missile-based systems , the missiles are launched independently , are operated simultaneously by the system and operate instantaneously on the target to counter incoming threats . & bull ; & ldquo;Laser systems don&rsquo;t require adaptations for new threats . & rdquo ; Laser-based systems are not robust , and each threat needs to be programmed for separately . & nbsp ; ON FEBRUARY 8 , 2020 , the Defense Ministry announced a groundbreaking technological achievement in the development of the solid-state laser . The depth and gravity of this achievement are noteworthy , as is its potential for strengthening Israel&rsquo;s low tactical defensive layer capabilities . The correct and planned use of this new technology adds to the interception capabilities in a newer , cheaper way , based on an understanding of its limitations . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; While this is a major advancement that allows for a demonstration of the system&rsquo;s battlefield capabilities , the full operational range of the system is still several years and hundreds of millions of shekels of development away . There is no doubt that the addition of a laser interceptor , alongside the classic Iron Dome interceptor , will improve overall performance and will also be beneficial to Israel&rsquo;s partners , including the US . & nbsp ; IN SUMMARY , after a decade of operational work of the Iron Dome system , it can be said that we must tip our hat to all those who have worked on this project over the past 15 years , the decision-making stages , development of the system , its integration and its transition into successful operationalization and use , through continuous improvements along the way . & nbsp ; That being said , Iron Dome is not yet complete , and it will likely continue for many years to come . Our enemies are learning the system all the time and without question they never cease to try to surprise us . The role of all those involved is to always be one step ahead of them .

2024-03-28 18:19:07.587,jpost,"The World Court of Justice unanimously ordered Israel , accused by South Africa of genocide in Gaza , to take all necessary and effective action to ensure basic food supplies to the enclave's Palestinian population and halt the spreading of famine.Judges at the World Court , also known as the International Court of Justice , said the Palestinians in Gaza face worsening conditions and famine and starvation were spreading . "" The court observes that Palestinians in Gaza are no longer facing only a risk of famine . . . but that famine is setting in , "" the judges said in their order . South Africa requested the new measures as part of its ongoing case that accuses Israel of state-led genocide in Gaza.There was no immediate comment from Israel's Foreign Ministry on the ruling . Israel has said it was making efforts to expand access for humanitarian aid to Gaza overland , through airdrops and by ship to the enclave's Mediterranean coast.Spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Thursday afternoon that the State Department will review the ICJ order before reacting . "" But as a general proposition , of course , increasing humanitarian assistance to Gaza is something that we support and something that we have urged Israel to help facilitate , "" Miller said.However , Miller was clear in saying that the US does not believe a genocide has taken place or that it's an appropriate or constructive term to use in this instance.In January , the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) , also known as the World Court , ordered Israel to refrain from any acts that could fall under the Genocide Convention and to ensure its troops commit no genocidal acts against Palestinians after South Africa accused Israel of state-led genocide in Gaza.Ireland said on Wednesday it would intervene in South Africa's genocide case against Israel . Foreign Minister Micheal Martin announced the move.Martin did not say what form the intervention would take or outline any argument or proposal Ireland plans to put forward.Israel and its Western allies described the allegation as baseless . A final ruling in South Africa's ICJ case in The Hague could take years.Israel Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lior Haiat posted to X , saying "" As has been repeatedly affirmed , Israel is committed to international law , including with respect to allowing and facilitating the transfer of essential humanitarian aid to the civilian population in the Gaza Strip .

Nderitu called for the full implementation of the resolutions . "" This war , together with its attendant suffering , needs to end , and needs to end now , said Nderitu in a press statement . "" Those responsible for hindering humanitarian access and for hate speech , dehumanizing , and inciteful language must be held to account , "" she added .

( res . ) Yaron Buskila spoke recently with Yoav Minitz on Radio North 104.5FM and referred to the future of the conflict with the terrorist organization Hezbollah on the northern border.Buskila stated , "" The North is facing the issue of UAVs , which seems like a kind of Russian roulette . How can the security system deal with this . "" To explain why occasionally there are no sirens , Hezbollah learned to operate with UAVs at a low altitude close to the ground . Because of this , the UAV is not identified , and Hezbollah manages to operate them and attack before the Israeli detection and identification system operates . This has become a challenge for us , but we continue to face Hezbollah as we have in recent years in a symmetrical manner . For every attack they launch at us , we retaliate proportionally . "" This is not how to deal with a terror organization , certainly not at this stage . Hezbollah understands that we are in negotiations over the hostages , and they want to pressure the State of Israel . We must not play into their hands . This is exactly the time to take action against Hezbollah and Lebanon as a country and attack civilian infrastructures . Hezbollah is also subject to social and public pressure within Lebanon . "" Which infrastructures and targets are worth it for Israel to attack ? & nbsp ; "" If we do not know how to attack such civilian infrastructures that the Lebanese society will put pressure on Hezbollah , we will not come out of this . We needed to escalate matters long ago . The economic interest they had with the gas agreement needs to be canceled immediately and transferred to our hands as one of the first steps in response to Hezbollah's activities . The economy in Lebanon is so fragile that the last thing they need is escalation and entry into a war from Israel , which will destroy the Lebanese economy.Buskila continued , "" We are at war . Any target within Lebanon that causes pressure on Lebanese society is legitimate . It could be an airport , energy areas , and others . These are part of the steps taken in war , and we are at war . We are in a fateful year that will determine the future of the State of Israel in terms of security in the next 50 years . The sharper this war becomes and the more significant the achievements , the more peace we will acquire in the coming years . "" "" The State of Israel and the security system are afraid to carry out attacks for fear that Hezbollah may achieve long-range targets , farther than Haifa and Hadera .

2024-06-20 23:28:51.157,jpost,"Maccabi Tel Aviv ended a turbulent season in the best possible way this week as it wrapped up the franchise&rsquo;s 57th championship after defeating Hapoel Tel Aviv 2-1 in what will go down as back-to-back titles for the yellow-and-blue over its city rival.In what was a heated series , both on and off the court , that unfortunately saw a tremendous amount of fan violence in the shadow of the war against Hamas , Maccabi&rsquo;s coach , Oded Katash , was able to steer his ship to the promised land.As the campaign came to an end and Maccabi hoisted the championship plate in front of its home crowd , Katash spent some time following the game to take a look back at the entire year and the challenges that he will need to deal with in the upcoming days , weeks and months.The country&rsquo;s winningest franchise began the 2023/24 campaign way back in August , when the majority of the prior year&rsquo;s roster of players returned to the country to start training camp with an air of optimism that this would be a historic and unforgettable year.With a returning core of star veterans , including Wade Baldwin and Lorenzo Brown as well as budding forwards Bonzie Colson and Roman Sorkin , to go along with newcomers Jasiel Rivero and Tamir Blatt , Maccabi was set to be the talk of the town and challenge for the Euroleague crown.Maccabi looked superb in its opening Euroleague game against Partizan Belgrade at Yad Eliyahu on Thursday , October 5 as hopes were very high that the club would once again reach the top of the continental basketball world.However , that was before October 7 occurred , and Hamas&rsquo;s attack on the Jewish State set off a chain of effects that turned the former reality upside down.The yellow-and-blue had to pivot quickly as the import players and their families were flown out of the country , and after a very short break Belgrade became the club&rsquo;s new temporary home . & ldquo;It was a difficult year , regardless of basketball , & rdquo ; Katash began . & ldquo;We are citizens of the country and it has been quite an experience that we are going through . This one season felt like three or four years and in addition to what happened with my good friend and coach Lior Lubin who passed away , it was intense and very complex . Every day there was something that happened and perhaps my character is sometimes a disadvantage in these situations , but maybe it was an advantage . & rdquo;In addition to his own mental make-up , Katash referenced his players&rsquo ; strengths . & ldquo;If we didn&rsquo;t have continuity in the roster from last year , we wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to survive this entire situation . We had a tough schedule but we were able to do it with the character of the players and building upon what we had started last season . & rdquo;The prevailing thought was that Maccabi would fall apart without its home crowd to cheer it on and a successful Euroleague campaign was at that point too lofty an expectation . But that was not the case as the players and staff pulled it together and ended up in seventh place with an impressive 20-14 record , earning it a place in the Play-In . After easily disposing of Baskonia , Panathinaikos was up next for Maccabi as it took the eventual Euroleague champs to five games before falling in Athens.Local victoryLocally , the yellow-and-blue won game after game in the domestic league throughout the winter months but ended up falling in the State Cup final to Hapoel Jerusalem in a game that took place just days after the club&rsquo;s continental campaign came to an end . & ldquo;When you win a title it&rsquo;s always great , but this season was extra special after everything we had experienced . After we ended Europe we were really done and we had so many injuries and situations that we paid a price for , whether it was the war or personal issues of the players as well . After we lost the cup , the players really didn&rsquo;t want to finish this season that way . In some ways , everything went against us but we also have to look at things in proportion as there are still hostages in Gaza . & rdquo;Katash&rsquo;s charges pulled it all together in their league quarterfinal series against Ness Ziona , which resulted in a sweep that was followed up by another walkover versus Jerusalem , which was without injured star Levi Randolph ( now rumored to be coming to Maccabi ) . Hapoel Tel Aviv looked to avenge last year&rsquo;s final series loss , but once again the Reds came up short and Maccabi captured yet another title.While the yellow-and-blue can bask in championship glory , the celebrations will be short lived as it will need to start rebuilding the roster for the 24/25 season that is right around the corner and there will be plenty of changes coming , from both imports to Israelis.Baldwin and Brown swiftly declared that they will be leaving the team due to the war , with their announcements coming as they were still on the floor celebrating.Josh Nebo&rsquo;s contract is up and he will be departing while Bonzie Colson is still undecided as to where he will suit up next season . Baldwin , Brown and Colson all have contracts for the 24/25 campaign with Maccabi , but the club will not stand in their way should they want to leave.Katash of course would love for them to all stay but the reality is that they will be heading to other teams . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s sad to lose them and break up the team and it&rsquo;s really sad actually . But what has occurred here this season in the country , it&rsquo;s part of the price that we have to pay . What happened on October 7 is the biggest incident that I&rsquo;ve witnessed in my lifetime and we have to take things into proportion . & rdquo;Rivero should be back , and the same may be true of Antonius Cleveland , howevervJames Webb will likely be looking for a new home next season.As for the Israeli contingent , Rafi Menco is a free agent but should return , Josh DiBartoloemo and Jake Cohen are under contract and should be back playing at Yad Eliyahu next season , while Tamir Blatt is opting out of his current contract but will most likely re-sign with the team at a higher rate.The one big question is the league and finals MVP , Sorkin . The big man is rumored to be heading to North America to try out for NBA teams after a stellar season , but there is also talk that Maccabi will make him an offer that he can&rsquo;t refuse and he will stay yellow-and-blue for the foreseeable future . & ldquo;Roman won every award this season , & rdquo ; Katash said . & ldquo;I have the privilege of coaching him . He can really do it all and has a huge upside and is one of the most talented players . He&rsquo;s a great person as well and I&rsquo;m very proud as to how he came into the playoffs . He was playing well in the Euroleague , but then got hurt and it just took time to get him back up to speed . He needs to be a Maccabi Tel Aviv player for the rest of his career . & rdquo;There are plenty of names that have been linked to Maccabi and while the Euroleague home games will most probably be played once again in Belgrade , the club still remains a very attractive option for some players , explained the bench boss . & ldquo;Next season won&rsquo;t be easy and it was a challenge this year just in terms of scheduling . But Maccabi is a big club and has a system in place and while it won&rsquo;t be easy to keep players and sign players , we are there . & ldquo;We know we will lose some players but there are plenty of players who see Maccabi as an opportunity . Maccabi is a good place to play and a place where players can advance their careers . & rdquo;It seems that the yellow-and-blue is doing exactly that , finding players who want to come play for Maccabi that have experienced Israel . Those may include Hapoel Jerusalem&rsquo;s Randolph , Hapoel Holon big man Justin Smith along with Hapoel Tel Aviv&rsquo;s center Jaylen Hoard , to name a few.The upcoming campaign will be complex and challenging without a doubt , but the most important thing for Maccabi will be to be able to adapt on the fly and adjust as it did this season . & ldquo;There are a lot of question marks . In this chaotic reality , it is impossible to know what the day will bring . Things change all the time , we have to adjust ourselves & ndash ; because we are heading into a difficult year . & rdquo ;",katash reflects on maccabi tel aviv’s chaotic campaign

The Movement for Quality Government filed a similar complaint in March , calling for the rabbi&rsquo;s removal from the Great Rabbinical Court of Appeals in a letter to Uri Shoham , the Israeli judiciary&rsquo;s ombudsman.The letter accused Yosef of overstepping his role by supporting the attempt to prevent the enactment of legislation that would force ultra-Orthodox youth to perform military service . Yosef was reported to have said that if there is a change from the status quo whereby exemption from military service will no longer be valid , ultra-Orthodox youth will leave the country in droves . As a public servant who receives his salary from the state , Yosef spoke out of turn , and what he said was a form of incitement . He has since stated that he was misunderstood , but to no avail . There have been calls for his ouster and for the retraction of the award . There have also been demonstrations against him.As has happened in the past , the question arises as to whether a person should be judged only for achievements in the category in which he or she has been named as an Israel Prize winner or whether the awarding of the prize should also be based on that person&rsquo;s behavior and political and religious views and affiliations.Empty seats on Passover at the Great Synagogue ■ ONE OF the most demoralizing things that could happen during a pilgrim festival , such as Passover , is to attend services at the majestic Jerusalem Great Synagogue and see that most of the seats are empty.There could be several reasons for this.One is that people slept in after the Seder , having gone to bed at midnight or later . Another is that , due to numerous flight cancellations , many of the thousands of evacuees transferred to Jerusalem after October 7 have returned to their homes , leaving no tourists to replace them . Yet another is the police warning following the terrorist attack in Jerusalem just ahead of the holiday ; fear may have kept some people at home.But , as always , the inspiring Great Synagogue choir , with its wide vocal range that accompanied Cantor Tzvi Weiss and was conducted by Elli Jaffe , was top-notch , even though it&rsquo;s somewhat disconcerting that Weiss sings in the Ashkenazi pronunciation of Hebrew . Latecomers began to file in after the Bible reading , more so in the men&rsquo;s section than in the women&rsquo;s , but there were still far too many empty seats in both.In nearby France Square , a long , symbolic Seder table had been set with artistically folded yellow paper napkins on each plate , empty wine bottles , and dead flowers . Each chair had a large photograph of a hostage , affixed with his or her name , sending a powerful message . The symbolic high chair at the head of the table , which bore the portrait of Kfir Bibas , the youngest of the hostages , was especially poignant . & nbsp;The fact that the high chair was at the head of the table was reminiscent of the prophet Isaiah&rsquo;s vision , which , in addition to including the wolf dwelling with the lamb and the leopard with the young goat and the lion , spoke of a small child who would lead them . & nbsp;Though each and every hostage is equally important , none has captured as much sympathy as Kfir Bibas , whose first birthday on January 18 was spent in captivity in Gaza.The venue for the symbolic Seder was appropriate in that there are synagogues within the distance of a kilometer in all directions , representing most streams of Judaism . Prayers and special psalms for the hostages have been incorporated into synagogue services.Hamas's hostage video ■ THE VIDEO of Hersh Goldberg-Polin that was released by Hamas last week and the timing of the release may possibly be attributed to two factors . One is that he is a dual national , holding American and Israeli citizenship , and the other is that his mother , Rachel Goldberg-Polin , was included in Time Magazine&rsquo;s list of the 100 most influential people . Goldberg-Polin has been extremely active in the campaign by hostage families for the return of their loved ones to Israel.Unfortunately , because the date of the video is unknown , no one knows the true state of Hersh&rsquo;s health . But what matters is that , hopefully , he&rsquo;s alive , and unlike so many other parents who have no idea whether their sons and daughters are alive , the Goldberg-Polins have at least received a sign , and they can play the video over and over again . It is so terribly important for hostage families to keep getting the word out , not just because they want more people to understand what has happened and to imagine what it would be like if one of their loved ones were captured by Hamas , but because Gilad Shalit had been heartened during his captivity by hearing on the radio that his family and the Israel government had not given up on him . His captors had allowed him to listen to the radio from time to time , which is why the messages of relatives of the hostages are rebroadcast several times a day , and the message always includes all the hostages , assuring them that the efforts for their release are ongoing without let-up.Meanwhile , news of the release of the video , which was the first sign of life that Hersh Goldberg Polin&rsquo;s family have received since October 7 , prompted a spontaneous demonstration near the prime minister&rsquo;s residence in Jerusalem with a demand to resume negotiations for the return of the hostages . The number of demonstrators quickly swelled into the hundreds , necessitating police intervention . Police pushed the crowd back into France Square , where the noise level was much louder than at demonstrations last year.Tribute to the Dayan family ■ THE FINAL resting place of members of the famed Dayan family , whose contributions to the nation have been military , political , literary , and dramatic , includes Assi Dayan , the celebrated actor and filmmaker , who died on May 1 , 2014 , and his cousin Yehonatan Geffen , the author , poet , songwriter , journalist , satirist , and playwright who died on April 19 , 2023.Because Nahalal was home to so many well-known personalities , the cemetery , like the Trumpeldor Cemetery in Tel Aviv , is embedded in the nature of a tourist site , where the names on the tombstones are linked to the evolving history of the state.Writing in Maariv , the sister publication of The Jerusalem Post , journalist Lior Dayan , in paying tribute to his father Assi , who unfortunately was a drug addict , observes that so often , when a parent dies , his or her children say they regret that there are so many things they never got around to telling them . But that was not the case with him and his father , Lior wrote . They told each other everything , candidly and without secrets . At the start of the lengthy article , he mentions how the tour guide&rsquo;s anecdotes about the Dayan family captivate the tourist groups that visit the cemetery . On a recent visit to his father&rsquo;s grave , he overheard a boy , standing with his mother , asking in relation to Assi , & ldquo;So , what did he do ? & rdquo ; & ldquo;He did a lot , & rdquo ; she replied . & ldquo;A lot of good or a lot of bad ? & rdquo ; he persisted . & ldquo;A lot of good for the public ; a lot of bad for himself , & rdquo ; she answered.In Lior&rsquo;s opinion , this was the most succinct and definitive summing up of who his father was.Aliza Bloch's new book ■ POLITICAL LEADERS who lose to their opponents quickly learn that there is life beyond the corridors of power . Aliza Bloch , the immediate past mayor of Beit Shemesh , despite an intensely busy schedule during her period in office , nonetheless found time to prepare her new book , Bridges of Light , which she launched this month in the presence of Minister without Portfolio Chili Troper and several past and present politicians , including members of the Beit Shemesh Municipal Council , as well as other well-known figures.ANZAC Day in Israel ■ ANZAC DAY , which commemorates the ill-fated dawn landing in Gallipoli by Australian and New Zealand troops on April 25 , 1915 , has for many years been a day of remembrance for all the Australian and New Zealand soldiers who died in the line of duty . In Israel , the ANZAC Day service is traditionally held at the Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Jerusalem at a reasonable hour of the morning , though one of the recent Australian ambassadors insisted on a dawn service . It is usually hosted by the Australian ambassador and attended by military attach&eacute;s & ndash ; and , occasionally , by ambassadors of the Allied Forces that fought in the First World War & ndash ; as well as by representatives of the Turkish and German embassies . This year , due to the current security situation and the Passover holiday , the service was shorter than in past years , and instead of being held in Jerusalem , it took place at the Ramleh War Cemetery on Thursday of last week at the reasonable hour of 9.30 a.m . Kudos to Australian Ambassador Ralph King for refraining from a dawn service.greerfc@gmail.com","grapevine april 28 , 2024 : israel prize disputes"
2021-08-01 19:30:01.967,jpost,"& nbsp;Palestinian armed groups have called for mass protests as the High Court is scheduled on Monday to issue a ruling on an appeal against the eviction of Palestinian families from their homes in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah . & nbsp ; Lower courts had ruled that several homes in Sheikh Jarrah , known in Hebrew as Shimon HaTzadik , were owned by Jews before 1948 . The planned evictions of the triggered widespread protests in the neighborhood and other parts of Jerusalem over the past few months . & nbsp ; Last week , The Jerusalem Post revealed that Prime Minister Naftali Bennet does not plan to evict the families even of the High Court makes it possible . Sources close to Bennet said that they did not expect the court to order the government to enforce any eviction order or to impose a deadline . & nbsp ; A statement issued by several Palestinian armed groups on Sunday called on the Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem to & ldquo;ignite the flame of resistance under the feet of the Zionist occupiers . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;The occupation&rsquo;s aggression against our people in Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah is increasing , & rdquo ; the statement read . & ldquo;In addition , the aggression against the families threatened with displacement continues . The crimes of the occupation have not stopped . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Voicing & ldquo;full solidarity&rdquo ; with the Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank , the terror groups said that they will defend them as they did during the & ldquo;Sword of Jerusalem&rdquo ; battle , the name Hamas uses to describe its 11-day war with Israel last May . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The resistance groups that defended the people of Jerusalem and the West Bank will not fail them , & rdquo ; the groups added . & ldquo;We call on our people in the West Bank and Jerusalem to continue to ignite the flame of resistance at all points of contact with the Zionist occupier , and to ignite the occupied land under the feet of the Zionist usurpers . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Mohammed Hamadeh , a spokesperson for Hamas , warned Israel against & ldquo;playing with fire&rdquo ; regarding the possible eviction of the Sheikh Jarrah families . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The Palestinian people , who refuse to give up and surrender , will continue to resist all attempts by the occupier [ to evict the families ] , & rdquo ; Hamadeh said . & ldquo;We are ready to respond to the aggression of the occupation . What the resistance groups did not allow in the past , they will not allow today or tomorrow . The occupation must learn the lesson and stop tampering with the Jerusalem neighborhoods . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Hamas official accused Israel of planning to & ldquo;Judaize&rdquo ; Jerusalem and expel the Palestinians from the city . & nbsp ; Fatah activists in east Jerusalem also called for protests on Monday in solidarity with the Sheikh Jarrah families . & nbsp ; On the eve of the court ruling , Palestinian Authority Minister of Jerusalem Affairs , Fadi al-Hidmi , warned that any decision to evict the Palestinian families & ldquo;would bring matters back to square one . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The case of the Sheikh Jarrah families has reached & ldquo;a critical and dangerous situation that requires urgent intervention by the international community , to prevent matters from returning to square one , & rdquo ; Hidmi cautioned . & nbsp ; He accused the Israeli government of presenting the case as a dispute over real estate and claimed that what is happening in Sheikh Jarrah is & ldquo;a political issue par excellence . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Israeli government&rsquo;s attempts to show that this is a legal dispute over real estate & ldquo;will not deceive anyone , & rdquo ; Hidmi said . & ldquo;The whole world knows that the issue is political , and that what is happening is an attempt to replace the original owners of the land with settlers . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The PA official said that the Palestinians do not trust the Israeli courts which , he claimed , & ldquo;serve as an executive tool&rdquo ; that works for the benefit of the Israeli government and settlers . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The international community , especially the US , the European Union and the United Nations , must be firm in rejecting the displacement plans , & rdquo ; Hidmi continued . & ldquo;We do not rely on the Israeli courts , and we believe that only firm and decisive international intervention can force the Israeli government to reverse its decisions . Any decision to evict families from their homes will bring matters back to square one and undermine all international efforts that have been made in the past months . & rdquo ;",terror groups : ignite fire of resistance at zionists for sheikh jarrah
2024-06-21 12:09:18.443,jpost,"The coalition&rsquo;s bloc is down to 48 mandates should there be elections now , according to a poll conducted for Maariv by Lazar Research . This is against the backdrop of the northern border tensions , the continued IDF operation in Rafah , and tensions in the government on the haredi draft and rabbi bills.The opposition bloc rose to 62 mandates , without two Arab-led parties , which would allow it , should it stay united , to formulate a coalition without being dependent on the Islamic Ra&rsquo;am Party.The poll , led by Dr . Menachem Lazar , shows the left-wing Meretz Party rising above the electoral threshold with four mandates while the Religious Zionist Party , led by led by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , remains below the threshold , with only 2.7 % support.The National Unity Party , led by former emergency government minister-without-portfolio Benny Gantz , dropped by one mandate from the previous poll and stands at 23 mandates.The poll , conducted in partnership with Panel4All , found that Likud is one step below National Unity with 22 mandates & ndash ; one more than the previous poll & ndash ; while Yesh Atid went from 15 to 16 mandates , Yisrael Beytenu stayed at a steady 14 , as did Shas with 10.For several weeks , the far-Right Otzma Yehudit Party has been polling at nine mandates , United Torah Judaism at seven ; the Labor Party at five ; and Hadash-Ta&rsquo;al and Ra&rsquo;am , both at five.Who should be the next prime minister of Israel?Of those polled , 42 % believe that Benny Gantz is the most suitable candidate for prime minister , while 35 % support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . The remaining 23 % are still undecided.Among right-wing voters , 2 % favor Gantz , and 90 % favor Netanyahu ; among center-left voters , 84 % are for Gantz and 3 % are for Netanyahu ; and among Arab party voters , 47 % are for Gantz and 0 % are for Netanyahu.The poll was conducted on Wednesday among 510 respondents , constituting a representative sample of the adult population in Israel , Jews and Arabs alike.The maximum sampling error is 4.4 % .","gap between netanyahu , gantz is closing ; should pm be worried ? - poll"
2024-03-06 03:54:30.543,jpost,"After more than 30 years in office as mayor of Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim , Benny Kashriel was psyching himself up to move to Rome as Israel&rsquo;s next ambassador to Italy.In recent years , Kashriel had been offered several opportunities to get out of local politics and into the Knesset . But he wasn&rsquo;t interested . Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim was the love of his life , and he was happy to stay there and devote all his energies to its development.But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former foreign minister Eli Cohen had other plans for him , and persuaded him to enter the diplomatic corps . As a loyal Likudnik , Kashriel could refuse for only so long.But there&rsquo;s one major obstacle by way of geography . Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim is located in the West Bank . That hasn&rsquo;t deterred some leftists from living there , but it is a red rag to Italy , which declines to accept a West Bank & ldquo;settler&rdquo ; as an ambassador in Rome.Even though he was not due to take up the appointment till well into the summer , at this stage of the game Kashriel cannot go back to being mayor , even though there are plenty of residents of Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim who would like to see him in that position.Hungary was mentioned as a possible alternative , but the next ambassador to Hungary has been approved both by Jerusalem and Budapest.The ideal situation would be for Israel to establish diplomatic relations with another country , and to accord Kashriel the honor of being Israel&rsquo;s first ambassador there . But given Israel&rsquo;s loss of popularity over events in Gaza , it&rsquo;s unlikely for a new diplomatic relationship to materialize in the foreseeable future.Quickly forgotten&nbsp ; ■ ONE OF the sad things about public figures is that once they resign or retire , they are quickly forgotten.A case in point is Moshe Mizrahi , who in the course of a long career served as director-general of both the offices of the president and the prime minister , and met scores of local and foreign dignitaries while safeguarding the interests of five prime ministers and two presidents . Mizrahi&rsquo;s successors began to capture the interest of the media , and Mizrahi was all but forgotten , except by veteran journalists and by leading figures of his generation.Like many people who have led exciting and meaningful lives , and who have made significant contributions to the histories of their respective nations , Mizrahi decided to write a memoir , which he launched at the Peres Center for Peace and Innovation , where speakers included retired Supreme Court justice Elyakim Rubinstein , MK Avigdor Liberman , who has known Mizrahi for some 30 years , Matan Vilna&rsquo;i , a former deputy chief of staff of the IDF , politician , and diplomat , and Efrat Duvdevani , the director-general of the Peres Center.All four spoke of Mizrahi&rsquo;s strong sense of patriotism , his dedication , and his important contribution to the nation and its security.Mizrahi also took a copy of his book to the President&rsquo;s Residence and personally presented to President Isaac Herzog , who , as the son and nephew of several of the nation&rsquo;s dignitaries , was familiar with episodes and people mentioned in the book , and enjoyed reading about them as he skimmed through it.Abducted Holocaust historian named honoree of the 2024 Jan Karski Eagle Award&nbsp ; ■ The Jan Karski Society has named abducted Holocaust historian Alex Dancyg as the honoree of the Jan Karski Eagle Award for 2024.In May 2000 , only two months before his death , Karski established the award to be presented to people who have distinguished themselves by defending human rights , speaking out against aggression and on behalf of the integrity of ethnic and religious groups and sovereign nations.A Polish soldier , member of the Resistance during the Second World War , diplomat , academic , and author , Karski was captured by the Gestapo and tortured . He was smuggled out of prison , and , in an attempt to stop the Holocaust , traveled to Britain and the United States , to tell Allied leaders of what the Nazis had done to Poland and how they were exterminating the Jews of Europe.He migrated to the US after the war , but his heart remained in Poland , where he was always held in high esteem , as he was in Israel , where he was named Righteous Among the Nations and was awarded honorary citizenship.Warsaw-born Dancyg , who was associated with Yad Vashem , and who led many groups to Poland and facilitated dialogue between Polish and Israeli youth , was abducted by Hamas from his home at Kibbutz Nir Oz and taken to Gaza . Both Poland and Israel mounted campaigns for his return.Dancyg was mentioned by President Andrzej Duda at the traditional Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw.Speaking in the presence of Poland&rsquo;s Chief Rabbi Michael Schudrich and Israeli Ambassador Yacov Livne , Duda noted that the Hanukkah candle-lighting tradition had been inaugurated by president Lech Kaczynski on December 18 , 2006 , and had taken place annually ever since.Duda said he is glad that after the Holocaust and other tragedies , citizens of Poland had over the past 30 years experienced the restoration of Jewish traditions and Jewish culture.Dancyg is not the first member of the Jewish faith to be considered deserving of the Jan Karski award . Others have included anti-Communist dissident Adam Michnik , former director of the Anti-Defamation League Abe Foxman , former president and prime minister Shimon Peres , and author , philosopher and Holocaust survivor Eli Wiesel.Canceling the Israel Prize categories ■ IT&rsquo;S AMAZING the extent to which Education Minister Yoav Kisch manages to get himself into hot water . Up until now he has managed to extricate himself , but it will take a lot more effort this time , with his decision to cancel the Israel Prize awards in a year in which Israel most definitely needs a morale booster.But worse than the cancellation itself is the reason for it & ndash ; the fact that the Science Prize was to be awarded to Eyal Waldman , one of the most outspoken critics of Netanyahu and the planned judicial reform.Initially , Kisch wanted to simply cancel the category . But then he declared that because Israel is at war , it would be inappropriate to hold the Israel Prize awards ceremony this year.Why ? So many other events that are traditionally held on Independence Day will be held as usual . Look how many events are being held around the country for International Women&rsquo;s Day.Aside from that , if Kisch wanted to cancel or postpone the Israel Prize awards ceremony , why did he not do so months ago ? Why wait till the adjudicating committee&rsquo;s choice of Waldman was made public ? Why humiliate a bereaved father whose daughter Danielle and her boyfriend were murdered by Hamas?Previous Israel Prize scandals ■ SOMETHING AS honorable as the Israel Prize should not be marred by scandal . Unfortunately , the current episode is not the first or even the second.In 1992 , Emile Habibi , an Arab politician who was also a gifted writer , was awarded the Israel Prize for Arabic literature.Arab nationalists pressured him not to accept it , but Habibi , who two years earlier had been awarded the Al Quds Prize for literature , argued that his being awarded the Israel Prize signified official recognition of a national culture , adding that a dialogue over prizes was preferable to arguing over stones and bullets.There were many Jews who also objected to Habibi receiving the Israel Prize , so much so that right-wing die-hard Yuval Neeman , who had received the Israel Prize for physics in 1969 , returned it in 1992 to emphasize his displeasure.There was also a scandal the following year , in 1993 , when Yeshayahu Leibowitz , a controversial , outspoken Orthodox philosopher and scientist , was selected to receive the Israel Prize . Leibowitz had urged Israeli soldiers to refuse orders that would in any way be harmful to peaceful Palestinians . Yitzhak Rabin , who was then prime minister , declared that he would not attend the ceremony if Leibowitz was to receive the prize.Unwilling to fan the flames of controversy on the most important national day of the year , Leibowitz declined to accept the prize.The year 2021 was an uncomfortable one for Yoav Gallant , who was then education minister , with two Israel Prize scandals on his hands.One of the people selected for the prize was Yehuda Meshi-Zahav , a haredi and former anti-Zionist activist who founded ZAKA and changed his attitude to the extent of sending his sons to the army.But after it was announced that Gallant had informed him of his selection for the Israel Prize , stories began to surface about years of sexual abuse that Meshi-Zahav had inflicted on both religious and secular women.As police began their investigations , Meshi-Zahav decided to forgo the prize and also resigned from ZAKA . He subsequently tried to commit suicide , but was rescued by one of his sons . However , he remained in a coma for more than a year before he died.In 2021 , Prof . Oded Goldreich of the Weizmann Institute of Science was also selected to be awarded the Israel Prize . His category was mathematics . But Gallant refused to accept the recommendation of the jury , alleging that Goldreich supported the Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions movement.Goldreich denied the allegation , stating that all he had done was to add his signature to those on a petition calling on the EU to halt its funding to Ariel University , which is located in the West Bank.The jury petitioned the High Court of Justice on Goldreich&rsquo;s behalf , and fellow Prof . David Harel , who was among the Israel Prize winners in 2004 , offered to share his prize with Goldreich.Yifat Shasha-Biton , who had succeeded Gallant as education minister , agreed with his decision on Goldreich . But a month later , Avichai Mandelblit , who was then the attorney-general , told the High Court that in his opinion the prize should be awarded to Goldreich.In March 2022 , the court ruled that the prize should be awarded to Goldreich , who eventually received the prize in a private ceremony at the Education Ministry , and announced that he would donate the prize money of NIS 75,000 to five human rights organizations , including Breaking the Silence.Netanyahu would earn brownie points if he made a public statement to the effect that the Israel Prize is awarded on merit in a certain field , and that it should in no way be influenced by political considerations.He should add that even though he and Waldman are at complete odds politically , he recognizes Waldman&rsquo;s contribution to technology , and will be pleased to congratulate him on that issue at the Israel Prize ceremony.Israeli professor awarded world&rsquo;s most prestigious prize for brain research ■ AS PRIZES go , the media are , of course , focused on the Israel Prize , and in paying so much attention , some media outlets may overlook the fact that an Israeli has been awarded the world&rsquo;s most prestigious prize for brain research.Prof . Haim Sompolinsky , a physicist and neuroscience researcher at the Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Neuroscience at the Hebrew University and professor at the Center for Brain Science at Harvard University , is the first Israeli scientist to receive The Brain Prize , which is awarded by the Lundbeck Foundation to pioneers in the field of neuroscience . He shares the & euro;1.3 million prize with Prof . Larry Abbott of Columbia University and Prof . Terrence Sejnowski of the Salk Institute.Sompolinsky is widely acclaimed for his groundbreaking work in theoretical and computational neuroscience , particularly in the study of neural circuit dynamics in the brain . His research has significantly contributed to the understanding of how neural circuits process and encode information , map the external world , and participate in learning and memory . Through a combination of theoretical and computational approaches , his work has elucidated key computational principles underlying brain function.The Brain Prize , initiated in 2011 and awarded annually by the Lundbeck Foundation , is considered the most prestigious award in neuroscience . It recognizes researchers whose work has advanced the field , from fundamental research to clinical applications . Sompolinsky&rsquo;s research not only deepens the knowledge of the brain&rsquo;s inner workings but also holds promise for applications in brain-inspired artificial intelligence.In congratulating Sompolinsky , Hebrew University President Prof . Asher Cohen stated : & ldquo;Prof . Sompolinsky&rsquo;s Brain Prize triumph is a testament to his pioneering contributions in computational neuroscience , unraveling neural circuit dynamics and laying the foundation for insights into information processing . His groundbreaking work inspires artificial intelligence , blending experimentation and theory to illuminate fundamental computational principles in brain function . & ldquo;This recognition not only honors his exceptional achievements but serves as a beacon guiding us toward further revelations at the intersection of neuroscience and computation . & rdquo;Sompolinsky and his two colleagues will receive the 2024 Brain Prize at a ceremony in Copenhagen in June.Brain Prize recipients were previously presented with their awards by the crown prince of Denmark , who is now king . It is not yet known whether he will continue to do so in his role as monarch.Sompolinsky is the son of the late Prof . David Sompolinsky , who was born in Denmark , and whose personal history was one that pointed not only to academic success but also to heroism . Together with friends from the Danish underground , he saved hundreds of Danish Jews from Nazi persecution in October 1943 by smuggling them on fishing boats to a safe haven in Sweden.Shai Piron calls on haredim to enlist ■ FORMER EDUCATION minister Shai Piron , who is religious and studied in several yeshivot before , during , and after his service in the IDF , has lost friends , colleagues , and students in the war against Hamas . He has called on haredim to enlist & ldquo;because we need you . & rdquo;Haredim have been extremely active in numerous civilian operations on behalf of soldiers and evacuees . If they could take time out from Torah studies , simply to do good , why not to defend?Then again , some haredi men who have enlisted , because they understood the meaning of mutual responsibility , have been disappointed by not being called to fight after a year&rsquo;s intensive training . One of them , in conversation on KAN Reshet Bet with Liat Regev , told her that he had not been called up , and did not know why , and he knew of other haredi young men who had voluntarily enlisted , spent a year in training , and were still sitting at home , waiting for a call-up.What is the point of this if the defense establishment doesn&rsquo;t want to have haredim on the battlefield ? If it does want them , why not call them up when they&rsquo;re willing to fight and put their lives on the line?Haredim who sign up display special courage , because there is so much pressure on them from their families and their communities not to do so . ■ ON ANOTHER , more personal issue , Piron is as pleased as punch . His daughter Or Piron Zomer campaigned to head the Oranit Council & ndash ; and triumphed . She is one of the very few female council heads in Israel . ■ MOST OF the many International Women&rsquo;s Day events are simply a means of acknowledging the success of women achievers in a variety of professions and entrepreneurial activities & ndash ; both social and business.Factory 54 , which specializes in high-class fashion and carries merchandise with the labels of the world&rsquo;s best-known designers , went one better on Tuesday , in that the event that it hosted at its store in the Ramat Aviv Mall was for the benefit of the next generation.Held in conjunction with , and on behalf of , Babies for Life , an organization that rescues and adopts hungry infants during the first year of their lives , and helps single mothers and families suffering from economic distress , the event featured noted broadcaster Dana Weiss and veteran singer Rita talking about everything and anything . The two celebs represent women&rsquo;s voices , and among the subjects they discussed was woman&rsquo;s voice during the present war.The occasion also gave people who like to mingle with celebs the opportunity to do so . There were quite a few celebs on hand , in addition to the two who were conducting the conversation.Exchanging views on implications of genocide case ■ ISRAEL&rsquo;S IMMEDIATE past attorney-general , Mandelblit , is currently in New York with Amit Becher , the president of the Israel Bar Association , to join UJA lawyers in a panel discussion in which they will exchange views on implications of the genocide accusations against Israel at the International Court of Justice and the future of judicial reform in Israel . The big question is whether the outcome in either case will affect Israel&rsquo;s diplomatic status.Embassies celebrate independence day amid war&nbsp ; ■ BEARING IN mind the security situation , some embassies have canceled their traditional Independence Day receptions , while others have thought up different ways in which to celebrate.The Hungarian Embassy , for instance , will celebrate the anniversary of the 1848-49 Hungarian Revolution and War of Independence with an online screening of Gabor Herendi&rsquo;s blockbuster movie Kincsem ( My Precious ) , which was the name of the famous Hungarian thoroughbred racehorse with the longest undefeated record in history , winning all of her 54 races . The movie is a period drama love story set in 19th-century Hungary.The link to the film and the required password can be acquired from the Hungarian Embassy at the email address rsvp.tlv@mfa.gov.hu / . Registration by March 13 is essential . The link and password will be sent to the email address that would-be viewers have indicated , just before the start of the screening , which is scheduled for 5 p.m . on Thursday , March 14 . When registering please state how many viewers there will be.Following the screening the movie will be available for an additional 24 hours to people who had other commitments on the above mentioned date to see it.Estonia sets the trend ■ IT WAS published recently in this column that the Estonian Embassy wanted to celebrate its Independence Day with both fun and good deeds . Estonian Ambassador Veikko Kala may have started a trend among some of his colleagues . The idea was that all the guests would congregate at the Cooking Studio in Tel Aviv , and under the supervision of professional chefs would prepare kosher meals for evacuees , thereby adding to Israel&rsquo;s national resilience.Many of the invitees loved the idea , and some 120 showed up & ndash ; approximately half of them diplomats and half Israelis , as well as friends who were neither diplomats nor Israelis . Altogether , there were more than the embassy expected.Each participant received the gift of an Estonian apron with the embassy logo and the slogan & ldquo;Estonia cooks with you . & rdquo;During approximately one and a half hours , they prepared salmon , beef stew , roast chicken , beef patties , and tofu , served with rice , potatoes , and green beans . Anyone hoping for a taste of Estonian cuisine was disappointed , but it was such a fun evening that no one minded the Israeli fare that was served afterward with wine.Guests who had minimal kitchen experience quickly learned to chop , slice , cook , and pack.Generally , when one talks of stirring the pot , it means causing tension , but in this case Gil Haskel , chief of State Protocol , was literally stirring the pot as he shared a work counter with Croatian Ambassador Vesela Korac and the deputy heads of mission of Portugal and Italy.Some 300 meals were prepared , and because the date coincided with the second anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine , recipients included Israeli evacuees and Ukrainian refugees who are being sheltered in Israel for the duration of the war in their homeland.An extra bonus for the guests was that many were working side by side with people they had not previously known , and were thus able to make new friends with ease.After all their work , they were rewarded with a mouthwatering supper washed down with excellent wine.greerfc@gmail.com","grapevine , march 6 , 2024 : arrivederci roma"
2021-08-07 05:11:07.347,jpost,"Two separate incidents that took place in the West Bank over the past few days underlined the discrepancy between the Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s rhetoric in public and its actions on the ground . & ldquo;The Palestinian Authority is a real Jekyll and Hyde , & rdquo ; a Ramallah-based Western diplomat remarked this week with reference to the inconsistency . & ldquo;The Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s rhetoric towards Israel is bad , but its actions on the ground , especially the security coordination with the Israeli security authorities , are good . & rdquo ; The diplomat&rsquo;s remark is shared by many Palestinians who are familiar with the inner workings of the PA . In the first incident , two Israeli women in their 40s were spotted by Palestinians late at night driving their car alone inside al-Ama&rsquo;ri refugee camp at the entrance to Ramallah and its twin city , El-Bireh . The camp is considered a stronghold of Palestinian militants belonging to various groups , including those opposed to PA President Mahmoud Abbas and his ruling Fatah faction . The PA security forces are often reluctant to enter al-Ama&rsquo;ri to avoid friction with the groups . In this case , however , as soon as the PA security forces were informed about the presence of the Israeli women in the camp , they rushed to the scene and safely escorted them out and handed them over to the IDF . The second incident took place in the PA-controlled part of Hebron , a city traditionally known as a stronghold of Islamist groups , particularly Hamas and Hizb ut-Tahrir ( Party of Liberation ) . A bus carrying IDF soldiers that accidentally entered Hebron was safely escorted by PA security forces out of the city . No one was hurt and minimal damage was caused to the bus as a result of rock-throwing by a small number of Palestinians . The two incidents could have ended in a tragic way , were it not for the intervention of the PA security forces . Had any of the women or soldiers been harmed , this would have resulted in a serious deterioration in the security situation on the ground and renewed tensions between the new Israeli government headed by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and the PA . Such an escalation would also have dealt a severe blow to the Biden administration&rsquo;s efforts to rebuild confidence between Israel and the Palestinians with the hope of reviving the stalled peace process . The Biden administration has endorsed a policy that seeks to bolster the standing of the PA as a way of countering the rising popularity of Hamas . The Americans want the Israeli government to follow suit by engaging with PA officials and refraining from unilateral moves , including the eviction of Arab families from their homes in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah . Indeed , Bennett&rsquo;s government and the PA leadership appear to be moving toward some form of rapprochement . In addition to the continuing security coordination , Israeli and PA ministers recently met for the first time in several years . Moreover , the government has agreed to increase the number of permits for Palestinians who wish to work in Israel , and , according to Palestinian sources , senior PA officials whose VIP cards were confiscated by the previous government of Benjamin Netanyahu have gotten them back . Some Palestinians maintain that the security coordination between the PA security forces and the IDF never stopped , not even when Abbas and other Palestinian institutions claimed that they had suspended all ties with Israel , including in the security field . The incidents in Ramallah and Hebron were not the first of their kind . Several cases involving Israeli ( Jewish ) citizens who were seen by the Palestinians inside Area A of the West Bank have been returned safely to Israel , thanks to the efforts of the PA security forces . Entry into this area , which is controlled exclusively by the PA , is forbidden to all Israeli citizens . Israel , however , does not stop Arab-Israelis from entering Area A . Most of the cases involving Israelis caught in Area A are not publicized , probably in order to avoid embarrassing the PA . Each time Palestinians learn that the PA security forces & ldquo;rescued&rdquo ; Israeli citizens caught in Area A , they accuse the Palestinian leadership of & ldquo;collaboration&rdquo ; and serving as & ldquo;subcontractors&rdquo ; for the Israeli security establishment . But the security coordination is not a one-way relationship benefiting Israel alone . Abbas was quoted a few years ago as telling a group of Israelis who visited him at the Mukata presidential compound in Ramallah that security coordination [ with Israel ] is & ldquo;sacred . & rdquo ; Although Abbas did not elaborate , it&rsquo;s obvious that the Palestinians , too , enjoy the fruits of this coordination . First , the PA and Israel have a common enemy in the West Bank & ndash ; Hamas . Abbas is well aware that without Israel&rsquo;s security presence in the West Bank , Hamas and another Iranian-backed proxy , Palestinian Islamic Jihad , would pose a direct threat to the PA . Second , the security coordination ensures the continued flow of funds to the PA from the Americans , Europeans and other international parties . In a bid to further curry favor with the Western donors , including the Biden administration , Abbas and senior PA officials have recently indicated their readiness to return to the negotiating table with Israel under the auspices of the Quartet members & ndash ; US , European Union , United Nations , and Russia . PA officials who are talking about their dissatisfaction with the Bennett government are actually sending a message to the Biden administration that it needs to get more involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . YET WHILE Palestinian security officers are & ldquo;rescuing&rdquo ; Israelis who accidentally enter Area A , and as the security coordination appears to be continuing in full force and effect , the rhetoric of the PA and Fatah toward Israel remains as toxic as ever . This is precisely why many Palestinians and Israelis are confused about the real intentions of the PA leadership . On the one hand , the PA is telling Palestinians that it wants to prosecute Israelis for & ldquo;war crimes&rdquo ; and & ldquo;ethnic cleansing&rdquo ; before international forums , including the International Criminal Court . The PA is also telling Palestinians that there is no difference between the Bennett government and the Netanyahu government , especially regarding the policy of settlement construction and the & ldquo;Judaization&rdquo ; of Jerusalem . On the other hand , this is the same PA that is allowing its ministers and security officials to hold meetings with their Israeli counterparts . Similarly , many in Israel still cannot figure out whether the PA is an ally or an enemy . The PA&rsquo;s deeds and rhetoric suggest that it is both an ally and an enemy . It is an ally when it comes to working with the IDF in maintaining security and stability in the West Bank . It is an enemy when it comes to the fiery rhetoric of PA officials and media outlets . & ldquo;The Palestinian Authority has always excelled in sending conflicting messages to both the Palestinians and the Israelis , & rdquo ; remarked a veteran Palestinian journalist from Ramallah . & ldquo;The Palestinians have long become used to the duplicity of the Palestinian leadership . & rdquo ; The PA&rsquo;s actions on the ground may be good for Israel in the short term . These actions place the PA on the side of the good guys in the war on terrorism . In the long run , however , the anti-Israel rhetoric emerging from Ramallah is further radicalizing Palestinians . The PA , in other words , is driving more Palestinians into the welcoming arms of its own rivals , Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad . The apparent rapprochement between the PA and the Israeli government and the Biden administration&rsquo;s policy of & ldquo;strengthening&rdquo ; the PA are critical for the continued survival of Abbas and his cohorts . But this approach comes with a cost . The closer Abbas moves toward Israel and the US , the more he loses points with the Palestinian street . The Bennett government and the Biden administration may help the 85-year-old Abbas hold on to power , but there&rsquo;s nothing the Israelis and Americans can do to help him regain the confidence of his people . Abbas&rsquo;s decision to cancel the parliamentary election , which was supposed to take place on May 22 , and the recent unprecedented massive security crackdown on Palestinian political activists , journalists and social media users have severely undermined the credibility of the PA leadership . At this stage , it&rsquo;s clear that the widespread discontent with the Ramallah-based leadership does not pose an imminent threat to the PA . The PA security forces remain loyal to Abbas , and the number of people willing to take to the streets to demand & ldquo;regime change&rdquo ; is declining every week . If and when the peace talks with Israel resume , Abbas is sure to face a radical reaction from the Palestinians . Under the current circumstances , the likelihood of marketing any agreement with Israel to the Palestinian public is zero . This statistical nonstarter is the direct result of the PA&rsquo;s decades-long demonization of Israel , which remains one of the major obstacles to moving forward with any peace process .",why is pa rhetoric so anti-israel when there is good cooperation ?
2023-11-03 11:40:16.200,jpost,"Just over a year ago , Stav Levi met Idan Shtivi , 28 , while she was working for a brief period at Ijo & amp ; Babet , a wine bar on Tel Aviv&rsquo;s Dizengoff Street . The chance meeting , a growing rarity in the age of online dating , sparked a deep love that has grown over a relatively short time . & nbsp ; & ldquo;One of the things that defines Idan is his heart . There aren&rsquo;t so many people who you can say are truly pure in their core . He is quiet , but so profound and strong , & rdquo ; Levi says , smiling wanly , if only for an instant , as she enters the fourth week without him as her rock and partner . Idan is still missing , presumed to be held captive in the Gaza Strip as the deadly war that has consumed Levi&rsquo;s life wages on.Together , they camped and hiked throughout Israel , sharing a mutual love for nature and the environment & ndash ; a defining passion that led Idan to pursue a career in environmental sciences at Reichman University&rsquo;s School of Sustainability , where he began his second year recently . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Idan is driven to make an impact in the world , with a desire to promote green energy and environmental conservation . He has this connection to the earth , & rdquo ; explains his older brother , Omri , 30 , gazing across the crystal blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea from his mother&rsquo;s apartment in Tel Aviv . & nbsp;Idan lives for the water , and was about to sign a new lease with Levi on October 9 in the seaside community of Ein Hayam . The natural and free-flowing nature of the water mirrors Idan&rsquo;s outlook on life , sharing a passion for free-diving and extreme sports with his brother . & nbsp ; & ldquo;He and his friends were together on a boat in the middle of the sea , and Idan dove into the water , & rdquo ; Omri recounts . & ldquo;A minute passed , then two minutes , and his friends started to worry . After three minutes , Idan resurfaced , catching a huge fish and [ sporting ] a big smile . He is the kind of person who will always surprise you . He&rsquo;s a survivor , and this is what helps us to believe . & rdquo ; Maintaining his composure , Omri holds on to the belief that his brother&rsquo;s survival instincts will soon return him to his family . & nbsp;To his family and many friends , Idan is the anchor that imparts a sense of confidence , a reassuring presence to everyone around him that everything will always be okay . Idan&rsquo;s family holds on to that feeling , trusting that Idan will persevere against all odds and return to them . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Growing up , Idan always made me feel secure , and I could always depend on him for everything . Whenever I am struggling , he is always there beside me , & rdquo ; says his sister , Hila , 24 , detailing to the extent that Idan would stay with her at night when she was scared or had trouble sleeping , until she would fall asleep . & ldquo;He&rsquo;s this person who makes you feel that you can do anything . Anything that needs to be done , fixed , taken care of , that&rsquo;s Idan . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Idan was asked to photograph at Supernova music festivalAN AMATEUR photographer , Idan was asked at the last minute by friends to take pictures during the yoga and music workshops they were leading the next morning at the Supernova music festival near Kibbutz Re&rsquo;im in the western Negev . Idan made sure to join his family for Shabbat dinner on October 6 before waking up at 5 a.m . to drive down to help capture the beauty of the peaceful gathering in the warm glow of the desert sun . This was the last time his family saw him before the celebration of music and nature would become the epicenter of the most tragic event of their lives . & ldquo;Idan had only just arrived [ at the festival ] when I called him at 6:48 a.m . and he told me that rockets had started to go off . It was just the rockets at this point . It was only a matter of minutes before gunshots were fired , & rdquo ; Levi recalls as she sits at Idan&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s kitchen table with Omri and Hila , recounting the haunting events that they continue to replay in their heads . & nbsp;Idan&rsquo;s survival instincts quickly kicked in , calmly explaining to his girlfriend that they were packing up and getting ready to head home with the two friends he had traveled with . Just as they were about to leave , Idan saw another friend who was wounded and took responsibility to drive his car , along with another girl , making sure to help everyone escape safely . & ldquo;They were one of the first cars to get out before anyone understood the extent of the real situation , at around 7:15 , & rdquo ; Omri elaborates , detailing every aspect of his brother&rsquo;s attempted escape . & ldquo;They had made it onto the main road before seeing it had been blocked by Hamas terrorists in stolen police cars . He crossed over into the southbound lane , and only made it approximately 4 km . before it appeared that Hamas opened fire somewhere near the junction at Kissufim . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Without any photographic evidence , witness accounts , or Israeli intelligence to confirm if Idan is alive , Omri , Hila , and Levi face an ongoing nightmare that grows with each passing day . Desperate for answers , and plagued by uncertainty , Omri had to piece together the events that unfolded himself , tracking his brother&rsquo;s location from his phone , looking through photographs of the carnage that took place , and eventually traveling himself to Idan&rsquo;s last known location after a week without any information on his brother&rsquo;s whereabouts . & nbsp ; & ldquo;It was absolute hell , and just to see it was traumatic , & rdquo ; he recalls . & ldquo;Burnt cars filled with bullet holes , the festival site was destroyed&hellip ; I was there for hours [ searching ] , but I quickly understood that the area was enormous ; it would take thousands of people to search . & rdquo ; & nbsp;The car that Idan had driven was bloodstained and filled with bullet holes , near a tree off the side of the road , leading Omri to understand that the terrorists continued to shoot at Idan and the two friends he had helped escape , before being forced to veer off the road . The bodies of the other two passengers with Idan were found , but there is still no evidence to conclude that Idan was among those slain in the massacre . & nbsp ; & ldquo;As our options [ for Idan&rsquo;s fate ] continue to narrow , we assume , or maybe just hope , that he was abducted , but there is no official news , & rdquo ; Hila surmises , clinging to the belief that her brother is among the 240 hostages who are being held in Gaza.Faced with the unimaginable trial of making it through each day , Omri , Hila and Levi continue to investigate , communicate with Israeli intelligence agencies , and reach out to other witnesses , hoping to glean a shred of evidence to confirm that Idan is still alive . Holding steadfast to their belief in Idan&rsquo;s survival instincts , his family continues to persevere against the bleak alternative.For Idan&rsquo;s family , this heinous act of terror transcends classification as a war crime & ndash ; it is a crime against the morality of mankind . Quickly taking a more assertive tone , Levi clarifies the sentiments of the hundreds of families who have been torn apart by Hamas . & ldquo;The global community needs to [ step in ] . We don&rsquo;t know who has been taken hostage , & rdquo ; she says . & ldquo;There are more than 100 families like us who don&rsquo;t even know , don&rsquo;t have any answers . We can&rsquo;t tolerate this for even another minute . & ldquo;The first thing that needs to happen is to bring in the Red Cross , & rdquo ; she stresses . & ldquo;What is the status of the hostages & ndash ; who they are , who is alive and who is dead & ndash ; and , most importantly , to bring them home ! & rdquo ; ","israeli hostages in gaza : idan shtivi , a reassuring presence to everyone around him"

2024-04-19 13:21:59.240,jpost,"The outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and the horrors of October 7 sent Israel Elwyn&rsquo;s early intervention centers into chaos , said the director of Elwyn&rsquo;s Haifa and Northern Israel Branch , Keren Strul . & ldquo;Like the rest of the country , we were caught unaware , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;There were hardly any [ early intervention ] frameworks in which the war did not have a personal impact on each of the families . & rdquo;Proving services to thousands of people in Israel with disabilitiesElwyn Israel provides services to over 5,400 people in Israel with disabilities , and its early intervention centers provide rehabilitation and treatment to children from six months to three years old.The centers treat kids with developmental delays and autism , and research shows that this early intervention can have a significant impact on their progression , the organization explained.Elwyn&rsquo;s goal , and one of the goals of the intervention centers , is to provide people with tools to promote their independence and involvement in the community , and they work based on the belief that everyone deserves to be included in society.The children treated at these centers go through a daily schedule that is very similar to what children their age experience in other frameworks , but in addition to their preschool day , they receive a wide variety of treatment , including occupational , speech , and physical therapy.From the outbreak of the war , it took around two weeks until Elwyn was able to overcome the chaos of the beginning and to get organized , said Strul . & ldquo;My organization knows how to quickly get on board and offer services in an emergency , in the war , as it did in the corona pandemic , & rdquo ; she explained . & ldquo;We were one of the first organizations to provide services&rdquo ; after the war&rsquo;s outbreak , she said.Strul noted how important her organization&rsquo;s ability to work independently was , because it meant that Elwyn did not have to & ldquo;wait for the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry or the Home Front Command , who first needed to handle things that were bigger than intervention centers . & rdquo;Her work was very emotional , helping parents handling impossible situations , as she coped with the war herself , Strul shared . & ldquo;An experience that touched me personally was the story of one of the mothers from the North , & rdquo ; Strul shared . The mother & ldquo;was evacuated and had just received a diagnosis that her child is autistic . Before she came to us , she didn&rsquo;t know what to do , & rdquo ; Strul said , explaining that the mother was forced to leave her home right after receiving her child&rsquo;s diagnosis and had no idea what framework was appropriate for , or accessible to , her child during the war.To make matters more complicated , this mother&rsquo;s husband was called to reserve duty and was unreachable in Gaza . She then she found out she was pregnant with her second child . & ldquo;You have to understand that the evacuees have a very difficult experience because they have been uprooted from their homes , & rdquo ; said Strul , explaining that things are especially hard when you & ldquo;uproot a child with a disability from their home . & rdquo;Strul shared that she marveled at the difficulty of the situation , asking herself how she could help someone handling so much chaos . & ldquo;She [ the mother ] really fell apart , & rdquo ; described Strul.Along with her team , Strul helped the mother to find an appropriate framework , and providing this help gave Strul the chance to take action , which , in turn , helped her handle her own experience . It & ldquo;made me sharper and kept me from sinking in the sadness and terrible grief we are all dealing with , & rdquo ; she explained.Personally helping this woman & ldquo;took me to a place of & lsquo;okay , I have a job to do , and I need to lead the team and help the families , and have some routine , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; she said , adding that this story made her stronger.ANOTHER ELEMENT that made things emotionally difficult for many employees and intervention center families was the mixed Arab-Jewish nature of many of Elwyn&rsquo;s teams , said Strul.This proximity at work & ldquo;brought up the conflict that exists in the country , & rdquo ; she said . It was hard to avoid sensitive topics , at a time when tensions and emotions were so high.There were & ldquo;parents whose children were in preschools with Arab staff , & rdquo ; which brought up fears for some of them , described Strul , adding that & ldquo;this also impacted Arab employees who encountered Jewish parents who were uncomfortable with them . & rdquo;Strul handled these feelings with open communication . & ldquo;You have to give these feelings space , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;If you pretend these feelings don&rsquo;t exist , they will come out in the end . So , first of all , we decided that we were going to give them space and talk about them on a local level . & ldquo;If we saw that there were problems or conflicts , feelings that sometimes aren&rsquo;t apparent on the surface but are under the surface , we addressed them , & rdquo ; she said.IN ADDITION to the emotional turmoil of helping the families from their centers , Elwyn&rsquo;s staff had to contend with numerous logistical hurdles.Some of the centers did not have appropriate shelters and needed to be totally relocated to spaces with adequate protection . Some centers were too close to conflict zones , and needed to be totally evacuated.The organization offered a variety of solutions , depending on the stage of the war and the unique needs it presented . & ldquo;We offered services from afar , using videos . An occupational therapist would show parents how to help with their child&rsquo;s treatment at home , & rdquo ; said Strul , who added that the organization recruited numerous volunteers to help provide these services.The organization also prepped the center&rsquo;s shelters and drilled taking the children into the shelter in the appropriate time frame . Elwyn staff created special activities for the children to do while they were in shelters , to try to make the time pass more calmly.Caring for these families in the chaos of the war was an incredible challenge , but no less of a challenge was the job of caring for the early intervention center staff , Strul explained . & ldquo;The son of one of our workers was murdered at the [ Super]nova music festival , & rdquo ; Strul recounted . & ldquo;It was a shock , encountering that on a personal level , when one of your workers loses her 21-year-old son . She was totally broken , & rdquo ; said Strul , who added that handling this loss of someone who is a daily part of her life caused her to break down as well . & ldquo;We accompanied her for the whole shiva [ mourning period ] and we were with her and came to visit her , & rdquo ; Strul said , adding that they also provided space for the staff to process the loss together.Many of Strul&rsquo;s staff were also evacuated from their homes in the North . & ldquo;There was a lot of thought put into what happens with those workers , how can we help them so they will come back to a sort of schedule , & rdquo ; Strul explained . & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there was a single worker who did not get the care they needed , & rdquo ; she said.Looking forward , Strul feels prepared to handle whatever the continuation of the war , or possible escalation in the north , might throw their way.There is a feeling that the war is present . & ldquo;There could be a siren today , & rdquo ; said Strul , & ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t occupy us daily . & rdquo ; & ldquo;What is important is that , in an emergency , the staff knows what to do with each child , where to take them , where the safe area is for each structure , who the Home Front Command contact is , what is in the shelter , what equipment , & rdquo ; she explained.Unexpected events will always be present , but Strul isn&rsquo;t worried . When asked why , her answer is simple : & ldquo;Because we are prepared for it . & rdquo ;",child disability organization faces challenges during the war

In addition , the institute&rsquo;s biannual international conference brings together leading academics , professionals , and investors from around the world to create scientific partnerships and develop breakthrough discoveries.Headed by Prof . David Mendlovic , the Zimin Institute at TAU is among the pioneering & ldquo;Zimin Institutes for a Better World , & rdquo ; established by the Zimin Foundation . Driven by the vision of the late Dr . Dimitri Zimin , an engineer , entrepreneur , and philanthropist , these institutes aim to integrate engineering research with medical and healthcare technologies , aligning seamlessly with TAU&rsquo;s multidisciplinary ethos . The institute takes pride in funding numerous groundbreaking studies , many of which are already making tangible impacts in the healthcare industry , thus realizing Dr . Zimin&rsquo;s vision of fostering positive change.A recent success story involves Zimin&rsquo;s investment in early detection technology for fetal malformations and developmental disorders . Building on groundbreaking research in fetal electrocardiograms ( FECGs ) at TAU , this investment has yielded promising results . FECG , the prevailing method for detecting developmental differences and fetal distress , is currently limited by its reliance on invasive techniques or noisy maternal signals . In a breakthrough study , researchers Dr . Dan Raviv and Dr . Shai Tejman-Yarden propose a novel approach to extract FECGs from joint maternal-fetal data using deep learning models . Their method , personalized and self-supervised for each patient , demonstrates real-time extraction of high-quality maternal and fetal ECGs , offering a significant advancement in fetal monitoring accuracy.In the study , researchers Dr . Dan Raviv from the School of Electrical Engineering at TAU and Dr . Shai Tejman-Yarden from Sheba Hospital propose a new approach to extracting the FECG from the joint maternal-fetal data , which comes attached to the common ECG sample from at least two sources . They then train a Deep Learning model to separate the two in real-time . Because this is a difficult task , the researchers created a personalized and self-supervised network for patients . This method trains individually on the data of each patient ( mother and fetus ) and can extract the maternal and fetal ECG in real-time and with high quality . Based on preliminary results using real-world data , the researchers demonstrate that the hypothesis and solution are applicable and feasible.Another medical project funded by the Zimin Institute that is already in its advanced stages is the TENG ( Triboelectric nanogenerator ) sensor , which can restore the sense of touch to people who have lost this sense due to injury , illness , chemotherapy , and more . The sensor is durable , small , and modular and operates using an independent energy source to restore tactile sensitivity without the need for an external energy source , and can be easily and safely implanted under the skin in a variety of places . Today there are millions of people in the world who have lost their sense of touch , and there is currently no approved clinical solution capable of restoring their sensation . Through the unique support that the Zimin Institute offered to the team of researchers , led by Prof . Ben Maoz from the Department of Biomedical Engineering at TAU , a start-up company called Teng-Able was established , and their sensor is currently in the clinical trials phase . & nbsp ;",the zimin institute at tau : promoting scientific solutions for humankind’s challenges

2024-06-08 00:32:23.407,jpost,"The French movie The Sixth Child , which opened in Israeli theaters on Thursday , brings to mind the famous line from Jean Renoir&rsquo;s The Rules of the Game : & ldquo;The awful thing about life is this : everyone has their reasons . & rdquo;The Sixth Child , directed by Leopold Legrand , is an intricately constructed tragedy about two couples who choose to make an awful but understandable decision , and they all have their reasons . What&rsquo;s brilliant about it is that , as heartrending as this story is , there are no obvious villains & ndash ; other than a heartless economy and an unfeeling adoption bureaucracy & ndash ; and no easy answers.As I watched the movie , my loyalties kept shifting among the characters , and I wasn&rsquo;t always sure where it was going & ndash ; one of the highest compliments I can give any movie.What is The Sixth Child about?The movie starts out showing the tough lives of Franck ( Damien Bonnard , who can currently be seen in Poor Things ) and Meriem ( Judith Chemla , who starred in the Israeli film The End of Love ) , a Roma couple struggling to make ends meet as they raise five children in a trailer park , which they have chosen because it is near good schools.Franck is a scrap metal dealer , and when his partner picks a fight , he , too , gets in trouble with the law . Julien ( Benjamin Lavernhe , who recently appeared in Jeanne du Barry and who was also in The Sense of Wonder ) , the lawyer Meriem hires to get him out of the jam , is understanding and makes a payment plan . To thank him , Franck insists that Julien and his wife , Anna ( Sara Giraudeau , one of the stars of The Bureau ) , who is also a lawyer , stop by for a beer.Anna isn&rsquo;t interested at first but then is charmed by their children , and it turns out that she can&rsquo;t have any of her own . They have tried IVF several times and it failed , and psychologists have given her damning reports when they have tried to adopt , essentially saying she wants a baby too badly.A little while later , when Franck comes to Julien&rsquo;s office unannounced , Julien thinks it is because he needs more help with his case . But it&rsquo;s not that : Meriem is pregnant with what will be their sixth child . They are devout Catholics and an abortion is out of the question , but they are already packed like sardines into their trailer . Franck desperately needs money for a new van to replace the one that was damaged in an accident ; without it , he can&rsquo;t support the family . So he proposes an unholy deal : their baby in exchange for money to buy a new van.Julien quickly shuts him down : This would be human trafficking and highly illegal . But when he tells Anna about the incident , she is desperate to go for it . They float the idea of a legal deal : an open adoption , where they would raise the child , but Franck and Meriem would still be the parents and would be in the child&rsquo;s life . But Meriem can&rsquo;t bear this idea . She would much prefer to give the baby to this couple and walk away.At this point , Julien is desperate to shut down the whole idea because he knows that to pay the couple for their baby would be wrong , legally and morally . But Anna can&rsquo;t let go of this dream of raising this baby , and Meriem and Franck have decided they will give the baby up for adoption in any case , since they are in such dire financial straits . Anna&rsquo;s determination over this baby drives a wedge between her and her husband . Meanwhile , Meriem is despondent about the idea of giving up this baby but know she cannot give another child a good life.THE STORY plays out like a Greek tragedy , in which each character follows his own destiny , no matter how much sorrow it will bring . You wish for a happy ending for all of them , knowing it isn&rsquo;t possible.At first I thought that the two lawyers would be portrayed as vile , predatory rich people , but the movie goes in a different direction . They are portrayed as deserving of compassion because of their infertility , and if the film is anyone&rsquo;s story , it&rsquo;s Anna&rsquo;s.While it&rsquo;s clear that capitalism and anti-Roma racism have put Franck and Meriem into an impossible situation , they have a warm , loving family , which Anna and Julien don&rsquo;t have . There is no explanation given for the fact that they can&rsquo;t have children , but it is devastating for Anna and , to a lesser extent , for Julien.The four actors work well together , and all give good performances , but the standout is Giraudeau as Anna . It is she who drives the action and can&rsquo;t give up , willing to sacrifice her upper-class life to become a mother.There have been many movies about parents who fight over children , such as several films based on the Baby M and similar cases , and many fall into clich&eacute;s.The Sixth Child avoids these pitfalls , although toward the end , some of the resolutions feel too neat . But it&rsquo;s still a movie where you identify with everyone . You keep turning over their options in your mind , and will likely think about the characters and the story long after the movie ends .","' the sixth child ' : a tragic french story of parenthood , poverty - review"

2021-08-14 16:28:11.070,jpost,"Egypt , Qatar , the United Nations and other international parties are making significant efforts to prevent&nbsp;another military confrontation&nbsp;between Israel and the Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip . On Friday , Israel announced for the first time in 18 months that it will allow merchants and businessmen from the Gaza Strip to enter through the Erez crossing . The announcement came after the relative calm on the Gaza-Israel border during which no balloons or incendiary devices were launched toward Israel . Hamas sources said that the mediation efforts were being made due to Israel&rsquo;s insistence on linking reconstruction of the Gaza Strip to a prisoner exchange . Hamas has been holding the bodies of IDF soldiers Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin since 2014 , and is holding Israeli citizens Avner Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed , who entered the Gaza Strip on their own in 2014 and 2015 respectively . The sources told the Palestinian daily Al-Quds that mediators from Egypt , Qatar , the UN and the European Union are working to avoid another flare-up of hostilities between the Gaza-based factions and Israel . Several factions warned over the weekend that failure to move forward with reconstruction would lead to another military confrontation with Israel . According to the sources , the factions met in recent days and discussed setting an ultimatum to Israel in the event that there is no breakthrough in the reconstruction issue , as well as the easing of restrictions imposed on the Gaza Strip . & ldquo;The coming days will be decisive in this regard , and the resistance factions will not accept anything less than the fulfillment of their demands , & rdquo ; the sources said . & ldquo;The mediators asked Hamas and the other factions to give them more time to achieve a breakthrough on these issues , including a possible prisoner exchange and a long-term truce with Israel . & rdquo ; In addition to merchants , all Gazan goods can now enter Israel for the first time since the end of May&rsquo;s 11-day Gaza war , the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories ( COGAT ) Maj . - Gen . Ghassan Alian announced . The list of items that can enter Gaza from Israel at Kerem Shalom&rsquo;s commercial crossing also expanded to include items used for transportation and communications . Equipment and goods for Gaza&rsquo;s humanitarian infrastructure , such as for the water and sewage systems , can also enter . Senior Hamas official&nbsp;Osama&nbsp;Hamdan&nbsp;said on Saturday that Egypt was continuing its efforts to prevent another military confrontation with Israel . Hamdan warned that the Gaza factions would not wait too long for a solution regarding the easing of the restrictions and the reconstruction of the houses destroyed during the 11-day war in May . The factions are also demanding a solution to the issue of the Qatari cash grants to the Strip . They accused the Palestinian Authority of hindering reconstruction and the delivery of the Qatari financial aid to more than 100,000 families . Earlier this month , a Palestinian official said that the PA and Qatar had reached an agreement on the transfer of the funds through the Palestinian Monetary Fund but Palestinian banks are refusing to cooperate for fear that they could be exposed to lawsuits on the grounds of supporting and funding terrorism . Azzam al-Ahmed , a senior member of the Fatah Central Committee , claimed that Israel , and not the PA , was responsible for the delay of the delivery of the Qatari funds , & ldquo;The Palestinian government signed an agreement in order to coordinate the disbursement of the funds in the Gaza Strip , which were previously transferred through the Israeli Mossad , & rdquo ; Ahmed said in a radio interview . He claimed that Israel rejected the agreement , & ldquo;because of its desire to take over the task of delivering the Qatari grant funds . & rdquo ; Contacts are underway between the Palestinian Authority , Qatar and Egypt to resolve the issue , Ahmed added . He denied charges that the PA was obstructing the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip . He stressed that reconstruction will only take place through the PA government headed by Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh . Ahmed said that there will be no reconstruction of the Gaza Strip until the split between the West Bank and Gaza Strip ends . & ldquo;There will be no reconstruction without achieving unity and ending the division , & rdquo ; he emphasized . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The head of the Palestinian General Federation of Trade Unions in the Gaza Strip , Sami al-Amsi , accused the PA of obstructing the transfer of the Qatari funds . He also accused the PA of imposing a siege and sanctions on the residents of the Gaza Strip . & ldquo;The Palestinian Authority is dragging its feet , because it wants to increase the pressure on people in the Gaza Strip and impose more sanctions on them , & rdquo ; Amsi said . & ldquo;The Palestinian Authority is punishing the sons of Fatah before Hamas . & rdquo ; Commenting on Israel&rsquo;s decision to allow the entry of Palestinian merchants and businessmen from the Gaza Strip into Israel , Amsi said the move came because of Israel&rsquo;s & ldquo;fear of the response of the Palestinian resistance factions . & rdquo ; Israel , he added , & ldquo;is an enemy that only understands the language of force . & rdquo ; Tovah Lazaroff contributed to this report .",mediators in bid to avert hamas-israel face-off

2024-03-24 11:25:22.430,jpost,"MK Meir Cohen from Yesh Atid , former welfare and social services minister , was interviewed recently by Anat Davidov and Udi Segal on 103FM radio about the war in Gaza , about the departure of New Hope chairman Gideon Sa'ar from the coalition with Benny Gantz Gantz , and on whether Yesh Atid would join the current coalition . He also criticized the conduct of the government and the Knesset by stating , "" There are debates here that you can't believe someone would raise during a war , "" and said of the families of the abductees , "" I see that it has become routine . "" Regarding the hostage deal taking shape , Cohen said that he "" sees the families , their story becomes routine . This is the great danger that we are in the overall picture of another thing called captives , and the world continues as usual . I sincerely hope that this will not happen , and we are doing everything we can to prevent it . "" When asked if he was afraid that the hostages would never be released , he answered , "" Yes . I don't know if the government will give them up , but the government's conduct and the lack of determination among some of the people I talk to lead us to the perception that there is not enough determination . Where there is not enough determination , that a state abandons 134 hostages&mdash;that's [ moral ] bankruptcy . "" He reveals that "" There is looting of the state budget . It's unbelievable that someone thinks that in the great distress we are in , they can pass such a budget .

Everything must be done to bring them back , and if we have to pay a heavy price , we should . "" Further into the interview , Cohen was asked if the prime minister and his government could afford to stall the return of the hostages . Cohen answered , "" I don't know . We are talking to them and making our voices heard . I hear determination from one side , even within the families of the hostages . We keep saying we won't end the efforts . Our people probably die in Gaza every week . "" The factors that influence Netanyahu's major political decisions&nbsp;Cohen also stated , "" I am realizing that Gantz and Eisenkot do not have a significant influence on the government , "" and said regarding Sa'ar , "" I think that what Gideon did was his decision but he should not have done it . It is his sole right to ask to be a cabinet member . What is worrying is that I think that the prime minister will accept him into the cabinet , but he will also bring Smotrich and Ben-Gvir along with him . "" Since we are witnessing the crazy circus , the lighting of bonfires in our districts by the security minister , I am very afraid of how the reduced cabinet will look .

2024-05-03 09:08:30.107,jpost,"It quickly became apparent to Ofir Amir , one of the founders and producers of the Supernova music festival , that survivors of the brutal Hamas attack , which left hundreds of festival goers dead or wounded , needed help.And so , Amir and other festival producers founded the nonprofit Tribe of Nova Foundation , in order to help survivors of the festival with their rehabilitation and return to life after the attack.The foundation also works to memorialize those who were killed at the party and to share their stories with the world.Nearly 380 festival participants and police were murdered on October 7 at the trance festival held in southern Israel near Kibbutz Re&rsquo;im . Countless participants were wounded , and some were taken hostage to Gaza.Shortly after the outbreak of the attack , which began with massive barrages of rockets from Gaza , police told the people at the festival to evacuate . Amir recalled staying a while after the evacuation order to make sure that party-goers were getting out safely.He described his hellish experience that morning , touching on the chaos caused by the Hamas attack , from which party-goers struggled to escape , as terrorists came at them from multiple directions and security forces were overrun.Around 8 a.m . , Amir saw emergency services bring a body into the festival site , and that is when the reality of the situation hit him , he said.After failing to escape in a car crammed with seven people , Amir lay in a field for hours , waiting for help . He was shot , hit in both of his legs . Some of the 20 people hiding near him kept coming to check on him , risking themselves each time.In that field , Amir&rsquo;s friend , who had also been shot , succumbed to his wounds . Amir was able to help him call his mother to say goodbye.One of the things that kept Amir going , surviving those long hours waiting for rescue , was thinking of his wife waiting for him at home , nine months pregnant . Amir&rsquo;s daughter was born four weeks later.Heroes on the production staffAmir shared stories of the heroism of other members of the festival&rsquo;s production staff.Just after the attack , one of the producers posted on social media , asking for those hiding around the party site to share their location with him so that emergency services and civilian rescuers could come and help them.He was inundated with thousands of messages , and was able to save more than 300 survivors of the party who were hiding in the area around the party , Amir shared . He came back every day for the rest of the week following the massacre , at first rescuing survivors , many of whom were wounded , and then locating bodies , said Amir.There are around 3,600 survivors , according to the foundation , which is still working to locate anyone who was at the party that day . The foundation is in touch daily with survivors and their families , in an attempt to help them with issues that the state does not provide enough support on . It also advocates for the families in various Knesset and government forums.BAR , WHO survived the attack , is active in the communities that the foundation offers to those who were at the festival . The 28-year-old Tel Aviv resident came to the event as a production assistant . She has been connected to trance music for years , and that is how she became involved in the Nova festivals , she said.A healing communityBar found the Nova healing communities soon after October 7 . & ldquo;A few days after the party , I got a message from one the producers , offering us to come to a campus set up for people who were at the party where they could be taken care of , & rdquo ; she remembered . & ldquo;It was during a time when I really didn&rsquo;t want to leave my house . I didn&rsquo;t want to leave my bed , & rdquo ; she said.She saw there was a concert at the campus and told a friend , who sent another friend who had been at the Supernova festival to bring Bar to the event . & ldquo;He literally pulled me out of bed so that we would go , & rdquo ; she remembered.At the campus , she found a setup that offered a break from how difficult things were , with performances , workshops , food , and drink for those who had been at the party . & ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have eaten anything if I wasn&rsquo;t there , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t able to prepare food for myself , and didn&rsquo;t want to eat anything , & rdquo ; she said , remembering how challenging the weeks following the party were . But at the campus , where there was food for the survivors and she was with her friends , she found herself able to eat.For months she came to the campus whenever she could , she said , explaining that she was not working , and was not capable of thinking about working at that time . & ldquo;The fact that I was able to leave my bed was an added bonus ; the fact that I was able to drive alone was an added bonus . The fact that I was outside my house after dark was a miracle , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;It was unbelievable that I was able to do those things . & rdquo;Various therapies on offerTHE VARIETY of treatments offered at the campus gave Bar the chance to find things that made her feel better . & ldquo;They gave us all the options of therapies and said , & lsquo;Come try them out , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; she remembered.The atmosphere at the campus was difficult in the days and weeks just after October 7 , but still made Bar feel much better . & ldquo;At first I saw friends that I hadn&rsquo;t seen since the party , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;We would cry and hug and couldn&rsquo;t believe we were there together . & rdquo;Bar talked about the benefits of the workshops offered at the campus . & ldquo;It takes you out of your thoughts . Something that holds me back a lot is thoughts , & rdquo ; she explained . & ldquo;What happened to me , how did this happen to me , to my friends ? & ndash ; All kinds of unpleasant thoughts that come with the post-traumatic reaction . & rdquo;When you do activities and workshops , you don&rsquo;t think of anything , she explained . & ldquo;You can disconnect for a minute and take this moment with your friends and music . & rdquo;Community and being surrounded by people who understand is also a major part of her process , Bar shared . & ldquo;Through conversations we have , I realize that we feel the same , & rdquo ; she said , explaining the comfort in the community of those who survived the festival . & ldquo;It makes the situation normal . You realized that it isn&rsquo;t only you , & rdquo ; she added . & ldquo;We understand each other . The community is really strong in that sense . . . . We are over 3,000 survivors . We understand that we are together in this , even if it is hard or bad . & rdquo;They encourage each other , reminding one another that a bad day will be followed by a better one.Bar expressed gratitude for the foundation&rsquo;s help with bureaucracy . & ldquo;They brought social workers and National Insurance Institute representatives , & rdquo ; making the institutions that could help her get what she is entitled to accessible , she said.Some authorities offered some benefits which the foundation helped survivors access , but generally Bar said that no authority took upon itself to take care of the survivors.The government was MIA , survivors say&ldquo;The Nova nonprofit has taken it on themselves to help us , and that is something no one else in the country did & ndash ; I&rsquo;m talking about government authorities .

2022-04-11 19:41:24.670,jpost,"For most Israelis , Amir Khoury , a Christian Arab , is a hero.Khoury is the policeman who gave chase earlier this month and helped stop & ndash ; at the cost of his life & ndash ; the terrorist in Bnei Brak before he could kill more than the four innocent civilians he had already slain in cold blood.The Bnei Brak Municipality announced on Sunday that a street in the haredi city would be named after Khoury . Khoury&rsquo;s father , Jeries , who also served in the police , reacted to the gesture by saying , & ldquo;We are seeing unity [ between Arabs and Jews ] that we have not seen for years . & rdquo;For Ayman Odeh , head of the Joint List , Khoury is a humiliation.Why ? Because he served in Israel&rsquo;s security forces.In a Ramadan greeting Odeh uploaded to Facebook from Jerusalem&rsquo;s Damascus Gate , where he said he hoped to one day see Palestinian flags flying , Odeh & ndash ; known to complain that the Israeli police do not do enough to stem crime in the Arab sector & ndash ; said all those serving in Israel&rsquo;s security forces should & ldquo;throw your guns in their faces and tell them our place is not with you . & rdquo;Odeh said he has met with groups of & ldquo;young Palestinians with Israeli citizenship&rdquo ; from & ldquo;occupied Arab Jerusalem&rdquo ; who have said they were being harmed and humiliated by the security forces . & ldquo;It is important for me to tell you from here , the Damascus Gate , that it is a humiliation for one of our sons to join the security forces , & rdquo ; he said.Odeh then called on a & ldquo;small minority&rdquo ; of Arabs who have enlisted & ndash ; he put the number at a few thousand & ndash ; to leave their jobs . He said they were & ldquo;humiliating our people , humiliating our families , and humiliating everyone who comes to pray in the blessed Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo;So Khoury , for Odeh , is a disgrace . And the historic unity that Khoury&rsquo;s father spoke about is , for Odeh and his Joint List , a political liability . This is a party that thrives on creating divisions and enmity between Jews and Arabs , not on fostering any kind of integration and unity.At a time of galloping terrorism , of citizens being shot and stabbed in city streets by fanatics whose terrorist methodology is used not only to kill Jews in Israel , but thousands upon thousands of Muslims around the world , Odeh&rsquo;s message is that those Arabs who are engaged in a battle against this indiscriminate murder are & ldquo;humiliating&rdquo ; their people.There are many messages Odeh could have delivered on the occasion of Ramadan . He could have gone for the traditional : & ldquo;May the crescent-shaped moon of Ramadan brighten your path toward enlightenment . & rdquo ; Or for the more spiritual , & ldquo;Ramadan is the month to seek forgiveness for our sins , may Allah accept our prayers and pardon our wrongdoings . & rdquo;He could have opted to spend his two-and-a-half-minute video talking about how the deprivation of the body during Ramadan is a time to concentrate on bettering the soul and on becoming a better person.Instead , what was the message of the leader of the largest Arab party in the Knesset ? That Arabs should not serve in the country&rsquo;s security forces & ndash ; security forces that also protect them.Odeh , who likes to fashion himself as an Israeli Palestinian Martin Luther King , had a message not of harmony but rather of division , of perpetual conflict & ndash ; anything but conciliation , anything but Arabs and Jews living side by side in this country , sharing the space equitably and shouldering part of the responsibility for keeping that space safe.While Ra&rsquo;am Party head Mansour Abbas , Odeh&rsquo;s political rival , is trying to improve the lot of the country&rsquo;s Arab minority by working with Israel and Israelis , Odeh continues to sow nothing but division and enmity.Religious Zionist Party MK Itamar Ben-Gvir has been rightly accused since the onset of this most recent wave of violence of & ldquo;dancing on the blood&rdquo ; of the victims , of going to the sites of some of the attacks and firing up the crowds , tapping into the rage caused by the terrorism to win new followers.Odeh is doing the same thing.The terrorism , and the IDF&rsquo;s response to it , are Odeh&rsquo;s cue to fan the flames.Sadly , that seems to be his only political ticket : what Odeh wants to do is make sure the Israeli-Arab conflict endures . He sees an opportunity to ensure that the discourse between Arab and Jew in this land is not one of integration , one of working within the system to get more for Arab-Israelis , issues that his rival Mansour Abbas speaks about ; rather , he wants the emphasis to be on the Aqsa Mosque and Palestinian nationalism.Odeh can&rsquo;t compete with Abbas on the integration card , on improving the daily lives of Arab-Israelis , so he needs to keep in the forefront the violence and the conflict and the & ldquo;occupation . & rdquo;The & ldquo;historic unity&rdquo ; that Jeries Khoury talked about is not the stuff that Odeh can cash in on at the ballot box . Odeh&rsquo;s political oxygen is only conflict and the & ldquo;evils of Zionism . & rdquo;This , he believes , is what resonates with his voters , and this is why he must forever put that at the forefront and look for reasons & ndash ; such as the recent wave of terrorism and the IDF&rsquo;s reaction & ndash ; to keep it there .",ayman odeh is toxic against israeli-arab unity - analysis

2023-07-03 20:14:08.270,jpost,"The outcome of the Jenin operation is unknown because no one knows how far the IDF is going to go , or how and when West Bank Palestinians and Israel&rsquo;s enemies , as well as its allies , will react.Some early data points gathered so far have compared it to Operation Defensive Shield in 2002 , however , and also to Operation Break the Wave , which started last March and hasn&rsquo;t stopped since.So far , the current operation is a far cry from Defensive Shield , when the IDF occupied large swaths of the West Bank for extended periods of time , with no particular end in mind , and explicitly kept open the possibility of a longer-term stay & ndash ; if it were needed to reduce terrorism.IDF's month-long operation in the West BankAll in all , the IDF left after about a month , although it did maintain cordons around specific villages and continued to go in and out of them in a volume and frequency far above anything it has done over the past year.That time was characterized by significant fighting that occurred simultaneously throughout the West Bank , with the IDF encircling and placing under siege then-Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat.More than 100 Israelis were killed , including dozens in one bombing alone , before the operation kicked into gear . Dozens of soldiers were killed during the operation , with more than 20,000 reservists called up . About 200 to 400 Palestinians were killed during the operation , with an additional 200 killed the month before . The number of wounded on both sides was high.So far , nothing on the Israeli or Palestinian side currently comes close to these numbers . Yet this operation is qualitatively different from the routine raids and arrests that the IDF , Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) , and Border Police have been conducting under Operation Break the Wave for more than a year.Although a dozen airstrikes did take place , airpower had not been used by the IDF in the West Bank & ndash ; unlike Gaza & ndash ; since 2006 . As well , a full brigade of soldiers has been mobilized & ndash ; as opposed to a small number of platoons or battalions . In terms of numbers , this is as many as thousands of soldiers in one case and a couple hundred in the other.IDF's operation signals a strategic shift with temporary gainsAnother point of difference is that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi have been personally following and managing the operation , minute to minute , instead of the middle management of lieutenant-colonels.The operation would not go on indefinitely , IDF Spokesman Brig . - Gen . Daniel Hagari said Monday , adding that several days was an option . For context , most operations over the last year lasted under an hour , or a few hours at most . This operation could extend for weeks or more if needed , Hagari said.In addition , IDF Home Front Command is now on high alert , both in the North and the South , concerned that the operation could instigate rocket fire . With all this , it is not even close to what has been happening over the last year , and it is a clear attempt to alter the strategic picture , using a grand show of force.Yet in terms of the ultimate result , it will likely yield only very temporary tactical achievements for Israel & ndash ; something akin to mowing the lawn , which then needs to be mowed again soon after.This is the situation because neither side is really ready for another Defensive Shield , with its high price in life . They also are not ready for a new diplomatic opening that could provide hope for the Palestinian side and douse the popularity of the terrorist groups.IDF's operation faces tactical limitations and generational resistance&nbsp;As of press time , there were no Israeli deaths as a result of the operation . This is not only due to talent and luck , but because the IDF is acting very slowly and very strategically in its gun battles . That cannot last if the IDF goes head-to-head with all the terrorist groups over an extended period of time.The IDF can confiscate hundreds of bombs and guns , but new ones can be made and bought within months . One group of terrorists can be killed or arrested , but another can easily replace them.Top IDF officials have repeatedly told The Jerusalem Post that one of the main reasons the IDF failed to clamp down on the terrorist wave this past year is that today&rsquo;s Palestinian teenagers and adolescents do not even remember Defensive Shield . They were born into a post-reality of it , and so they are not deterred from fighting the IDF . They have not met the might of an extended IDF operation.This one , without much more force or diplomacy , will not change that very fundamental fact .",will idf's war on jenin stop wave of terror against israelis ? - analysis

2021-09-09 21:00:01.087,jpost,"Sheikh Bilal Abu Hassan , a mosque preacher from Jenin , was surprised last week to receive a letter from the Palestinian Authority Ministry of Waqf and Religious Affairs informing him of the decision to fire him . Abu Hassan lost his job because of a khutbah ( sermon ) he recently delivered during Friday prayers at one of Jenin&rsquo;s mosques and in which he heaped praise on the Palestinian factions , including Hamas , in the Gaza Strip . Referring to the Israel-Hamas war last May , Abu Hassan applauded the & ldquo;Joint Operations Room , & rdquo ; which consists of various Palestinian factions that operate as a quasi-army against Israel . & ldquo;Our Joint Operations Room has unified the Palestinians , & rdquo ; he said from the minbar , a pulpit in a mosque where the imam ( leader of prayers ) stands to deliver sermons . & ldquo;This is the true meaning of Palestinian national unity . & rdquo ; The mosque preachers in the West Bank are appointed by the PA Ministry of Waqf and Religious Affairs . Every week , the ministry issues a directive to the imams concerning the Friday sermons . The directive includes instructions about the topics the imams should address during the sermons . Occasionally , the ministry also issues instructions regarding the topics that the imams are prohibited from addressing . Those who defy the instructions of the ministry are often punished by suspension or dismissal , as in the case of Abu Hassan . On Wednesday , as Palestinians were voicing support for the six Palestinian security prisoners who escaped from Gilboa Prison and protesting Israel&rsquo;s punitive measures against the inmates in various prisons , the PA Ministry of Waqf and Religious Affairs announced that the topic of Friday&rsquo;s sermon ( September 10 ) will be : & ldquo;High Morals in Islam . & rdquo ; The implicit message to the preachers : Ignore the fugitives who escaped from Israeli prison . The last thing the PA wants is for preachers who are on its payroll to stand in a mosque and praise , in front of thousands of worshipers , members of Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) . ( Five of the men who escaped are members of the Iranian-backed terrorist group ) . The jailbreak is seen by many Palestinians as an embarrassment not only for Israel , but for the PA too . The escape came at a time when relations between Israel and the PA appeared to be improving , especially after the recent meeting in Ramallah between PA President Mahmoud Abbas and Defense Minister Benny Gantz . Now , the PA and its senior officials and spokesmen are being forced to publicly endorse the PIJ fugitives as & ldquo;heroes&rdquo ; and issue strong condemnations against Israel because of the ensuing crackdown on hundreds of PIJ inmates , who are being transferred to other prisons . The PA is being forced to toe the line and join the Palestinian public&rsquo;s campaign of solidarity with the fugitives and the other prisoners because it does not want to be seen as sitting on the fence or , worse , being in collusion with Israel . The PA has long been facing severe criticism for its ongoing security coordination with Israel . Moreover , it regularly comes under attack for failing to secure the release of prisoners . This week , at the Jenin refugee camp , home of Zakaria Zubeidi , the only Fatah member among the fugitives , even prominent Fatah activists were critical of Abbas because of his alleged rapprochement with the Israeli government and the Biden administration . The activists accused the PA leadership of & ldquo;abandoning&rdquo ; its supporters in the Jenin area , especially the armed men who are wanted by Israel . To ensure that the mosque preachers abide by the instructions , the PA security forces regularly deploy informants to the mosques to listen to the sermons and report to their handlers . As far as the PA is concerned , criticism of senior Palestinian officials , especially during Friday prayers , is a crime that can even land the perpetrator in prison . The same applies to any preacher who dares to heap praise on Hamas or other groups opposed to the policies of the PA leadership . The PA is not opposed to mass demonstrations in the West Bank in solidarity with the Palestinian prisoners . But the PA leaders also know that an escalation could deteriorate into another all-out war with Israel , something that is likely to further undermine the PA&rsquo;s credibility and standing and boost the popularity of Hamas and PIJ , as was the case after the last Israel-Hamas confrontation in May . There are two issues that are considered the most explosive and sensitive among the Palestinians : Security prisoners and Al-Aqsa Mosque . If the Palestinians decide to launch another intifada , it will be over one or both of these issues . The dismissal of Abu Hassan and the continued crackdown on Hamas and PIJ members is yet another sign of mounting tensions between the PA and Hamas . The latest tensions began immediately after the last war in the Gaza Strip , when thousands of Palestinians took to the streets in the West Bank to celebrate Hamas&rsquo;s & ldquo;victory&rdquo ; over Israel . Scores of Palestinians have since been arrested or summoned for interrogation for participating in the pro-Hamas demonstrations or voicing support for the Islamist movement on social media platforms . The PA crackdown marks the end of a short-lived honeymoon with Hamas that began more than a year ago . The two parties have been at loggerheads since 2006 , when Hamas won the Palestinian parliamentary election . The crisis reached its peak in the summer of 2007 , when Hamas seized control of the entire Gaza Strip after toppling the PA . Since then , attempts by Saudi Arabia , Egypt , Qatar and Turkey to end the PA-Hamas rivalry have hit a snag . The administration of former US president Donald Trump , however , ushered in a period of reconciliation between the rival Palestinian parties . A plan by the government of former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to apply Israeli sovereignty to parts of the West Bank also accelerated the reconciliation process . Trump&rsquo;s plan for Mideast peace , & ldquo;Peace to Prosperity , & rdquo ; and Netanyahu&rsquo;s & ldquo;annexation&rdquo ; scheme , which were rejected by both the PA and Hamas as a conspiracy to liquidate the Palestinian issue and Palestinians&rsquo ; national rights , prompted the Palestinian leaders in Ramallah and the Gaza Strip to resume attempts to end their dispute . In July 2020 , Jibril Rajoub , secretary-general of the PA&rsquo;s ruling Fatah faction , and Saleh Arouri , deputy chairman of the Hamas politburo , announced that they had reached an agreement & ldquo;to speak in one voice and under one flag , the Palestinian flag , to build a strategic vision to face the challenges . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We are now talking about a joint struggle , a campaign on the ground , & rdquo ; Rajoub said , calling Hamas a full partner . & ldquo;We call on all Palestinian factions to see cooperation between Hamas and Fatah as a historic opportunity for a joint fight to establish a Palestinian state and oppose the Israeli occupation . & rdquo ; Two months later , Rajoub and Arouri held another meeting in Istanbul , to promote the reconciliation between the two parties . The meeting ended with an agreement to hold elections for the Palestinian presidency and parliament , as well as the PLO&rsquo;s legislative body , or parliament-in-exile , the Palestinian National Council . Fatah and Hamas leaders who later met in Cairo under the auspices of Egypt&rsquo;s General Intelligence Service agreed on the electoral voting procedures , paving the way for Abbas to issue a decree setting dates for the elections . As part of the reconciliation process , Hamas formed its own list of candidates for the parliamentary election , which was supposed to take place on May 22 . The list included 132 candidates from the West Bank , Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem . In late April , however , Abbas announced the postponement of the election on the pretext that Israel had not approved his request to hold the vote in east Jerusalem . & ldquo;Facing this difficult situation , we decided to postpone the date of holding legislative elections until the participation of Jerusalem is guaranteed , & rdquo ; Abbas declared . In response , Hamas denounced the decision , dubbing it a & ldquo;coup against the path of national partnership and consensus . & rdquo ; Hamas and other Palestinians are convinced that Abbas decided to call off the vote because of his fear that Fatah , which was running on three separate slates , was headed toward another defeat , similar to the one in the 2006 parliamentary election . & ldquo;For them , it&rsquo;s evident that Abbas used the controversy surrounding Jerusalem as an excuse to cancel the election , & rdquo ; said Palestinian political analyst Amer Ashhab . & ldquo;Abbas&rsquo;s decision was also seen by Hamas as the end of the reconciliation process with the Palestinian Authority . & rdquo ; But other analysts said the defeat of Trump in the US presidential election was another reason why Abbas decided to delay the election . & ldquo;Abbas received positive messages from the administration of President Joe Biden , & rdquo ; said political analyst and columnist Mohammed Abu Diab . & ldquo;Had Trump won , Abbas would have proceeded with his plan to achieve unity with Hamas . & rdquo ; Eager to resume contacts with the US , Abbas and other Palestinian officials in Ramallah welcomed the departure of the Trump administration and signaled their desire to resume their ties with Washington . The PA leadership had severed ties with the US after Trump&rsquo;s 2017 decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel . The departure of Netanyahu from the political scene and the formation of the new government was also received with a sigh of relief in Ramallah . The restoration of relations between the PA and the US administration and the improved ties between Ramallah and the government of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett saw Abbas move further away from Hamas . The talk about national reconciliation between the PA and Hamas has been replaced with statements by Abbas and other Palestinian officials concerning the need to resume the Israeli-Palestinian peace process . THESE ARE good & nbsp;times for the PA and Abbas , provided that this week&rsquo;s mass demonstrations in support of the Palestinian inmates do not lead to another major confrontation with Israel . The Biden administration has revived the talk about a two-state solution as the only way to resolve the conflict and stated its opposition to any steps by either side that risk sparking violence or undermining the prospect for returning to the pursuit of two states . Additionally , the Biden administration has been saying it believes Palestinians and Israelis & ldquo;deserve equal measures of security , freedom , opportunity and dignity . & rdquo ; This rhetoric , in addition to the resumption of US financial aid to the Palestinians , obviously contributed to Abbas&rsquo;s decision to again turn his back on Hamas . The Israeli government&rsquo;s decision to resume high-level contacts with the PA leadership is also seen by some Palestinians as another reason behind Abbas steering clear of Hamas . Abbas knows that he stands to gain more by aligning himself with the US and Israel than making peace with Hamas , some of whose leaders have never missed an opportunity to denounce him as a & ldquo;traitor&rdquo ; and & ldquo;collaborator&rdquo ; with the enemies of the Palestinians . For Abbas , an alliance with the US and Israel is tantamount to an insurance policy for the survival of the PA . He also knows that such an alliance does not come without a price , making him less popular among the Palestinians . On the other hand , Abbas is well aware that making peace with Hamas would only spell trouble . He is not in a rush to return to the Gaza Strip and pay salaries to tens of thousands of Palestinians . He knows that even if he returns to the coastal enclave , he and his security forces will never be able to disarm the various terrorist groups or prevent them from launching rockets and incendiary balloons into Israel . Abbas also knows that any deal he strikes with Hamas will jeopardize his relations not only with Israel , but with the US and the European Union too . When Palestinian businessman Munib al-Masri lately asked Abbas about his conditions for incorporating Hamas into a Palestinian unity government , the PA leader told him that the group must first accept all international resolutions pertaining to the Israeli-Arab conflict . Abbas , in other words , demanded that Hamas recognize Israel&rsquo;s right to exist . Hamas was quick to reject the demand , accusing Abbas of acting on behalf of the US and Israel to & ldquo;blackmail&rdquo ; the group into abandoning its ideology and principles . & ldquo;Hamas is not serious about ending the conflict with Fatah , & rdquo ; said a senior Palestinian official . & ldquo;Hamas wants to continue ruling the Gaza Strip with the hope of turning it into an Islamic emirate . Hamas is serving the agendas of foreign powers , including Iran and Qatar , who want to see the Palestinians divided forever . & rdquo ; In many ways , it is safe to assume that Abbas is comfortable with the status quo , which absolves him of responsibility for what happens in the Gaza Strip . The security coordination between the PA security forces and the IDF also serves as an insurance policy for the survival of the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah . Abbas knows that as long as Israel maintains a security presence in the West Bank , Hamas will never succeed in extending its control beyond the Gaza Strip . The current strategy of the PA is to strengthen its relations with the US administration with the hope that such a move would ensure the continued flow of financial aid to the Palestinians . And despite its public criticism of Israel , the PA leadership seems to be relatively satisfied with the new and less hostile approach of the Israeli government . The closer Abbas moves toward the US and Israel , the farther he moves away from Hamas . This leaves Hamas with one option : enhancing its ties with Iran , Qatar and Turkey as a way of tightening its grip on the Gaza Strip . The split between the West Bank and Gaza Strip , long regarded by many Palestinians as a fait accompli , is likely to continue even in the post-Abbas era because most of the officials surrounding him are not known as fans of reconciliation with Hamas .",no escape from the growing palestinian internecine tensions

2024-05-12 15:42:25.390,jpost,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu intends to present to the cabinet a new plan for ultra-Orthodox ( haredi ) conscription into the IDF , just one day ahead of a May 16 deadline for the state to outline its plans to the High Court of Justice ahead of an important hearing on June 2 , Minister-without-portfolio MK Benny Gantz revealed in a video statement on Saturday evening.According to a report by KAN , the prime minister intends to hold a preliminary vote in the cabinet on Wednesday in order to include the plan in the legal filing to the High Court , so that the court refrain from forcing the government to begin drafting all haredi men of military age.Negotiations have been ongoing in recent weeks between Government Secretary Yossi Fuchs and representatives of Israel's haredi parties in an attempt to reach a compromise , which could then be presented to the government and eventually pass as legislation in the Knesset . However , the sides have yet to announce that such a compromise has been reached.Haredi men have enjoyed a legal exemption from IDF service since Israel's founding . However , the most recent law enabling the exemption was ruled unconstitutional in 2017 , and after many delays , officially expired on July 1 , 2023 . The government gave itself an adjustment period to come up with a new plan , but that period ended on March 31 , and the state is required by law to begin drafting some 60,000 haredi men of military age into the IDF.Implications of passing draft exemptions&nbsp;The long-awaited conscription plan could trigger a political crisis . On one hand , Gantz in his Saturday video statement repeated his position that he would not support a bill that will continue to grant sweeping exemptions to haredi men , and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced in March that he would not support a plan that did not have Gantz's backing . On the other hand , the haredi parties , who are key partners in Netanyahu's coalition , have insisted that haredi men continue to receive the option to study in yeshivot full time , and also have argued that the IDF does not enable haredim who do serve to maintain their lifestyle . The departure of either Gantz's National Unity party or the two haredi parties ( United Torah Judaism and Shas ) would likely lead to political instability and even the government's collapse.Added to this is the ongoing legal case against the government's delay in drafting haredi men , and against financial support for military-age students in yeshivot . The High Court on March 28 issued a temporary order to halt the financial support and acknowledging that the state was required by law to draft haredim . The hearing on June 2 , which will be heard in front of an expanded nine-member bench , will debate whether or not to turn the temporary order into a permanent one.Israel Hayom reported on Saturday evening that the government's plan includes a gradual rise over ten years of a minimum amount of haredi draftees per year , with the goal being to eventually draft approximately half of eligible draftee every year ( some 6,000 & ndash ; 7,000 per year , out of some 13,000 students per year ) . These details could not be independently verified.Plan still exempts approximately half of haredim from IDF serviceGantz claimed in Saturday's video that the prime minister was "" acting in order to bring a plan that does not promote fair service in the state , harm the IDF draft and Israeli security and resilience . "" Gantz also criticized the timing of the prime minister's intention to present the plan just two days after Remembrance Day , and accused Netanyahu of "" taking apart Israeli society during wartime for political gain . "" Fuchs , who is facilitating the negotiations between the involved parties , refuted Gantz's claim . In a post on X , he accused Gantz of acting divisively and of criticizing a plan that has yet to be presented in full.It appeared that Gantz's criticism of Netanyahu's bill addressing the crisis of Haredi exemption/integration into the IDF was less based on having thoroughly reviewed the prime minister's latest proposal , as much as the fact that Netanyahu has consistently avoided dialogue on the issue with Gantz along the lives of a major reform.Comments by Netanyahu's cabinet secretary also indicated that the new bill could draw out any solution over a decade , a time period usually viewed as making a reform irrelevant in political terms since there will be additional elections before anything serious would change.In contrast to Gantz , Gallant has fallen silent in recent days.His position is that he tried in the recent past to shoot down Netanyahu's bill which was trying to repackage an ongoing exemption in practice as a real reform of integrating Haredim into the IDF , but that at this point he cannot single-handedly stop it.Furthermore , if expectations are rising for Gantz to quit the government over the issue of Haredim serving in the IDF , Gallant has made it clear that even if he opposes Netanyahu's bill , he will not quit.The defense minister believes that his value as the "" adult in the room "" in the current government in which he views Netanyahu as often being pushed around by National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir and Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich , who are less experienced in world affairs , is more important than any statement he might make by resigning , given that the government would still continue.It is also still always possible that four more Likud members could join Gallant to block passage of the bill , but there are no signs that the defense minister has succeeded in gathering such numbers .",politicians clash over haredi conscription ahead of thursday deadline

Goldknopf himself is a Gerrer hassid and leads Agudat Yisrael , the hassidic wing of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism Party.How much will the additional buses cost?According to the report , this request was to utilize hundreds of additional buses that will transport ultra-Orthodox guests from places with a high concentration of haredim throughout the country , with an estimated cost of hundreds of thousands of shekels .

2024-04-03 03:52:12.420,jpost,"Ongoing dramas in Israel provide ample fodder for budding novelists and playwrights : the Saturday night and other demonstrations which bring so many people of varied backgrounds together ; the difference in treatment of families of hostages by the American and Israeli governments ; the number of families whose loved ones were murdered on October 7 , who in interviews have said that not a single government minister visited them or contacted them in any way to offer condolences ; and how Education Minister Yoav Kisch has been forced to backtrack on several erroneous decisions , the most recent being the Israel Prize.Last week , the Education Ministry published the full list of this year’s Israel Prize laureates , who at the closing of Independence Day events will receive their awards not in Jerusalem but in Sderot , much to the annoyance of Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion.The list includes technology entrepreneur and Benjamin Netanyahu nemesis Eyal Waldman , whom Kisch reportedly wanted to exclude by making certain changes to this year’s Israel Prize ceremony . But when Attorney-General Gali Baharav Miara declined to defend his decision in court , Kisch had no choice other than to retract.But the controversy is not yet behind him . Both he and Netanyahu sit on a panel with President Isaac Herzog and other dignitaries as each laureate comes to the stage to receive his or her prize , and then walks along the row shaking hands and is congratulated by each of the dignitaries . Will Netanyahu and Kisch exchange a few pleasantries with Waldman and shake his hand , and perhaps offer a few words of sympathy over the loss of his daughter on October 7 ? Or will they find convenient excuses to absent themselves from the ceremony?Incidentally , in addition to Waldman , another controversial figure among the laureates will be Sephardi Chief Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef , who has spoken out against the haredi draft . Yosef will receive the prize for Torah literature and Jewish law.Three Hebrew University faculty among Israel Prize honorees ■ APROPOS THE Israel Prize , at the Hebrew University , of Jerusalem they’re kvelling , because three of the honorees are among their past and present faculty members.Prof . Gershon Ben-Shakhar has been recognized for his work in psychology research ; Prof . Ya’acov Ritov for his contribution to statistics research , and Prof . Hagai Bergman for life sciences research.In congratulating them , HU president Prof . Asher Cohen said : “ This is no less than an amazing achievement , showcasing the high academic caliber of the Hebrew University , which boasts researchers with exceptional abilities across all disciplines . ” Czech Republic moving embassy soon ? ■ WHEN THE Czech Republic opened an embassy branch office in Jerusalem in March , 2021 , it was understood that it was merely a matter of time before the whole embassy would move to Israel’s capital , with or without the approval of the European Union . The Czechs have a long history of being among Israel’s best allies in Europe . There’s a reason that Herzog chose to give Israel’s Presidential Medal of Honor to then-Czech president Milos Zeman in July 2022 . There’s also a reason that several places in Israel bear the name Masaryk.Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said after the Hamas attack on Israel that transferring the embassy to Jerusalem would be “ a desirable step . ” From recent media reports , it would seem that he is moving in that direction . If so , the Czech Republic will be the first member of the EU to open an embassy in Jerusalem , and the second NATO member state after the US to do so.Trump stays himself ■ LAST WEEK , former and possibly future US president Donald Trump gave an exclusive interview to Israel Hayom reporters Omer Lachmanovitch and Ariel Kahana , who thought it important that Israel hear what Trump had to say.Trump , being Trump , claimed that he had done more for Israel than any other US president . It cannot be denied that he did a tremendous amount , but whether he did more than present incumbent Joe Biden is a matter for debate , although Trump will undoubtedly go down in history as the president who moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem.But there’s nothing surprising in the fact that he gave his exclusive interview to Israel Hayom , which advertised it for days on end on electronic media . The late Sheldon Adelson , who launched Israel Hayom in 2007 , was one of the most generous of Republican campaign donors . Trump showed his appreciation in November 2018 by conferring the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Adelson’s wife , Dr . Miriam Adelson , who is now one of the wealthiest women in the US and the publisher of Israel Hayom.Golden Age of American Jews ? ■ SUBJECTS OCCUPYING attention of journalists working for Jewish publications , or Jewish journalists working for general media around the globe , are antisemitism , the Israeli hostage situation , Israel’s war against Hamas , and how far points of disagreement between Israel and the US and Israel and the EU will be permitted to go.A worrisome April cover story by Franklin Foer in The Atlantic is headlined “ The Golden Age of American Jews is Ending . ” It has been picked up in whole or in part by various publications outside America , including Yediot Aharonot , which translated it into Hebrew , published it in its financial supplement , Calcalist , and included in the title page of a very long article 24 portraits of prominent American Jews . There are additional illustrations throughout.There are slightly fewer portraits on the cover of The Atlantic and mostly of people different from those featured in Calcalist . The cover of The Atlantic also contains several lines in Yiddish which do not appear in the Hebrew translation . Printed in Yiddish on the left ear of the page is the statement : “ What doesn’t suit America , likewise does not suit me . What’s not good for Jews is also not good for America . ” Then , in a line across the page , above the row of portraits : “ What happened to our golden land ? ” The article was sufficiently provocative to prompt an online discussion with Foer sponsored by Harvard Hillel and introduced by Harvard Hillel Rabbi Dani Passow.Nineteenth-century Jews considered America to be “ Die goldene medina , ” and for some it certainly was – almost from day one . But for many Jews it was a tough ride through several periods of antisemitism.But according to Foer there was a discernible difference between Jews taking on the European way of life and Jews becoming Americans . “ Jews didn’t have to accept the devil’s bargain [ where ] the cost of citizenship was assimilation . In the United States , you could be your Jewish self . ” Even so , with only a few exceptions , most notably in Hollywood , Jews didn’t rise to high positions till the 1960s . In 1950 , according to Foer , there was not a single Jewish professor at Yale . By the end of the 1960s , 17 % of the professors at elite American universities were Jewish . That’s an incredibly dramatic leap in such a short space of time , and what followed was a golden age for American Jewry in almost every white-collar profession.Foer began researching antisemitism in America long before October 7 . His brother , a religiously observant Jew who lives in Brooklyn , called him to tell him of an antisemitic incident that he had experienced . That call led Foer to research antisemitism in America and to reach the conclusion that , for the foreseeable future , the golden era for Jews in America is nearing its conclusion.Ethiopian aliyah remains delayed ■ THE PEOPLE least surprised by the government’s failure in a six-month period to bring home the hostages from Gaza are members of Israel’s Ethiopian community , who have been waiting for long years to be reunited with relatives who were left behind with empty promises that their turn to set foot in the Holy Land would soon come . As horrific a situation as the hostages are in , let us not forget that Avera Mengistu has been captive in Gaza since September 2014.The issue of the Ethiopian Jews still waiting to make aliyah came up in the Knesset last month , when the delay was questioned and criticized by Yisrael Beytenu MK Oded Forer , who chairs the Knesset Committee for Immigration , Absorption , and Diaspora Affairs , and Yesh Atid MK and former Knesset speaker Mickey Levy , who chairs the State Control Committee.At a joint meeting of the two committees , Forer and Levy queried why thousands of people are still stuck in transit camps in Addis Ababa and Gondar , and why Government Resolution 713 to bring to Israel 3,000 of the 14,000 waiting people had not been implemented . The debate will continue after the summer recess of the Knesset.Meanwhile , UJA-Federation of New York has weighed in on this injustice . Gabriel Sod , the organization’s Israel-based director of government relations and media , has called on the government to stop its foot-dragging and to bring to Israel 1,226 Ethiopian Jews who have been found eligible . Hundreds of Ethiopian Jewish families have been separated through Israel’s bureaucratic ineptitude.One example is Svinor Tarkein , who came to Israel from Ethiopia in 2007 and spent six years serving in the IDF . His grandmother remained in Ethiopia , and an uncle of his who lived in Israel was murdered on October 7 . Tarkein cannot understand why Ethiopian Jews with proven blood ties to Ethiopians already resident or even born in Israel are prevented from joining them.New brain imaging center at Reichman University ■ RECENTLY LAUNCHED at Reichman University by the Rosental-Belachovsky family was the Ruth and Meir Rosental Brain Imaging Center , which facilitates interdisciplinary research and integrates the cognitive sciences with medical sciences as well as fields not typically associated with MRI research , such as law , marketing , human-machine interaction , diplomacy , strategy , and management.The center also provides guidance to researchers who are not experienced in integrating imaging into their research endeavors , assisting them from the conceptualization phase to implementation . The scope of research possibilities is endless.The center’s MRI device is a Siemens MAGNETOM Prisma 3 Tesla , a state-of-the-art research system designed for human scanning , with the capability to produce exceptionally high-quality images . It enables high-grade anatomical , functional , and metabolic scans of various body organs.Established in 2021 as part of the university’s Baruch Ivcher School of Psychology , the center was converted into an independent university entity in late 2023.Founded with the aim of helping researchers working with MRI/fMRI technology , the center plays a pivotal role in providing tailored services and an objective window into the brain before , after , or during an activity , which significantly enhances research reliability . The center also offers scanning for interdisciplinary and neurocognitive studies conducted by researchers from Reichman University , other academic institutions , and external companies and start-ups.At present , researchers at the center are engaged in dealing with post-trauma , resilience , and the impact of innovative treatment methods , alongside basic scientific research.RU founding president and chairman of the board Prof . Uriel Reichman stressed the importance of the donation of the MRI in contributing to the advancement of the university . “ We are marching towards a substantial expansion of our scope – from interdisciplinarity in the social sciences to interdisciplinarity in technology and life sciences , ” he said . “ This significant milestone will already be reflected next year , with the opening of additional laboratories , endeavors in the life sciences , and the establishment of the medical school . I have no doubt that the interdisciplinary nature of our institution and the investments made in psychology and neuroscience will yield groundbreaking research . ” Expanding on this theme , Dikla Ender-Fox , director of the center , emphasized that “ this contribution by the Rosental-Belachovsky family will pave the way for significant and pioneering research and advancements , particularly at a university that also prioritizes applied research . ” Moral compass ■ SEVERAL HEBREW media outlets last week carried a headline stating that Netanyahu had lost the north . The headline follows the statement by US Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that Netanyahu has lost his way , and the suggestion that Israel should go to elections . This did not sit well with Israelis – including those who agree with Schumer – because it was interpreted as American interference in Israeli politics.But for students of linguistics , there is interesting food for thought . To find one’s way ( at least in the traditional manner ) , one needs a compass . In Hebrew , the word for “ compass ” is “ matzpen . ” The word for “ north ” is “ tzafon , ” and the word for “ conscience ” is “ matzpun . ” The p and the f sounds are interchangeable , and because Hebrew is generally written without vowels , when one looks only at the consonants of the three words , there is an undeniable similarity . This is obvious not only in the spelling but in the meaning . North is the highest point on the compass , and a person’s conscience guides his or her decisions on issues of morality.Women's accomplishments ■ REGULAR READERS of The Jerusalem Post will have noticed the extent to which the paper’s management took Women’s History Month to heart and has boosted women leaders in numerous fields , last month bringing them together at a Women Leaders Summit.Women have reached top ranks in more industries than is generally realized.At the summit a women’s entrepreneurship competition hosted by Post and the Luzzatto Group was won by Alisa Givertz , founder and CEO of Liquid360 , who received the 2024 Next-Gen Women’s Entrepreneurship Award.Liquid360 offers technological solutions to make companies ’ sites more secure and ready for any situation.The competition for young start-up entrepreneurs took place during the summit at the Google for Start-ups Campus in Tel Aviv . Givertz was selected by a panel of judges that included Dr .

Weekly demonstrations take place in London , and British members of Parliament fear for their safety if they’re perceived as pro-Israel.Dr . David Hirsh , the CEO of the London Centre for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism , is currently in Israel and will speak on “ Responses to October 7 : the British experience . ” Hirsh has been at the forefront of the fight against antisemitism in the UK for more than 20 years , especially antisemitism and anti-Zionism in academia and on campus . He is the author of Contemporary Left Antisemitism and editor of The Rebirth of Antisemitism in the 21st Century . He has coedited a compilation of essays responding to October 7 , to be published in May of this year.Zoom audiences should be aware that the lecture will begin at 12:30 p.m . EDT .

He’s also an author and political analyst.On April 9 , JPC will give him a fond farewell reception while simultaneously celebrating its first decade of operations as a professional and social home for foreign and local journalists.That honor belonged for several years to Beit Agron , which is still home to the Jerusalem Association of Journalists , but which for some years now has ceased to be the central meeting point for journalists working out of the capital.There was a time when the offices of many foreign news agencies were in or around Beit Agron . But after the Government Press Office moved out and went to its current location in the Malha technological park , things began to disintegrate . Several international television companies rented offices in what was then Jerusalem Capital Studios , and used the various services provided by JCS . Some are still there , but JCS is not . The building was sold to the head of the Jerusalem Post Group , Eli Azur . Several of the electronic media outlets take advantage of the services offered by the GPO.Dromi was looking for a more central and easily accessible venue and , with the help of the Jerusalem Foundation , found the ideal spot in Yemin Moshe , where facilities for all media have been installed.During major media events the JPC and the GPO have worked in close cooperation.American businessman comes to help Israeli business owners affected by war ■ AMERICAN BUSINESS executive , conference speaker , author , and mentor Jay Abraham , who is known for developing successful market industry strategies , was in Israel last week and accepted the invitation of Nir Yeshaya , the CEO of the Edmond de Rothschild Group , to speak to members of the de Rothschild team and leading Israeli businesspeople in Tel Aviv.Abraham came directly from the US to help owners of businesses that have been harmed as a result of Israel’s war with Hamas.Abraham , who has been rated by Forbes as one of the top five management coaches and business gurus in the world , accepted Yeshaya’s invitation to meet exclusively with Israel’s leading capitalists to discuss strategies , management hazards , and business crises during emergency situations.This is one of many initiatives worldwide by the Edmond de Rothschild Group , headed by Baroness Ariane de Rothschild , who is the first woman and the first person without direct Rothschild lineage to head any of the Rothschild institutions.Billions of dollars have been donated from abroad ■ IF ALL the money raised for a variety of causes in Israel through and by individuals and groups in Israel and abroad was added up , the total would come to many billions of dollars . It’s amazing how Jews can get their act together during a time of crisis – but the money did not come from Jews alone.For instance , since the October 7 massacre by Hamas and the ensuing war , the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews , headed by Yael Eckstein , has presented the Association for Israel’s Soldiers with $ 4 million to be used for soldiers ’ needs . The association and the IFCJ have partnered in various initiatives since 2005.The association recently arranged for senior members of the board of the IFCJ to visit a battalion of IDF reservists on a day of R & R , which was made possible through a gift of the IFCJ.The visitors , who included Eckstein ; former congresswoman Michele Bachmann , chairman of the US board Bishop Paul Lanier , IFCJ Canada chairman of the board of directors Mark Climie-Elliott , and HaKeren L’Yedidut director-general Ayelet Shiloh Tamir , were able to speak with the reservists training on the base and hear about their service throughout the war , while the soldiers enjoyed a catered meal , recreational games and musical entertainment.Vegans and Vegetarians flock to Balfour Street ■ VEGANS AND vegetarians will be flocking to 8 Balfour Street , Jerusalem , on Tuesday evening , April 9 , to celebrate the 90th birthday of leading vegetarian advocate Prof .

2021-01-14 21:13:18.087,jpost,"United Nations envoy Nickolay Mladenov , a diplomatic pillar on which the uneasy calm that has characterized the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the last six years has rested , quietly left for his home country of Bulgaria at the end of last month . The impact of his departure on the conflict has not garnered as much attention as that of the tumultuous regime change in Washington and the electoral chaos in Israel . His absence , however , leaves a chasm in day-to-day , back-channel regional statesmanship precisely at a time of diplomatic upheaval . A former Bulgarian foreign minister , he arrived in Jerusalem from a UN posting in Iraq in 2015 at an inauspicious moment in the conflict . He took over what , during the time of his predecessor , Robert Serry , had been the highly contentious post of UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process . For almost six years Mladenov was a peace envoy without a peace process . From the moment of his arrival and until his departure , there were no direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiations . Until the final months of his posting , a larger Israeli-Arab peace process , which has now filled Israel with hope , was absent and largely considered unthinkable . During his first two years , the Obama administration had largely given up on Israeli-Palestinian peace and for the next three , the process remained frozen as both parties awaited a plan from US President Donald Trump . In an interview with The Jerusalem Post in 2016 , Mladenov spoke of the limits of his position in light of the current reality , noting that one would have to be & ldquo;day dreaming&rdquo ; to imagine that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were about to sit down to negotiate . & ldquo;We don&rsquo;t believe that , currently , the way things stand , negotiations are possible , & rdquo ; he said . In the interim , he explained , & ldquo;our role is to actually figure out how we can create the condition under which such a process can resume in a meaningful manner . & rdquo ; Then he went about showing just how meaningful small , behind-the-scenes steps could actually be . He threw out the script of how his office had operated and created a new process that met the reality he saw out his window . The Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University dubbed his form of diplomacy the & ldquo;Mladenov approach . & rdquo ; Nowhere was that felt more than in Israel&rsquo;s conflict with Hamas in Gaza , which had thrice broken out into war & ndash ; in the winter of 2008-2009 , in 2012 and in the summer of 2014 . During his six years in office , Gaza crises erupted , rockets flew and the IDF struck Hamas targets . But each time , just as Israel was on the brink of war , effective behind-the-scenes diplomacy by his office restored an uneasy calm . This included the eventual neutralization of the Hamas-led Great March of Return , which began in 2018 and sparked weekly and at times daily violent riots on Israel&rsquo;s border and included the launching of incendiary balloons against southern Israel . Part of his success was due to the fact that he was not a stranger to the Middle East and that he came from a small neutral country . He had already visited the region as a foreign minister and had ties with Israelis , Palestinians and Arab countries , including the Gulf states . He did not lose those connections , and some of them were enhanced during his time in Iraq . MLADENOV HAD an easy manner about him that made people feel as though he were their friend , even when he was critical and holding them to task . Former US ambassador Dan Shapiro said , & ldquo;He did something that others who have held that position have found difficult to do , which is to win the confidence and trust of all the relevant players . & rdquo ; This included , Shapiro said , & ldquo;the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority , the Arab states , the American and European leaders and Hamas . & rdquo ; Shapiro added that & ldquo;because he had that trust and was seen as a straight shooter , & rdquo ; he could & ldquo;call any party out for an action that needed to be addressed or changed . & rdquo ; In addition , Mladenov was & ldquo;very creative and quite determined . He was far more effective than many who have held that position , & rdquo ; said Shapiro . Mladenov not only created a mechanism of communication for defusing crisis situations with Gaza , but he augmented that with linking Gaza calm with increased humanitarian aid , in a way that offered positive incentive that gave Hamas a reason to hold its fire . From the start he breathed new life into the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism , by which construction material was allowed into the Strip to enable Palestinians to rebuild homes destroyed during the 2014 war . He helped move forward projects on water and wastewater and electricity , including increased funding . In 2018 , he expanded those efforts , bringing in extra aid , including cash for needy families , from Qatar . Mladenov was vocal about his ideas , speaking often to the Israeli public at conferences and events , including those organized by civic society groups , by way of strengthening on the ground efforts toward peace . He wrote tweets and blog posts and gave monthly briefings to the UN Security Council . At a time when few were saying anything , he was always saying something . Mladenov sided with the Palestinians on the idea of a two-state solution at the pre-1967 lines , as he warned against a one-state reality to the conflict . He was a persistent opponent of settlement activity , which he saw as a stumbling block to the conflict . But he also supported Israel in its criticism of Hamas and the PA support of terrorism and incitement , putting that critique in writing in the 2016 Quartet blueprint to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , which he helped author . During his six years , Mladenov was often the first UN official to condemn terrorist attacks or to chastise the Palestinians . He also called repeatedly for Fatah-Hamas unity and urged the PA to maintain its security cooperation with Israel and to accept the tax levies Israel had collected for it . At times he was accused by Palestinians of what they perceived to be a stance that was too pro-Israel . Mladenov had not initially believed that Israeli-Arab peace was possible prior to resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . His opinions were diametrically opposite to those of the Trump administration . Still , he has been credited with helping the US see how the threat of Israeli West Bank annexation could create a window of opportunity for Israeli-Arab normalization . Under the rubric of the Abraham Accords the Trump administration launched in August , Israel opened ties with the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Morocco and Sudan . & nbsp ; The success of those initiatives was helped , in part , by the calm that existed in Gaza , which Mladenov had helped maintain . Had there been a war in the previous two years , the option for normalization deals might not have existed . Shapiro said that Mladenov & ldquo;didn&rsquo;t resolve the conflict , obviously , but helped contain it , ameliorate it [ and ] helped resolve and prevent crises when they popped up . & rdquo ; German Ambassador Susanne Wasum-Rainer said , & ldquo;He was tireless in his efforts to make small steps that could eventually lead to bigger progress . He never allowed himself to get frustrated at any obstacles , and remained always convinced that the painful reality of the conflict for the people living here gave the UN and the international community an obligation to stay engaged . & rdquo ; She added , & ldquo;Even during all these years without negotiations between the two sides , he succeeded to uphold the international consensus on the need for a two-states solution . & rdquo ; IN SUMMING UP his own time in Israel in a blog post he wrote before he left , Mladenov said , & ldquo;I have worked on upholding the international consensus that the goal is of a two-state solution , I have warned of the dangers of the eroding status quo , supported intra-Palestinian reconciliation efforts , and , most of all , focused on preventive diplomacy . & ldquo;Together with Egypt , and with critical support from Qatar and others in the international community , the United Nations has played a pivotal role in preventing another devastating war in Gaza . I have spoken out against injustices . I have condemned terror , & rdquo ; he wrote . He added that it was a mistake to view the conflict from the narrow lens of territory . & ldquo;This conflict is not just a conflict over land , for both peoples have the right to call Israel and Palestine their home . It is not only a conflict over history & ndash ; personal and collective . It is a conflict over the very right of two nations to coexist , & rdquo ; he wrote . & ldquo;Perhaps today is not the time for big international initiatives , but the time for steps & ndash ; maybe small , sometimes maybe bold & ndash ; that protect that goal of two-states , & rdquo ; Mladenov wrote . He urged Israelis and Palestinians to seize common threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic and opportunities such as those provided by the Abraham Accords to find a way to return to the negotiating table . Seen as a rising star at the UN and as a possible UN secretary-general , he had planned to leave for a UN post in Libya . But at the last moment he bowed out for family and personal reasons , and will be replaced by veteran diplomat from Noway Tor Wennesland . He was so vocal and so omnipresent , speaking at small NGO events and shaking hands with heads of state throughout the region , that it almost seemed as though he had become a permanent fixture to the conflict . The small achievements on the Israeli-Palestinian track over the last six years have depended on a large cadre of diplomats , but Mladenov is credited as the behind-the-scenes official who maximized those efforts to keep the wheels of a two-state solution slowly churning . He was a vocal envoy of peace on behalf of both Palestinians and Israelis , who has left the stage at a time when his calming influence would have been essential to maintaining horizons of possibilities for Israeli-Arab and Israeli-Palestinian peace .","nickolay mladenov : israelis , palestinians lose envoy of peace"
2024-03-14 03:00:34.623,jpost,"The Knesset passed a law helping victims of terrorism pursue legal action against financiers and supporters of terrorism , like the Palestinian Authority , on Monday.The law , promoted by MK Yitzhak Pindros and dozens of other MKs , was approved in a vote of 19 for and two opposed . The law enables victims of terrorism and their families to demand exemplary damages from those who give wages or compensation for the organizing of acts of terrorism or are otherwise liable under Israel's Torts Law.Amounts received in such lawsuits will not be deducted from the amount paid to victims of terrorism on behalf of the state.The law also allows these exemplary damages to be taken from any property of the party sued . For example , if the Palestinian Authority is the defendant in the lawsuit , then the damages could be taken from the tax funds collected by Israel for the PA , which are currently frozen due to a law passed in 2018 aimed at stopping the PA's pay-for-slay program.The law also determines that a party that is funding terrorism through primary or secondary legislation or through regulations , the party will be considered a terrorist sponsor funding acts of terrorism that could cause death or disabilities until the contrary is proven.Approval of law welcomed by supportersSander Gerber and attorney Asher Stub from "" Justice for Terror Victims , "" who initiated and drafted the bill , welcomed the law's approval , saying , & ldquo;The enactment of this law into Israel's legal framework rectifies a longstanding injustice endured by victims of terrorism and their families . By instituting a predetermined compensation structure and facilitating the retrieval of funds from the assets of terrorism financiers , the law aims to bolster the fight against terrorism and its financial networks . Our aspiration is that this legislative measure will not only combat terrorism but ultimately pave the way for its eradication . & rdquo;Pindros also welcomed the passing of the law , saying , "" This is an important day for the fight against terrorism . This law does justice to the State of Israel , which until today has walked a tightrope on this issue .

2023-05-04 08:13:53.433,jpost,"In a joint operation in Nablus on Thursday , the IDF , the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) and the Border Police killed three terrorists responsible for the Dee family murders.Three members of the Dee family & ndash ; Lucy ( Leah ) and her two daughters , Maia and Rina & ndash ; were killed by the terrorists in early April during Passover.The three terrorists were Hassan Katan , Maad Mitzri and Ibrahim Hura . Hamas members Katan and Mitzri were the killers , and Hura was a key accomplice.While the death of the terrorists means they cannot be interrogated , The Jerusalem Post received indications that the evidence against them for the Dee murders was multifaceted , with Hamas itself claiming that the terrorists were important operational members.A statement by the IDF and Shin Bet described an extensive gunfight between the security forces and the terrorists , and the Post received indications that drones were used as well.IDF official : Nablus operation completed at ' unusually fast speed'A senior IDF Central Command officer said the operation was completed with unusual speed within an hour and not the usual several hours . & ldquo;With less talent and exactness [ in intelligence and operations ] , more IDF personnel or Palestinian civilians could have been hurt , & rdquo ; or the terrorists might have escaped , he said.Eight Palestinians were injured , he said , adding that they were not innocent bystanders . According to Palestinian reports , a fourth Palestinian civilian bystander , Ziad Shuviri , was killed during the operation . The Post was unable to confirm the accuracy of either report.The senior officer said the speed with which Israel brings terrorists to justice , whether it takes days or weeks , versus months and years , can serve either to deter terrorism or help terrorists recruit more people when the response takes too long . & ldquo;There are no safe-haven cities in the West Bank [ for terrorists ] & ndash ; not Jenin , not Nablus , nowhere , & rdquo ; he said.Overall , & ldquo;we are still in a very challenging period , & rdquo ; he added . & ldquo;The level of shooting attacks is still very high . & rdquo;The senior officer also implied that Hamas as an organization was investing more in the current wave of terrorism than it was before , when most of the attacks were being carried out by unaffiliated & ldquo;lone wolf&rdquo ; attackers.The final round of intelligence collection started early Thursday when Israeli intelligence received confirmation of the location of the terrorists , including a tip by certain Palestinian forces about the terrorists&rsquo ; vehicle , according to some reports.The senior officer did not deny the use of drones in the operation , but he downplayed their role and emphasized the role of the ground forces.IDF to use armed drones for targeted killings in West Bank?Video footage showed what appeared to be undercover Israeli security forces entering the market as local women and men to surround the area and prevent any escape before the rest of the forces moved in.Earlier in the day , the IDF confirmed that it was engaged in operations against terrorists in Nablus , without providing specifics . It kept the drone tactics under the public&rsquo;s radar.The military usually sends in foot soldiers to detain suspects or engage in combat in such cases without using drones beyond collecting intelligence . The use of drones in the West Bank could mark a new tactical shift if it were used , possibly to avoid larger friction with Palestinian civilians present in the residential areas , while maintaining the ability to carry out a more targeted attack.Until now , drones have only been used only to collect intelligence and sometimes to fire missiles to kill terrorists in Gaza , while kamikaze explosive drones have reportedly been used against Iranian targets , but not in the West Bank . & ldquo;After the terrorist attack , there was a significant intelligence effort [ that ] led to locating the hideout in the Nablus Kasbah , & rdquo ; the joint statement by security forces said . More intelligence was received early on Thursday that led to the terrorists&rsquo ; location , including the seizure of two M-16 rifles and a Kalashnikov gun , it said.The security forces said they would & ldquo;continue to act with determination to thwart all terrorist threats&rdquo ; directed at Israelis.Some soldiers reportedly were lightly wounded , but a senior IDF officer denied those reports . He did clarify that he was referring specifically to whether any soldiers were hospitalized , meaning that there is a possibility that some did experience minor wounds that were treated at the scene , without the need for hospitalization.Defense Minister Yoav Gallant praised the security forces . & ldquo;As I promised Leo [ Dee ] , the defense establishment&rsquo;s arms will reach every terrorist , & rdquo ; he said.Efrat Mayor Oded Revivi thanked security forces for the Nablus operation.The assassination of terrorists is the & ldquo;best response to terrorism , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;We will continue to hug the Dee family and strengthen as a community . & rdquo;Rabbi Leo Dee said : & ldquo;The kids and I were comforted to hear that the Israeli security forces have eliminated the Iranian-funded terrorists responsible for Lucy , Maia and Rina&rsquo;s murders . This has been done in a way that has not endangered the lives of Israeli soldiers , nor innocent Palestinian civilians , in a way that only the Israeli army knows how to do . & ldquo;Furthermore , we have asked for the opportunity to speak with the terrorists&rsquo ; families and ask what good they thought would come out of their actions and to hear their vision for a better world . & rdquo;Speaking at Shin Bet headquarters , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli security forces had killed or captured about 110 Palestinian & ldquo;murderers&rdquo ; in recent months.הערכה רבה לכוחות הביטחון על חיסול חוליית המחבלים שביצעה את הפיגוע הנתעב בחמרה בו נרצחו האם לוסי ובנותיה מאיה ורינה די . כפי שהבטחתי לליאו , אב המשפחה , ידה הארוכה של מערכת הביטחון תגיע לכל מחבל&mdash ; יואב גלנט - Yoav Gallant ( @ yoavgallant ) May 4 , 2023Rabbi Leo Dee said that & ldquo;the kids and I were comforted to hear that the Israeli security forces have eliminated the Iranian-funded terrorists responsible for Lucy , Maia and Rina&rsquo;s murders .

2021-05-26 13:18:41.093,jpost,"Thousands gathered virtually around the world to commemorate the Jews who were massacred during the Farhud pogrom in 1941 . & nbsp ; The Farhud was a pogrom that took place in Baghdad and Basra on June 1 and 2 of 1941 that culminated in the murder of 180 Jews . During the purge , hundreds were injured and the homes and synagogues within the Jewish communities were looted and burnt to the ground . & nbsp ; The ceremony was organized by David Dangoor , who is a businessman and philanthropist who grew up in the Jewish community of Baghdad and now lives in the UK . & nbsp ; Considering the recent escalation between Israel and terror groups in the Gaza Strip , Dangoor felt it was especially important to highlight this pogrom to present what happens when antisemitism runs rampant . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The Farhud was a tragic event that sounded the death knell for the oldest Jewish Diaspora community , but sadly is not well known around the world , & rdquo ; said Dangoor . & ldquo;It is vital that the Jewish world and beyond commemorate the Farhud to understand better how to deal with hate , incitement and violence , and prevent such events from happening in the present and future . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;Even up to the very end , many Jews and Arabs in Iraq refused to be enemies and lived and worked side by side , & quot ; he added . & quot;Animosity was largely imported from outside and incitement used as a tool for political goals . Unfortunately , we see many similar worrying signs in the violence in Israel , the US and Europe in recent days . & quot ; & nbsp ; The commemoration had people across the world lighting virtual candles in honor of the victims of the pogrom . Facebook users also have the opportunity to apply a filter to their profile picture . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Each Shavuot , thousands of Jews from Baghdad remember the traumatic day when 2,400 years of Jewish life in Babylon came to an end . & nbsp ; Exactly 70 years ago , on the eve of Shavuot , some 700 Jews in the city were murdered in a Nazi-led pogrom known as the Farhud ( & ldquo;violent dispossession&rdquo ; in Arabic ) . Inspired by Kristallnacht , it marked the end of one of the oldest Jewish communities in the Diaspora and showed how far Hitler&rsquo;s hatred of the Jews spread globally during World War II . & nbsp ; The Jews of Iraq had been living peacefully in Baghdad since the Babylonian era . By 1941 , they numbered around 150,000 , making up over a third of the population . & nbsp ; The monarchy in Iraq , installed by the UK , had been overthrown by the lawyer Rashid Ali al-Gaylani in April 1941 , in a violent coup one month before the Farhud . & nbsp ; Rashid Ali had strong links to the Nazi Party and the grand mufti , a close ally of Hitler . Rashid Ali indoctrinated the country with Nazi propaganda ; children in Iraqi schools were taught to praise Hitler and that Jews were a treacherous enemy , and Radio Berlin had regular broadcasts in Arabic . & nbsp ; Supported by the Nazis , he aimed to rid Iraq of Britain and to gain access to the huge oil reserves in Kirkuk . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; An order was issued to Iraq&rsquo;s air force to destroy the British RAF base in Habbaniyeh , west of Baghdad . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Although the RAF was only equipped with planes left over from World War I , the bombing campaign failed drastically , with Iraq&rsquo;s inept air force shooting down several of its own planes . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; On May 30 , Rashid Ali was forced to flee . With British ground troops advancing on Baghdad and with no leader , the Jewish community was left in a perilous position . & nbsp ; Two days later , on June 1 , the observant Jewish community was preparing for Shavuot , oblivious to a huge mob of rampaging Muslims shouting , & ldquo;Cutal al yehud ! & rdquo ; ( slaughter the Jews ) . & nbsp ; With no organized resistance , many of the Jews who survived unscathed bribed Iraqi policemen to stand guard . & nbsp ; But the violence worsened during the night , and the mob soon numbered in the tens of thousands , targeting every Jewish home in the city . The mufti had made this task simple by advising the chief rabbi to ask the still-trusting Jewish community to paint a red hamsa ( palm-shaped amulet used as a sign of protection ) on the outside of their homes . & nbsp ; While the violence continued unabated , British troops were waiting on the outskirts of the city , forbidden to enter . & nbsp ; By the second day of fighting , the mob&rsquo;s violence had spread to such a degree that Muslim shops were also being looted , and a curfew was eventually called at 5 p.m . Remaining violators on the streets were shot , and a relative calm was soon restored . & nbsp ; WHEN THE State of Israel was created , life in Iraq became unbearable , with public hangings of prominent Jews that shocked the community to new depths . When the Iraqi government finally allowed Jews to leave in 1950 on condition that they forfeit their nationality and all their money and property , the entire community registered en masse , leaving only 2,000 Jews by 1952 . & nbsp ; Sarah Ehrlich contributed to this report .",farhud pogrom commemorated with virtual candle-lighting ceremony
2021-05-12 21:12:44.770,jpost,"Despite the belligerent statements of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad over the past three days , the two groups are nevertheless believed to be looking for a way to end the fighting with Israel . But Hamas and PIJ know that they can&rsquo;t reach any deal with Israel without the blessing of their patrons in Iran . In the past few days , Hamas and PIJ leaders spoke to Iranian officials about the latest flare-up of violence . It is unclear , however , whether Tehran is interested at this stage in a ceasefire . Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh , who is based in Qatar , told Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif during a phone call on Monday that efforts were being made & ldquo;on the diplomatic and field levels to halt Israeli assaults on our people in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip . & rdquo ; Haniyeh was referring to Egyptian and Qatari mediation efforts to reach a ceasefire with Israel . Haniyeh was obviously seeking Iran&rsquo;s approval of a possible truce that could be reached under the auspices of Egypt and Qatar . Hamas and PIJ officials have told Egyptian , Qatari and other mediators that they would be ready to stop their attacks on Israel once Israel stops its military offensive in the Gaza Strip . Musa Abu Marzouk , deputy head of the Hamas politburo , said on Wednesday that Egyptian and Qatari mediation efforts have thus far been unsuccessful . Abu Marzouk&rsquo;s statement came amid unconfirmed reports that Egypt was planning to send an Egyptian security delegation to the Gaza Strip to hold talks with leaders of Hamas and PIJ about ways of reaching a new ceasefire with Israel . Abu Marzouk told the Khaleej Online news website that Hamas was holding contacts with several Arab and Islamic countries about the situation in the Gaza Strip . & ldquo;There was talk about mediation efforts that are appreciated by our brothers in Egypt and Qatar , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;We appreciate their care for our Palestinian people , but these mediation efforts have not culminated in a return to calm until now . & rdquo ; Abu Marzouk accused Israel of & ldquo;igniting&rdquo ; the fighting . Israel , he said , & ldquo;must stop and retreat from its steps , as it is the only party that bears full responsibility . & rdquo ; The Hamas leadership told the mediators that its message was clear , which is to & ldquo;strengthen the position of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem and at al-Aqsa Mosque , and the steadfastness of families threatened with expulsion from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah , & rdquo ; Abu Marzouk added . The Hamas official was later quoted by Palestinian news websites as saying that the Europeans have also contacted his group to explore the possibility of reaching a ceasefire with Israel . & ldquo;The Europeans contacted us and asked us to stop firing short-range missiles [ at Israel ] or else they will not participate in the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip , & rdquo ; Abu Marzouk said . & ldquo;I told them we will stop our short-range missiles and use long-range missiles . & rdquo ; Abu Marzouk did not provide details about the identity of the Europeans who reportedly contacted Hamas . Meanwhile , Hamas on Wednesday admitted for the first time that a number of its senior military commanders were killed in Israeli airstrikes .

2024-04-14 19:04:58.933,jpost,"President Biden spoke with the "" big four "" leaders on a call Sunday to discuss Iran's unprecedented attack against Israel , according to White House pool reports . & nbsp;On the call , Biden discussed the urgent need to pass the national supplemental as soon as possible on a call Sunday , Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-NY ) , Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-KY ) , Speaker of the House Mike Johnson ( R-LA ) , and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries ( D-NY ) . The only aid package for Israel that will get to President Joe Biden's desk is the Senate-passed supplemental bill which includes military aid for Ukraine , Taiwan and Israel and also humanitarian aid for Gaza , Ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Sen . Gregory Meeks ( D-NY ) said Sunday morning on MSNBC . & nbsp;Meeks reiterated Biden's stance that US defensive support for Israel is "" ironclad . "" On Saturday night as US forces intercepted Iranian missiles and UAVs targeting Israel , House Republican leader Rep . Steve Scalise ( LA ) said this week's legislative schedule will be changed to bring forward legislation to support Israel . & nbsp;Details of this coming week's legislative changes have yet to be announced as of Sunday morning . & nbsp;In early November , the Republican-led House passed a plan to provide $ 14.3 billion in aid to Israel and cut funding to the ternal Revenue Service.But because it combined aid for Israel with a cut to the Internal Revenue Service and left out aid for Ukraine , President Joe Biden promised a veto and Senator Chuck Schumer , majority leader of the Democratic-controlled Senate , said he would not bring it up for a vote.Senate supplemental billIn February , the Democratic-led Senate passed its supplemental bill which would give $ 60.06 billion in aid for Ukraine , $ 14.1 billion to Israel , $ 2.44 billion for operations in the Red Sea and almost $ 4.82 for partners in the Indo-Pacific to deter aggression by China . & nbsp;The Senate bill would also provide $ 9.15 billion in humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza , the West Bank , Ukraine and other populations in conflict zones around the globe . & nbsp ; "" The Administration strongly encourages both chambers of the Congress to reject this political ploy and instead quickly send the bipartisan Emergency National Security Supplemental Appropriations Act to the President&rsquo;s desk , "" the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a statement in February . & nbsp;Former President Donald Trump is the leading Republican voice opposed to sending additional funding to Ukraine . Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson , a close Trump ally , declined to allow a House vote on the Senate supplemental bill for months . Johnson met with Trump on Friday in Florida , fueling speculation about whether Trump will clear a vote on Biden's national security spending request . & nbsp;However , not every Republican is siding with Trump . & nbsp;McCaul on Ukraine and IsraelIn an interview Sunday morning on CBS ' Face the Nation , House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Michael McCaul ( R-TX ) said he will be speaking with Johnson on Sunday night about the dire situation in Ukraine . & nbsp;McCaul said an option for Israel's response to Saturday night's attacks would be to take out the facilities where Iranian drones or rockets come from , and also destroy the manufacturing facilities that build them . & nbsp;Not just for Israel's sake , McCaul said , but also for Ukraine because the rockets and drones are being bought by Russia and are used to kill Ukrainians . & nbsp;What happened in Israel on Saturday night happens in Ukraine every night , McCaul said . & nbsp;McCaul told CBS ' Margaret Brennan that he needs to educate his House colleagues on how Israel , Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific are all tied together . & nbsp ; "" Iran is selling this stuff to Russia . Guess who's buying Iran's energy ? China , "" McCaul said , which is happening because the Biden administration lifted sanctions on Iran and helped fund their terror operations , he added . & nbsp;McCaul said he's an "" eternal optimist "" and is doing his part . He said in World War II the US didn't choose its enemies , it went after Japan , Italy and Germany all together . & nbsp ; "" We just can't pick and say Iran is bad , Russia is okay and China is bad .

Weimann said he found a 1,100 % increase in antisemitic messaging on the platform between 2020 and 2021 . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Either TikTok is not willing to regulate against antisemitism or it has not been able to , & rdquo ; he said .

2024-03-27 21:59:50.563,jpost,"On Wednesday , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leaders of the haredi parties failed to come up with a new compromise on the controversial issue of the haredi exemption from IDF service that would enjoy legal backing from Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara.The attempts at a new compromise were aimed at convincing the Supreme Court & ndash ; ahead of a midnight deadline & ndash ; to give the government a few more months to have the plan pass into law . The attorney-general is the government&rsquo;s legal representative in the Supreme Court , and she requested that the court give her until 2:00 p.m . on Thursday to file the government's official response.According to Israeli media outlets , a leaked draft of the response revealed that Baharav-Miara intends to claim that the state is no longer authorized to avoid recruiting yeshiva students , and should begin the process of drafting them from April 1 onwards . Regarding state funding to yeshivot , the A-G is expected to request that the funding cease but not immediately , so as to give the yeshivot time to adapt to the change.The government&rsquo;s proposal has been viewed as too weak because the haredim have refused to commit to specific quota numbers of draftees per year or to any financial or criminal sanctions for those who do not comply . Baharav-Miara said that without some minimal numbers and sanctions , it would be hopeless for her to try to defend the bill before the High Court of Justice.It was expected that the government would ask for an additional postponement , given the inability to reach a deal to keep the government intact , with some reports suggesting a request for an additional 10 days . It was unlikely that the High Court would give the government much of a postponement , if any , and in the past , the High Court has often only granted a shorter extension than whatever the government had requested to keep up the pressure.The court could also just let the issue play out at the hearing scheduled for Thursday and demand answers from the government throughout that hearing . In the most extreme case , the court could order an immediate universal draft until the government puts in place an alternative.Fuchs blames attorney-general's officeCabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs wrote a letter to government ministers on Wednesday in which he blamed the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office for the government&rsquo;s inability to pass a decision on time . Fuchs argued that the A-G&rsquo;s office initially refused to support the decision for what it described as a & ldquo;procedural&rdquo ; reason , namely that the decision did not include an opinion by the defense ministry . On March 24 , however , the A-G&rsquo;s office again refused on the same grounds , saying that the lack of a defense ministry opinion served as a & ldquo;legal impediment . & rdquo ; Fuchs argued in the letter that the A-G&rsquo;s office contradicted itself and had not made it clear in advance that the defense ministry opinion was legally obligatory . He added that the reason the defense ministry opinion was unattainable was because Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was not participating in the procedure . & ldquo;The door to the vault of government approval has been locked by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and there is no key since , from a technical standpoint , it is impossible to receive the professional underpinnings from the defense ministry , & rdquo ; Fuchs wrote . & ldquo;Until this moment , the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has not pointed out any core problems or problems whatsoever in the government&rsquo;s decision and has not raised a & lsquo;black flag&rsquo ; over it , & rdquo ; Fuchs accused.Gallant refuted the claim that his ministry had not cooperated , saying in a written statement soon after Fuchs&rsquo;s letter was published that the allegations were & ldquo;biased and false . & rdquo;According to Gallant , & ldquo;every request that was received regarding cooperation with the professional echelon in the defense ministry or a piece of data regarding the conscription law was approved and will continue to be approved . & rdquo ; However , the defense minister repeated a prior pledge that he would only support a bill that was supported by & ldquo;the entire&rdquo ; emergency government , which includes Minister-without-Portolio Benny Gantz , head of the National Unity Party.Opposition leader MK Yair Lapid said in response to Fuchs&rsquo;s letter , & ldquo;The government&rsquo;s wonderful ability to evade any responsibility is impressive , and tonight , who is to blame that there is no conscription law ? The attorney general ? You got it wrong : The blame is on those who are attempting to whitewash draft-dodging and discriminate between groups based on blood . & rdquo;A source from United Torah Judaism expressed the party&rsquo;s frustration with the prime minister . & ldquo;He [ Netanyahu ] signed an agreement . We wanted to pass [ a new conscription bill ] before the government&rsquo;s formation ; he delayed . We agreed [ to pass the bill ] before the budget [ passed on May 23 ] ; he delayed . If he wants a government , he must ensure that yeshiva students can study Torah , & rdquo ; the source told The Jerusalem Post in a text message.Gantz also threatened earlier this week to leave the government if an unsatisfactory conscription bill passes into law.In terms of viable alternatives and compromises that the government could adopt , there is a spectrum of ideas that other parties have presented , and there could also be variations on those proposals.The closest way to a compromise would be some variation on Gantz&rsquo;s proposal of all haredim having to do national service , with a more symbolic number serving in the IDF.This would not truly address all of the IDF service inequalities that have angered the public for decades , but it would at least show the majority of the population that the haredim were ready to contribute to the national destiny in a physical and quantifiable way . ( Haredim claim they care for the spiritual sustenance of the nation ) . Also , if more Israelis from other sectors were being pulled out of necessary jobs , the haredim stepping in with national service would cover some of that gap.Advocates of the Gantz compromise say it would temper some economic impacts and start a social transformation within the haredi community by connecting and contributing more to the nation.In practice , IDF sources have said they cannot integrate all of the draft-eligible haredim and that it would probably take years to do so , if at all doable . They explained that there are too many social and educational issues to work through to take in haredim in anything other than gradual numbers . & nbsp;Above a certain volume , it is not even clear that the IDF wants to spend the amount of resources necessary to integrate so many Haredim at once.The lack of an agreement about how to solve the crisis is part of what has continued to allow the consistent rejectionist haredi position to prevail over the last several months , not to mention for decades before October 7 . & nbsp ;","israeli gov't in crisis as netanyahu , haredi parties fail to reach idf draft deal"

It is one of the largest fuel tanks in Israel and is located in a unique facility in the entire Middle East.Moshe Kaltzyn , CEO of the Energy Infrastructure Directorate : "" We are distributing fuel to every corner of the country . We can provide fuel immediately , in a process that takes only a few hours . We have millions of liters here , enough for the long term . You can be confident with the quantity we have here . "" According to the National Emergency Authority's attribution scenario , during an expected war in Israel , up to 48 hours of blackouts , covering 60 % of the country's territory , are anticipated.Energy backup systemEstimates suggest that during combat in the northern arena , Israel's gas facilities will be shut down , and electricity supply will switch to operate on the basis of fuel and coal . The vast amount of fuel in the reservoir is expected to suffice for an extended emergency period.Israel's backup system includes storage capabilities above and below ground throughout the country . When needed , fuel will be distributed to all energy consumers in the country - power stations , Ben Gurion Airport , and fuel stations.If fuel imports to Israel are completely halted during a war or extreme scenario , the electricity supply will need to be managed with these existing reserves - undoubtedly a challenging task . "" This fuel here can last us for many years . The temperature throughout the year is 22 degrees , which effectively preserves the shelf life of the fuel , "" explains Moshe Elimelech , facility manager.Energy Minister Eli Cohen : "" We have energy reserves underground and above ground , including gas , coal , and various fuels , and we are working to provide a responseben gu as needed . The rumors of long weeks or months of power outages are baseless , and the likelihood of that happening is remote . """,israel hides energy reserves in secret location in negev desert
2024-05-17 02:49:52.020,jpost,"El Al reportedly humiliated an Israeli-Bedouin police officer while he was on an Israel advocacy mission to the United Kingdom , according to Israeli media.Sgt . - Maj . Ramo Salman Huzeil , an investigator at the Segev Shalom police station , reluctantly became famous on October 7.He was assigned to security at the Nova Music festival in the morning shift , arrived at the scene eight minutes before 6:30 am , then became a hero who took the initiative , organized an escape vehicle , and , while under fire , made dozens of rounds of the site of the festival massacre , saving hundreds of people , whom he moved to safety , only to return , again and again , saving more and more people.In the days that followed , the media wanted to interview him , and his story grabbed headlines in Israel and worldwide.Following his heroism and the publicity he received , he was sent to London about two weeks ago as part of an awareness campaign for the State of Israel to gather support for the call to release the hostages.The initiative was part of the & ldquo;Israel is&rdquo ; Association , which has set itself the goal of & ldquo;creating high-quality , genuine , and universal meetings&rdquo ; between Israelis and young people worldwide.Israel advocacy campaignHuzeil , whose career in the Israel Police made him an even more fitting ambassador for the country , was very proud of his role.However , according to him , his elation upon returning from this mission was cut short by hostility when he received what he claimed was a humiliating security check before boarding El Al flight 326 at its connection at the Paris airport . & ldquo;Is this the thanks I get ? & rdquo ; he asked.Not worthy of respect ? & ldquo;I returned from a mission in which I represented the State of Israel , our country . We met with the Jewish communities in England , high-ranking , wealthy people ; we met with lords and members of parliament ; and in the end , I went through an experience that made me feel second class after they checked me as if I were a criminal , as if I am not worthy of respect . & rdquo;As Huzeil , 38 years old and father of three , tells his story , his voice breaks and tears choke him . & ldquo;I am an investigator in the Israel Police . This appears in their system , and I also showed them my ID when they asked , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;They put me through an illogical examination and asked unnecessary and intrusive questions , which made me feel like I was under investigation like I was guilty of something . It could be that the examiner wanted to embarrass or lower my value and dignity : I have no other way to explain it . I left there feeling terrible , and when I retell it , it brings me back to those moments , and I experience it again . & rdquo;Huzeil said the investigator & ldquo;also refused to identify herself , but she wanted to know how many children I have , what their names are , if I have another passport ( I have a Swiss one , I showed her ) , how long I have known the women in the delegation that I flew back with , where I was , what I did , etc . & ldquo;I told her that she was talking to a police officer and not a regular citizen , "" he said . "" She didn&rsquo;t care at all and asked if my big bag had a lock or not ; I was already annoyed by her disdain and also by her treatment of me in a humiliating manner . If this is how they treat a police officer and investigator who was at the Nova Festival and saved hundreds of human lives , I don&rsquo;t know if there is anything left to say . & ldquo;The fact is that the two girls who were with me did not go through the same experience and were released to board the plane very quickly , & rdquo ; Huzeil said . & ldquo;Only I was asked disgusting questions . I&rsquo;m a police officer , and they interrogated me more than an ordinary citizen . It was a humiliating and unnecessary experience . & rdquo;In response , El Al stated that , & ldquo;First of all , we are very sorry for the passenger&rsquo;s feelings . The security screening procedure for passengers is based on security reasons only , in accordance with the guidelines of the authorized bodies and the professional aviation security procedures . & ldquo;We would like to emphasize that during the conversation held by the security representatives at the airport with the passenger , no special findings or problems came up , and they always made sure to treat the passenger with respect and courtesy , "" the airline said . & ldquo;The Israeli aviation security establishment and El Al are full of appreciation and gratitude for the actions of Mr .

2024-05-18 08:06:55.460,jpost,"Not long ago , Walter Bingham celebrated his 100th birthday , but as he phrases it , he has entered his 101st year of life.I first met Walter in Jerusalem when I was working at a radio station , where he was featured on its Aliyah Show . A long-time experienced broadcaster , he was subsequently offered his own show , Walter&rsquo;s World . I was the sound engineer and frequently joined Walter for live broadcasts and to cover news events.Walter quickly adapted to the new , ever-changing technology , and his hand-held digital recorder and microphone became his constant companions . We went backstage to interview performers at music festivals , and politicians at rallies.With his outgoing personality and relaxed style , Walter was always able to get guests to open up.Today , he records and edits two programs covering current events , as well as human interest stories : Walter&rsquo;s World on Israel National Radio ; and The Walter Bingham File on Israel News Talk Radio.Despite his age , he often joins the international media to cover events at dangerous locations.Walter also spends time commemorating the memory of the Holocaust through frequent speaking engagements . Last May , he spent a week in the Berlin area talking to schoolchildren about his youth in Germany and the rise of Nazism.In October , he was hosted by the March of the Living organization , which promotes Holocaust education , for a special reenactment of the Kindertransport , which saved up to 10,000 children from the Nazis . He traveled with one of three other kinder from Israel to several locations in Germany , and then to Holland and England , reenacting their journey in 1939 . That was how Walter survived the war ; he was sent to England on the Kindertransport , where he grew up without his parents.Throughout the journey , they were interviewed and filmed for a documentary , which captured touching moments.When the ferry left the port of Hoek Van Holland , emotion welled up as Walter remembered waving goodbye to Europe and awaiting freedom in England , as he did 84 years ago.I had the opportunity to interview Walter about the experience for my podcast , Jewish History Moment.Kindertransport Refugee Walter Bingham Returns to Germany by Ben BreskyWalter Bingham describes the Kindertransport reenactment , modern German attitudes to Jews post-Holocaust and his travel to Europe during the Israel-Gaza war.Kindertransport Refugee Walter Bingham Returns to Germany by Ben BreskyWalter Bingham describes the Kindertransport reenactment , modern German attitudes to Jews post-Holocaust and his travel to Europe during the Israel-Gaza war.Read on SubstackGermans then vs todayWalter explained that he had previously returned to Germany in 1988 , but the attitudes were different . & ldquo;I was invited by the municipality , who were very nice , but the population didn&rsquo;t seem to care about us . Nobody smiled , nobody waved , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;This time it was different . We were approached by locals in Germany . You couldn&rsquo;t miss us because we had two cameramen , a sound man , and lighting . The Germans were friendly , interested , and very happy to see us . The atmosphere was so much different . & rdquo;Walter&rsquo;s trip to Germany coincided with the Oct . 7 attacks in Israel , and he commented on how the president of Germany traveled to Israel in a display of support.Walter explained that 1988 was too soon after World War II . & ldquo;That generation were the children and grandchildren of those who voted for Hitler . They were still indoctrinated , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;It takes several generations to take the poison out of their system , although there is still an element of neo-Nazis in Germany . & rdquo;In February 2024 , March of the Living hosted Walter to again speak in London for three major events . This month , he went to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial in Poland with March of the Living for Holocaust Remembrance Day , where he recited Kaddish at the end of the commemoration.The Nazi daggerWhen Walter speaks about his wartime experiences to groups , he has a visual presentation with pictures , photos , and charts that explain antisemitism and the Nazi era.Among the items he passes around to the audience is an authentic Hitler Youth dagger with a swastika . The blade is inscribed with the words & ldquo;Blood and honor&rdquo ; in German . & ldquo;For me it meant Jewish blood , & rdquo ; Walter explained , & ldquo;because after school , I saw my fellow pupils marching in Hitler Youth uniforms singing & lsquo;When Jewish blood spurts from the knife , everything goes much better . & rsquo ; & rdquo;British ArmyAfter arriving in England with the Kindertransport , he spent several years on a religious kibbutz training camp in Wales.Walter then went to London and joined the British Army . In June 1944 , he landed on the beaches of Normandy . For his extraordinary action , he was awarded the Military Medal for bravery in the field by King George VI . He also received France&rsquo;s highest honor , the L&eacute;gion d&rsquo;honneur.As a fluent German speaker , he was eventually transferred to London to train as a documents specialist and counter-intelligence operative . On VE Day ( May 8 , 1945 ) , he was sent to Hamburg , where he was given an office in the former Nazi party headquarters of the greater Hamburg area.Among the numerous interviews he conducted was one with Nazi foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop , who denied all knowledge of the Holocaust , although he oversaw all anti-Jewish activities in Nazi-occupied Europe . He was the first of the senior Nazi leaders to be executed after the Nuremberg war crimes trials.After the war , Walter made a life for himself in England . Following his BA , he obtained a post-graduate degree in political philosophy from the University of London . That helped him to take up a career in radio journalism.Modeling careerTo supplement his income , Walter grew a beard and was in demand as an actor and advertising model . He was Santa Claus at Herrods , England&rsquo;s premier department store , and for several years in London&rsquo;s Selfridges department store.In documentaries , he played Charles Darwin , as well as other interesting parts . Advertisements with his photo could be seen in posters on London buses and underground stations.I was even filmed with Walter . A Jerusalem-based musician was shooting a music video for Purim and asked for volunteers . When Walter and I showed up , they were especially glad to see him and promptly gave him the role of Mordechai.Today Walter , who made aliyah in 2004 at age 80 , has become a known name in Israel among the English-speaking community , journalists , and the many diplomats he has interviewed . President Isaac Herzog visited him on his birthday.Among his many honors , he holds two Guinness World Records : as the oldest working journalist in the world , and the oldest active radio show host.Plans for the futureAs a pilot , Walter once flew his airplane solo from England to Israel . One of his most emotional moments was circling low over Jerusalem , with tears running down his cheeks . For his 95th birthday , he went skydiving and is planning another jump within the next several months.His birthday cake this year bore the words & ldquo;Until 180&rdquo ; instead of the usual wish & ldquo;Until 120&rdquo ; because as Walter says , there is still much more work to be done . ■ & lsquo;Kaddish&rsquo ; in BirkenauWalter Bingham participated in the 2024 commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Day in Poland and recited mourners&rsquo ; Kaddish in front of 7,000 participants.The commemoration included 55 Holocaust survivors , several of whom were also survivors of the Oct . 7 Hamas attack in Israel . & ldquo;It was very emotional , & rdquo ; Bingham told In Jerusalem.The event , organized by March of the Living , begins at the Auschwitz concentration camp , with students and others marching to the ruins of the Birkenau camp . A series of speeches and prayers took place near where the Birkenau gas chambers were located.Among the participants were Rabbi Yisrael Meir Lau , a survivor and former chief rabbi of Israel ; popular Israeli singer Noa Kirel , who sang & ldquo;Eli Eli&rdquo ; ; and IDF Chief Cantor Shai Abramson , who recited the El Maleh Rachamim ( Prayer of Mercy ) . Bingham noted that March of the Living had distributed blue jackets and Israeli flags to participants , giving the impression of a sea of blue as they marched.Many of the participants pledged to pay homage to the survivors and made a commitment to transmit the history and lessons of the Holocaust to the next generation .","100-year-old friend : talking with walter bingham , the world's oldest journalist"
2021-06-12 23:13:16.720,jpost,"Incoming prime minister Naftali Bennett will be sworn in on Sunday in the shadow of last month&rsquo;s Gaza war , domestic Jewish-Arab unrest and amid the threat of renewed IDF-Hamas hostilities , particularly over Jerusalem . & nbsp ; The sequence of events that are likely to unfold in the coming week , let alone the coming month , would be a test under fire for any prime minister , but will present a unique challenge for this particular government because of its unorthodox composition . & nbsp ; The new coalition headed by Bennett of the right-wing Yamina Party and incoming foreign minister Yair Lapid of the centrist Yesh Atid Party also includes left-wing parties and the Arab Islamist Ra&rsquo;am Party . & nbsp ; It&rsquo;s a coalition that has an unprecedented ideological range and many of the decisions that it makes are likely to involve principled compromises by one or more of its members . & nbsp ; The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the most contentious and divisive arena for this coalition and issues relating to it are expected to be one of its weakest links . & nbsp ; It&rsquo;s precisely here , on the Israeli-Palestinian front , the new coalition will be tested , both within its first week and its first month in these four ways . & nbsp ; 1 . Evyatar outpost evacuation & nbsp ; Defense Minister Benny Gantz , who will retain his role in the new coalition , is poised to evacuate the West Bank outpost on Monday , less than 24 hours after the government is sworn in . The outpost was built last month in the aftermath of a Palestinian terror attack at the West Bank Tapuah junction , in which Yehuda Guetta , 19 , was killed . It was erected on a spot that settlers had first attempted to settle in 2013 in the aftermath of a Tapuah junction terror attack in which Evyatar Borovsky , 31 , was killed . & nbsp ; The reconstruction of the outpost named in Evyatar&rsquo;s memory was largely ignored by the IDF . Within a month&rsquo;s time , close to 50 families had moved onto the site . & nbsp ; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s plea to Gantz to allow the community to remain was ignored , so only direct intervention by Bennett can prevent its evacuation . & nbsp ; Should Bennett intervene , he would likely anger the left-wing flank of his coalition , as well as some of its centrist members , such as Gantz , who heads the Blue and White Party . & nbsp ; Such an evacuation , however , risks inflaming the West Bank and setting off a chain of violent events . Past outpost evacuations were often followed by violent retaliatory attacks by right-wing Jewish extremists against Palestinians . This would come at a time when Hamas is already attempting to inflame the West Bank . & nbsp ; 2 . The Flag March & nbsp ; Police on Friday approved a parade route for a right-wing Flag March set for Tuesday , just one day after the anticipated West Bank outpost evacuation . & nbsp ; The annual event is typically associated with Jerusalem Day events that mark the celebration of the city&rsquo;s unification in the aftermath of the Six Day War , in which Israel captured the eastern part of the city from Jordan and subsequently annexed it . & nbsp ; During Jerusalem Day last month , however , marchers were prohibited from following their traditional route through the Old City&rsquo;s Damascus Gate and the Muslim Quarter , and were instead expected to head through the Jaffa Gate . Hamas fired seven rockets at Jerusalem during the march , thereby officially bringing it to a halt . This month , march organizers had sought to hold the march along its original route and in the end brokered a compromise with the police by which they would dance with flags by the Damascus Gate that opens into the Muslim Quarter . & nbsp ; The area in front of the gate has been one of the city flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian violence . Police closure of the area briefly as a place of Palestinian gathering in April during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan was one of the initial sparks that led to May&rsquo;s violent outbreak . & nbsp ; An Israeli flag dance by the Damascus Gate , which for the Right is an important symbol of sovereignty over the city , is similarly expected to ignite renewed Palestinian violence . & nbsp ; 3 . Palestinian evictions in Jerusalem & nbsp ; There are four existing land issues in Jerusalem that could lead to the evictions of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in three east Jerusalem neighborhoods . & nbsp ; The one that captured both media attention and that of Hamas last month was the fate of some 28 families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood . The High Court of Justice has yet to decide whether to weigh in on the matter or to allow for the evictions to move forward . No date has been set for its decision . & nbsp ; But dates do exist for additional cases . The attorney-general is expected by the end of June to issue an opinion on a land case in Silwan&rsquo;s Batan al-Hawa that could impact at least 700 Palestinians . & nbsp ; Another land case regarding al-Bustan in Silwan that could impact more than 1,000 Palestinians has been delayed until August . Some 13 families , however , could be in danger of losing their homes , irrespective of that ruling , because they fall under the dictates of the Kaminitz Law , which blocks them from seeking any additional legal recourse . & nbsp ; One such Palestinian family was already given a notice last week that he has 21 days to destroy half his home , otherwise the municipality would move to knock down that portion of his abode . It&rsquo;s a demotion that could equally spark violence and the pending evictions that neighborhood have been under intentional scrutiny . & nbsp ; Lastly , the issue of pending evictions in the Walaja neighborhood of east Jerusalem is also due back in court on June 21 . & nbsp ; The Right has viewed each of the cases as land issues . The ones in al-Bustan and Walaja involve municipal plans for parks . The cases in Sheikh Jarrah and Batan al-Hawa involving property disputes between Palestinians and Jews . & nbsp ; But they are seen within the larger context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and placed within the prism of the battle for sovereignty in Jerusalem , with the Left and the Palestinians believing that the eviction are an attempt by the city to seize control of Palestinian neighborhoods for Jewish projects and residents . & nbsp ; The neighborhood battles have sparked tension and violence , with the European Union and the US weighing in on behalf of the Palestinians . Hamas has also threatened violence as a result , and the issue of Sheikh Jarrah , in particular , was one of the sparks that led to May&rsquo;s violence . & nbsp ; 4 . Gaza & nbsp ; The IDF-Hamas 11-day war ended on May 21 , but it&rsquo;s unclear if the calm is a lull in the war or the end of this round of violence . Hamas has already renewed its threat of more rocket fire with regard to the Flag March and there exists a real chance it could make good on its threat . & nbsp ; Bennett and Lapid&rsquo;s coalition could be in the position in its first week of deciding whether and how to retaliate should that happen . It would mark the first time that Israel would have a coalition with divergent views on how to handle Hamas rockets . & nbsp ; When Netanyahu became prime minister in 2009 , Hamas had been in charge of Gaza for less than two years , having ousted Fatah in a bloody coup in 2007 . The initial Gaza policy and the first Gaza war occurred under former prime minister Ehud Olmert&rsquo;s watch . & nbsp ; The bulk of the Gaza policy , however & ndash ; including the 2012 and 2014 wars , as well as the border restrictions on goods & ndash ; has been set by Netanyahu . It was one of the areas of consensus within his government . The disagreements that existed centered around the question of whether Israel had been hash enough , rather than too lenient . & nbsp ; Bennett , who often criticized Netanyahu for not doing enough on Gaza , particularly with respect to the tunnel threat , will now have to decide how harsh a response he would authorize . & nbsp ; Even without violence , other questions must immediately be answered , particularly with regard to what type of goods can enter Gaza and what mechanism can be put in place to ensure that Hamas cannot divert materials for military use . & nbsp ; The terms of the calm between the IDF and Hamas that is now in place have yet to be set . Egypt is mediating indirect talks . It is still attempting to finalize those details while at the same time attempting to create a permanent ceasefire that could include the return of the remains of two IDF soldiers and the release of two Israeli citizens held by Hamas . & nbsp ; All these issues must now be dealt with by the Bennett government , with the possibility that the failure to find a satisfactory response could lead to renewed violence . & nbsp ; Egypt has also chosen this time to become more involved in Gaza , a move that could potentially lower the possibility of renewed Hamas rocket fire , but which may lead to tension points with Israel .",bennett @ @ @ s first four under-fire tests on the israeli-palestinian conflict

In addition , 11 Holocaust survivors died from the evacuated northern settlements of Shomrat , Metula , Kibbutz Dan , Shlomi , and Kibbutz Yir&rsquo;on.The data shows that some of the 238 Holocaust survivors who were evacuated to hotels returned to their homes or moved to other places . In the city of Ashkelon , 122 Holocaust survivors left hotels , while in Sderot , 33 Holocaust survivors left . Most of the Holocaust survivors who were evacuated from the north , on the other hand , remained in the evacuation centers , like much of the other residents . From Kiryat Shmona , for example , only two Holocaust survivors left the hotels , as well as two from Metula and seven from Shlomi.About 2,500 Holocaust survivors experienced the difficult events of October 7 . About 2,000 Holocaust survivors were forced to abandon their homes and evacuate to a safe area as a result.In the meantime , the ministry notes an increase in the number of Holocaust survivors who are assisted by welfare services . According to the data , this applies to 42 % of Holocaust survivors in Israel . As of 2024 , the office provides services to approximately 48,610 survivors , compared to 45,300 last year . 22,893 of the Holocaust survivors receive services from various frameworks of the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry , mainly through support communities . 1,710 survivors receive assistance through the social payments system , receiving mainly material and financial assistance . 5,110 receive services from the Friendship Fund in cooperation with the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry.In addition , more than 1,000 Holocaust survivors are assisted by a remote welfare program and a connected program - programs to alleviate loneliness and strengthen intergenerational ties through two-way digital communication technology systems for remote contact and physical meetings , which aim to improve the quality of life of Holocaust survivors in the community in terms of reducing loneliness and a sense of belonging , promoting a healthy lifestyle , and promoting digital literacy.Israeli government and ministries seek to alleviate difficulties for survivorsThe Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry added designated standards for the care and assistance of Holocaust survivors in local authorities , alongside the expansion of community services to all senior citizens in the State of Israel and various programs.Welfare and Social Affairs Minister Ya&rsquo;akov Margi said : "" This year , more than ever , we have an obligation as a ministry , as a society , and as a community to embrace Holocaust survivors , many of whom experienced the events of the terrible massacre on October 7 and brought back to them difficult memories of the terrible Holocaust . "" "" At a time when the State of Israel is fighting for its right to exist and when terrible antisemitic events and demonstrations take place every day in cities and campuses around the world , the generation of Holocaust survivors are our light and moral compass and the beacon of faith in our righteousness . The people , many of whom have experienced the horrors of both times , are testimony to the rise of Israel and the strength and resilience of the Jewish people , "" he concluded . & nbsp;Director General of the Welfare and Social Affairs Ministry , Yinon Aharoni , said : "" Aid and support for Holocaust survivors is at the heart of the ministry's activities , and we are constantly working to diversify and expand the programs and services for this population . The goal is to personally reach every survivor , and to lay out before them all the rights and services they deserve . Our debt as a country and citizens to the survivors of the Holocaust is enormous , and we must work every day to make sure that they will live a good life with good health and a supportive and wide social network as possible , and this so that they will not lack anything .

2022-06-10 19:59:24.543,jpost,"Fifty-five years after the 1967 war , the status of the West Bank ( aka Judea and Samaria ) and of its Palestinian Arabs residents remains unclear , temporary and officially disputed.Because the war&rsquo;s outcome was unexpected , Israel&rsquo;s government at the time did not have a ready framework for the future . In the best of Jewish traditions , ministers and pundits spent weeks , months and then years debating the issues , waiting in vain for the Palestinians to respond substantively . & nbsp;For more stories released for the 55th anniversary of the Six Day War , click here.In this vacuum , some Israeli groups created facts on the ground that evolved into settlements and cities on ancient Jewish biblical sites , while the army established positions that , in some instances , became towns . The result was chaotic , with no strategic or political coherence . Unlike almost every other country , Israel does not have clear borders and operates two parallel legal systems & ndash ; one for pre-1967 Israel , and another for the residents of the post - & rsquo;67 territory.Another unplanned result is the gradual morphing of the land from the Mediterranean to the Jordan River into a single political entity , in which the Palestinian and Jewish populations of approximately the same size are locked into waves of terrorism and response.For the Palestinians , the 55-year status quo keeps alive the illusion of moving the clock back to 1947 , abetted by massive international support for a unique and mythical & ldquo;refugee&rdquo ; status . The image of a single state in which half or more of the population is Palestinian , and where Jews ( Zionists ) eventually disappear like the Crusaders , is far more appealing than a & ldquo;two-state solution , & rdquo ; which would acknowledge the legitimacy of Jewish sovereignty , regardless of borders.While many Israelis have become accustomed to the stalemate , for outsiders & ndash ; including many Jews & ndash ; Israel is presented by the NGO industry in cartoon-like portraits of colonial settlers , apartheidists and serial killers of journalists , accompanied by the slogans and myths of international law . When Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in Jenin , Israel was automatically accused of & ldquo;cold-blooded murder , & rdquo ; ignoring the absence of evidence . In part , this demonization reflects hostility to Jewish empowerment & ndash ; in other words , antisemitism & ndash ; regardless of borders , and reinforced by NGO propaganda campaigns . The post-1967 images , however inaccurate and unfair , make this easier.In parallel , after more than five decades , tens of thousands of families living outside the 1949 & ldquo;Green Line&rdquo ; face outbreaks of chaos and uncertainty . Disputes over land ownership lead to years of legal proceedings and unpredictable court decisions . This absurd situation is unimaginable for people living a few kilometers away , on the other side , in & ldquo;sovereign&rdquo ; Israel.None of these observations are new & ndash ; indeed , they should be obvious . Not obvious at all is what can be done in 2022 to replace the status quo with a better and realistic framework , if one can be found . The search for alternatives that avoid the drift and end the chaos is critical for the future of Israel and Zionism.The goal here is not to propose another imaginary peace plan & ndash ; there are plenty of these gathering dust on physical and virtual diplomatic and academic shelves . Rather , my objective is to contribute to a renewed Israeli debate on options and alternatives to the status quo , based on where we are now , in June 2022 . The hope is that through a substantive discussion anchored in political realism , Israel can move beyond the trap of continuing chaos leading to a single non-Zionist state.Diplomatic Dead Ends : 1967-2022Before considering alternatives , a brief summary of previous efforts is worthwhile , at least to avoid some of the illusions and mistakes.Immediately after the 1967 war , euphoric Israelis , who feared the worst just a few days before , were suddenly able to enter Jerusalem&rsquo;s Old City and visit the ancient biblical sites that had been previously closed to Jews . A return to the narrow armistice lines ( drawn in green on maps ) that had prevailed since 1949 was , and remains , unthinkable.Unlike Egypt and Syria , there was no international border in the West Bank to serve as a basis for negotiation & ndash ; Jordan&rsquo;s Arab Legion had occupied this territory for almost 20 years , including eastern Jerusalem , and allowed fedayeen to launch murderous raids into Israel . Going back to the previous situation was a non-starter & ndash ; the question was , and remains , what should replace it?In addition to holding Jerusalem , officials agreed that the Jordan River would remain as Israel&rsquo;s eastern border , with a buffer and access zone in the Jordan Valley . But from here , the views diverged . Foreign Minister Yigal Allon presented a plan in which small areas such as Gush Etzion ( from which Jews were expelled in 1948 ) would be incorporated . But most of the West Bank would revert to Jordan , noting that : & ldquo;From a demographic standpoint , a Jewish majority will be kept/maintained , which would allow Israel to exist as a democratic Jewish state , based on the principles of the Zionist vision . & rdquo;In contrast , minister-without-portfolio Menachem Begin adamantly rejected foreign sovereignty over any parts of the Land of Israel , including Judea and Samaria & ndash ; the biblical terms that were also used during the British Mandate . However , while agreeing with Allon on demography and Zionism , he rejected annexation , even as prime minister a decade later . Begin&rsquo;s alternative was autonomy for the & ldquo;Arab population in the Land of Israel , & rdquo ; including control of education , finances , services and other sectors & ndash ; everything except security and foreign policy.Neither Allon&rsquo;s nor Begin&rsquo;s proposals went beyond the debating stage , primarily because the Palestinians were only interested in turning the clock back to 1947 & ndash ; in other words , the elimination of Israel . Nothing caused them to abandon the & ldquo;all-or-nothing&rdquo ; approach and consider pragmatic compromise , such as a & ldquo;two-state solution&rdquo ; or a federation with Jordan.IN THE POLICY vacuum , the Israeli presence in these areas gradually and chaotically increased . Periodically , another attempt at change would start & ndash ; for example , in 1987 , then-foreign minister Shimon Peres negotiated secretly with Jordan&rsquo;s King Hussein in London & ndash ; but this was another dead end.The Oslo Accords , signed in 1993 and accompanied by a White House extravaganza , marked the most sustained effort , including the creation of the Palestinian Authority , which governs more than 90 % of the Palestinian population . To Israelis , Oslo was presented as embodying the & ldquo;land for peace&rdquo ; formula , leading to a permanent status agreement and presumably two states within five years . The term & ldquo;end of conflict&rdquo ; was used frequently , and the demographic threat to Zionism seemed to be averted.But to Palestinians , PLO leader Yasser Arafat marketed Oslo as a short-term tactical measure , to be renounced once the benefits had been realized . The massive UNRWA & ldquo;refugee&rdquo ; support system remained intact , and the incitement and terrorist attacks continued and even increased in the form of mass terror directed , or at least approved of , by Arafat . Israelis recognized that on the other side , nothing had changed . And Israel&rsquo;s improved relations with the so-called & ldquo;international community&rdquo ; evaporated quickly when the IDF moved to counter Arafat&rsquo;s war.The next effort to end the stalemate took place in 2005 , when prime minister Ariel Sharon unilaterally & ldquo;disengaged&rdquo ; from Gaza and from two small civilian locations ( & ldquo;settlements&rdquo ; ) in Samaria . Two years later , the Hamas terrorist organization took control of Gaza , followed by the acquisition of thousands of rockets and missiles , and the construction of massive terror tunnels . Sharon became incapacitated in 2006 , Israel failed to destroy the nascent Hamas war machine and discussion of further unilateral withdrawal from the West Bank came to a halt , particularly with the election of Benjamin Netanyahu in 2009.But Netanyahu also understood the difficulties inherent in an infinite stalemate , leading him to support the initiative for unilateral annexation ( & ldquo;extension of sovereignty&rdquo ; ) . Details were not revealed and no official maps were made public , but the discourse focused on incorporating the major settlements and the strategic areas of Area C ( including the Jordan Valley ) . However , the effort became mired in Israeli electoral politics as well as strong international opposition , and in 2020 , it was officially halted in the context of the Abraham Accords.As this brief history demonstrates , after 55 years , the temporary status quo , with all of its weaknesses , continues . At the same time , the default option of a single political entity between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River , with roughly equal populations and the implications for Zionism , also remains & ndash ; and as noted , is the Palestinian&rsquo;s favorite . These problems will not disappear , and as Israelis , we have the obligation of continuing to look for better options.A Strategy of Political RealismWith this dismal history , it is not surprising that many Israelis have given up . The long drift and its implications are not included in the election platforms of any of the main parties , and that is precisely the problem . It plays into those who are not exactly supporters of Zionism and see the evolution of a one-state framework as the best path to their objectives.To move forward by learning from the failures , a new strategy is long overdue , anchored in political realism and concrete Israeli interests , as distinct from hope , faith or ideology . Realism requires the careful analysis of the relative potential costs and benefits of different options , including continuing the status quo , based on security ( military capabilities , defensible borders ) ; Zionism and demography ( a viable Jewish majority ) ; and the perception of Israel from the outside ( public diplomacy and image ) . On this basis , and unlike Oslo and the other experiments , I suggest starting from the end point & ndash ; Israel&rsquo;s urgent need to determine our borders . Once we examine , debate and then decide on the areas we need to hold and where Israel&rsquo;s and Zionism&rsquo;s interests are best served by exiting , the paths necessary to reach this outcome can be considered.Beyond maintaining the integrity of Jerusalem , particularly the Old City and its sacred sites , the core pragmatic requirement is to maximize security and minimize control over and responsibility for the Palestinian population . In Israel today , about 80 % identify as Jewish as compared to 20 % Arabs . Among the world&rsquo;s other nation-states based on a dominant ethnic , religious or linguistic group ( as distinct from inherently multi-cultural countries ) , a minority of 20 % is already considered quite high , particularly when that minority has recidivist claims . Borders that would reduce the Jewish majority to 60 % , for example , would add significant strains to the Zionist Jewish Hebrew-speaking core.In examining other basic elements , there is already wide agreement on the need for full control of the strategic Jordan Valley and the main access corridors to defend it . Similarly , the settlement blocs adjacent to the pre-1967 Green Line and within the separation barrier are readily incorporated into Israel , without including a large Palestinian population . There are also a few exceptions & ndash ; sizable settlements located in non-contiguous areas , such as Ariel and Beit El . But with populations of 20,000 and 7,000 , respectively , abandoning them is politically unrealistic.THE REMAINING issues concern the future of Area C & ndash ; which , under the Oslo accords , remains , at least in theory , under full Israeli control . Extending from Jerusalem east to the Jordan River , and north along the Jordan Valley , this land is important strategically , and has a small Palestinian population . & nbsp;However , in the absence of a coherent policy , the Palestinians and their European support team are busy creating their own settlements & ndash ; precisely in order to disrupt Israeli requirements . The Palestinian & ldquo;villages&rdquo ; that have been created in key locations like Khan al-Ahmar and Masafer Yatta , including fictitious backstories to persuade outsiders of their authenticity , are attempts to foreclose the option of retaining this territory . The more time that passes before deciding which parts of Area C should become part of Israel , the more difficult this process will become.The final dimension concerns perceptions . For some Israelis and Diaspora Jews , the most painful aspect of the post-1967 status quo is the image of the Jewish state as an occupier , portrayed as brutally denying the Palestinians their own state . This is the basis for campus Boycott , Divestment and Sanctions resolutions and other denunciations of Zionism.The question is whether demonization would decrease significantly if the status quo was replaced with declared borders , particularly if these were recognized by the United States and at least some European countries . Would the Jews who have become hostile to and alienated from Israel because of the 55-year & ldquo;occupation&rdquo ; move to a more positive relationship with Israel?On these questions , the evidence is unclear . The image of Palestinian weakness and victimization , in contrast to Israeli power , will not change regardless of any moves in the West Bank , and Israel will still be blamed . However , there is reason to expect that among those not committed to the Palestinian cause and anti-Zionism , the demarcation of borders would reduce the hostility . Nevertheless , based on a realistic assessment , the potential change in perceptions of Israel based on the setting of clear borders and an end to the temporary post-1967 & ldquo;occupation&rdquo ; should not be considered a deciding factor.In summary , while the results are far from certain & ndash ; and changing the status quo after 55 years will be difficult to accomplish , particularly in the face of intense ideological opposition & ndash ; the greater danger to Israel and Zionism comes from continued drift and chaos . & nbsp;The longer we allow the illusion of temporary arrangements to fester , the more difficult it will be to deal with the results . ■ The writer is emeritus professor of political science at Bar-Ilan University and president of NGO Monitor .

2024-04-30 18:08:35.823,jpost,"Ministers to the right and left of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued dueling threats on Tuesday to leave the government over the possibly impending decision of whether or not to move forward with a deal with Hamas to release some of the hostages being held in Gaza.The statements came after US officials said on Monday that new progress had been made in negotiations for a & lsquo;humanitarian&rsquo ; deal to release between 20 to 40 hostages , in which Israel reportedly would suspend its plans to enter Rafah , the last major Hamas stronghold that the IDF has yet to attack , as well as enable Gazans to return to Gaza City and release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.The far-right flank of Israel&rsquo;s government , Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir pressed Netanyahu to shun the deal and move forward with an invasion of Rafah and threatened to leave the government if the prime minister decided otherwise.In a video statement following a closed-door meeting with Netanyahu on Tuesday afternoon , Ben-Gvir said that the prime minister had promised that Israel would invade Rafah , that the war would not end , and that there will not be a & ldquo;reckless&rdquo ; deal.He added that he believed that Netanyahu & ldquo;understands what the consequences are if these things do not happen , & rdquo ; hinting that he would leave the government if such a deal was made.Smotrich , in a press conference , demanded that Netanyahu not wave a & ldquo;white flag&rdquo ; of surrender by agreeing to the Egyptian-brokered deal . He said that Israel was facing a fork in the road with & ldquo;no middle&rdquo ; , in which it needed to choose between & ldquo;decisive victory&rdquo ; and & ldquo;defeat in the war and humiliation , & rdquo ; and said that he was willing to pay a & ldquo;political price&rdquo ; if Netanyahu decided to move forward with the deal . He added that the government did not have a & ldquo;right to exist&rdquo ; if it went through with the hostage deal as it stood.Gadi Eisenkot responded&nbsp;In response to both ministers , National Unity Minister-without-portfolio Gadi Eisenkot issued a rare statement warning that he would not be a partner in a government that makes decisions based on & ldquo;political considerations&rdquo ; . & ldquo;The cabinet defined the goals of the war six months ago , & rdquo ; Eisenkot said in a written statement that he also posted on Facebook . & ldquo;In the past day , two cabinet members have been using political threats to commit extortion . This is a serious phenomenon that harms Israel&rsquo;s national security . I will only be a partner in a government that makes decisions based on the national interests of the State of Israel , and not on political considerations . & rdquo;During a meeting earlier on Tuesday with forums of hostage families and families of fallen soldiers who are affiliated with the right and support invading Rafah , Netanyahu pledged that Israel would invade the city with or without a deal . & ldquo;The idea that we will halt the war before achieving all of its goals is out of the question . We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there & ndash ; with or without a deal , in order to achieve the total victory , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said.According to the press statement of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office , & ldquo;The prime minister listened to their call to continue achieving the goals of the war and to withstand the international pressure . & rdquo;The two forums that met with the prime minister were the Hope Forum , which includes families of hostages , and the Heroism Forum , which includes families of fallen soldiers . Both are affiliated with the right and have largely called to increase military pressure in Gaza . These are separate from the larger Hostage and Missing Families Forum , which has taken an increasingly critical stand against the government.Opposition leader MK Yair Lapid said in response to Ben-Gvir , & ldquo;The state of Israel has become hostage to people who are crazy and irresponsible . This cannot continue . A minister with a criminal record stands in the prime minister&rsquo;s office and threatens the prime minister about the consequences if he does not do as he is told . Ben-Gvir is saying to the whole world and the whole region that Netanyahu is weak and working for him . It is unbelievable that he was not fired on the spot . & rdquo;The coalition currently includes 72 Knesset members . Ben-Gvir and Smotrich together have 14 seats , and without them the coalition will be left with 58 Knesset members , and will no longer have a majority in the 120-member Knesset . & nbsp ;","eisenkot , far-right ministers threaten government over hostage deal"

He lit fires while others flashed laser pointers to dazzle the settlers in their homes . & nbsp ; Israeli troops have shot dead five Palestinians during stone-throwing protests since Evyatar was set up , Palestinian officials said . & nbsp ; The IDF said it faced & ldquo;hundreds of Palestinians throwing stones , lighting fires , burning tires and throwing explosives&rdquo ; at its troops . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The large number of violent rioters endangers the lives of Israeli civilians and a military force has been deployed to provide protection , & rdquo ; it said in a statement . & nbsp ; The Israeli military did not comment on fatalities , but said troops used live fire only as a last resort . & nbsp ; Palestinians call the site of the Evyatar outpost & ldquo;Jabal Al-Sabih&rdquo ; or & ldquo;The Morning Mountain , & rdquo ; because the sunlight strikes it early . & nbsp ; Evyatar&rsquo;s creation is unusual in that its organizers , the Nahala movement and the Samaria Regional Council , galvanized 50 families to live there within a month and built modular homes for them and paved roads . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; It&rsquo;s is one of the fastest outpost creations in the history of the settlement movement . & nbsp ; The settlers have until Monday to appeal to the Supreme Court , a military spokesman said , although the decision over the evacuation ultimately rests with&nbsp;Prime Minister Naftali Bennett . & nbsp ; The decision whether to raze the outpost or allow it to remain is considered a test for Bennett&rsquo;s new government , which is made up of parties from the Left , Right and Center of Israel&rsquo;s political map . & nbsp ; On Thursday MK Nir Orbach from Bennett&rsquo;s Yamina party made a solidarity visit to the outpost in an effort to help its families who had settled there as an act of great faith . & nbsp ; In a statement he released after the visit he said he would meet with relevant authorities so the matter could be advanced . & nbsp ; Meretz parliamentarians Mossi Raz and Gabi Lasky , who are also in the coalition arrived to call for the community to be evacuated . & nbsp ; The IDF has already said that Evyatar was illegally built and must be removed and & ldquo;we support that , & rdquo ; Raz said . & nbsp ; Gantz ( Blue and White ) has also spoken of the need to remove the outpost as has Foreign Minister Yair Lapid ( Yesh Atid ) . & nbsp ; Bennett has yet to issue a statement on the outpost , located in the Samaria Region of the West Bank near the Tapuah Junction . It was built in the aftermath of a terror attack at that junction which claimed the life of Yehuda Guetta , 19 . & nbsp ; A similar initiative to build an outpost there began in 2013 , just after a Palestinian terrorist killed Evyatar Borovsky , 31 . It failed when the IDF razed the outpost . & nbsp ; Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the outpost could be legalized and the Samaria Regional Council has explained that it is constructed on survey land , which can be reclassified as state land . & nbsp ; It has already filed a master plan to the Civil Administration to legalize it . & nbsp ; The Left-wing group Peace Now said that the outpost is built on land that belongs to the villages of Yatma and Beita . & nbsp ; & ldquo;A small group of people is creating facts on the ground that effect dramatically Israel&rsquo;s security and its foreign policy , without any authority , & rdquo ; Peace Now said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The new government must not accept that . This outpost must be evicted not only because it is deepening the occupation of the Palestinians in the West Bank but because it is bad for the security of Israel and bad for the possibility of future peace for Israel , & rdquo ; it added . & nbsp ; Eli Shapira , a 30-year-old teacher and father of four , said & ldquo;They won&rsquo;t drive us away from here .

2024-03-14 22:43:30.633,jpost,"The last week has been an anatomy of a spiraling brawl between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden.First , there was the & ldquo;hot mic&rdquo ; moment last week in which Biden , in an incident that many thought was scripted , was heard telling politicians that he wanted to have a & ldquo;come to Jesus meeting&rdquo ; with Netanyahu.That was followed by Biden&rsquo;s attack on Netanyahu on Sunday , when during an interview with MSNBC he said the Israeli Prime Minister & ldquo;is hurting Israel more than helping Israel . . . it is contrary to what Israel stands for , and I think it&rsquo;s a big mistake . & rdquo;On Monday a US Intelligence Assessment report speculated that Netanyahu could be overthrown . In speaking about that report before a Senate committee CIA Director William Burns said , & ldquo;I worry that Netanyahu&rsquo;s conduct in the war threatens to undermine support for Israel in the long term including in the US . & rdquo;A senior Israeli official responded by accusing the Biden admiration of attempting to overthrow Netanyahu&rsquo;s government.On Thursday , in a prolonged speech before the Senate , its Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-NY ) called for new elections to replace Netanyahu charging that he was an obstacle to peace and arguing that he and his & ldquo;extremist government&rdquo ; cannot remain in place once the war winds down.He even appeared to hint at conditioning military aid , a sentiment once expressed only by politicians on the left-wing flank of the Democratic Party , such as Senator Bernie Sanders ( D-VT ) . It was a speech that vastly expanded the narrative to one that extended beyond Netanyahu and Biden , to include the entire Democratic Party.That Schumer is the highest-ranking Jewish politician , a centrist within the party , and an avid Israel supporter , made the blow even harsher.Israeli outcry falls flatIsraeli politicians were quick to decry US interference in the democracy of one of its closest allies , a tried and true refrain used for such moments.It fell someone flat , however , in light of the impact Israel&rsquo;s policies are having both on antisemitism in the US and the upcoming US Presidential elections.One could see Schumer&rsquo;s speech within the context of US domestic politics , as a sign of how nervous the Democratic Party is about retaining the White House in November and the impact the Gaza war could have on Biden&rsquo;s reelection chances versus his adversary , former US president Donald Trump.One could even see it as the start of the Democratic messaging , now that Trump and Biden this week have clinched enough support to become their party&rsquo;s presumptive nominees.Opponents of the Gaza war in America often refer to it as & ldquo;Netanyahu&rsquo;s war , & rdquo ; scapegoating him as the cause of the conflict rather than Hamas.Netanyahu , who was already at odds with Biden and the Democratic Party over his judicial policies before the war , had already been viewed as a person-non-grata in Washington.Now it appears that instead of turning Israel into a pariah , they are turning him into one.Once Netanyahu&rsquo;s biggest problem was that he didn&rsquo;t have a Washington invite , now it is that the Democrats are being blunt about wanting to overthrow him.Democrats will explain to their voters that they support Israel , not its government and that if needed , they will not hesitate to show Israel some tough love.It&rsquo;s a message that of course plays well for Republicans who have historically embraced Netanyahu , known for his strong relationship with Trump.Senator Tom Cotton ( R-AR ) called Schumer&rsquo;s comments & ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo ; and & ldquo;offensive . & rdquo;Republicans who were expected to campaign on strong support for Israel , now have extra fodder for their arguments.Those who worried about the interplay between the Gaza war and the US elections , now have seen the opening act of what will likely be an increasingly contentious Democratic-Republican rift over Israel.The Gaza war and the ensuing Israeli-US diplomatic battles over it will likely make or break the political careers of politicians on both sides of the ocean and both sides of the aisle in Washington.But when the dust has settled and the election season is over , the overall Israeli-American relationship will have taken a hit . Those ties are strongest when Israel remains a bipartisan issue.This week&rsquo;s drama is a warning shot across the bow , of how a raucous and fateful election could create a Jerusalem-Washington crisis .",netanyahu a pariah in washington ? that’s a crisis for israel - analysis

To reserve a place , call ( 02 ) 800 1717 . The latest day for reservations is Sunday , April 14.Luxury hotel turns apartment ■ BACK IN the days of the old Knesset when luxury hotels in Jerusalem were few and far between , the Eden Hotel at 25 Hillel Street , a relic from the period of the British Mandate , served as a home away from home for ministers and MKs who lived a long way from Jerusalem.Built in 1938 and exuding a certain grandeur of a bygone era , it later served as one of the offices of the Immigrant Absorption Ministry . Then , like so many old buildings , it stood in a state of neglect for several years . It is now being partially restored as an integral feature in a development plan for luxury residences that will be built by Yossi Avrahami.The starting sale price per unit is NIS 3,200,999 . If all roads in Israel lead to Jerusalem , the development of this project proves that point . A large signboard that lists the names and contact details of people responsible for the acoustics , interior design , engineering , and installations such as air-conditioning and elevators includes where these people are located & ndash ; and it&rsquo;s much farther afield than the distance between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv . They also come from Haifa , Hadera , Bnei Brak , Ramat Gan , Neveh Ilan , Ganei Tikva , Netanya , and beyond.But there are also indications that people are leaving the city . In the immediate vicinity , just around the corner of the block at both ends , stores have been vacated and bear & ldquo;For Rent&rdquo ; signs.Property in upscale Balfour building goes unoccupied ■ REGARDING RENTED premises , the apartment in the old , well-preserved upscale building at 15 Balfour Street that was occupied by justice Esther Hayut during her years as president of the Supreme Court has been unoccupied since her retirement in October because Justice Minister Yariv Levin refuses to approve a successor in accordance with the traditional seniority system.Meanwhile , there are two placards on the fence & ndash ; one by Gilinski Investments and Properties , and the other by Helen Duman Realty . The security booth within the grounds has been unmanned for months.Herzog hosts iftar ■ WHEN LARGE numbers of people are invited to a reception or a dinner at the President&rsquo;s Residence , they are asked to come two hours early because each of the invitees must go through a security check , which is a time-consuming procedure . Usually , the period prior to the actual event is spent chatting and networking beneath the pergola leading to the main hall . Assorted refreshments are served in plentiful supply.But when President Isaac Herzog last week hosted an iftar [ Ramadan fast-breaking ] dinner for Arab mayors , ambassadors of mostly Muslim-majority countries , and families whose loved ones were still being held hostage in Gaza , there were no pre-dinner refreshments because Muslims fast during the month of Ramadan , and the iftar feast of breaking the fast is held after sundown . According to tradition , the fast is broken by eating a date that is sweet and slightly juicy.Some of the guests had never been at the President&rsquo;s Residence , and a special tour was provided for them.Just as they do for the Independence Day reception for diplomats , the Herzogs came out approximately half an hour before dinner to be photographed individually or in group scenes with their guests . Such scenes were captured for posterity as guests excitedly photographed each other.Several , when photographed , adopted buddy-buddy poses , and Herzog , aware of how important this was for them , obliged and put his arm around one set of shoulders after another.Later , inside , all the speakers , including President Herzog , spoke of the significance of working together.Ali Salem , a senior executive member of the Federation of Local Authorities in Israel , called for a ceasefire in Gaza . Looking around at some 150 people gathered in the main hall , Salem asserted that each of them is capable of making peace.He underscored that even after the events of Oct . 7 , Arab and Jewish mayors & ndash ; all of them citizens of Israel & ndash ; continue to sit together to discuss mutual problems and to try to find solutions.This is the only way , he insisted , punctuating his speech again and again with references to negotiations around a table.He also said that Arab mayors are totally in support of Herzog in his efforts to find ways in which different communities within the country can work together for the mutual benefit of all.From what was said throughout the evening , it appeared that & ldquo;coexistence&rdquo ; is out and & ldquo;partnership&rdquo ; is in . All speakers referred to working together in partnership to achieve peace , harmony , solidarity , and progress.Salem also referred to the mounting violence which is causing fear in the Arab sector , and asked that Israel law enforcement authorities apply themselves more to eradicating this violence.greerfc@gmail.com",grapevine : making seder

2022-12-12 16:21:29.037,jpost,"Gaza-based terrorists control a number of social media accounts claiming to be Israeli women , in an attempt to catfish Israelis and expose them to harm , the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) approved for publication on Monday afternoon.The Palestinian terrorists used photos of real Israeli women for the profiles , including several accounts detected by Shin Bet that was using the name "" Maria David "" or "" Maria Shimon . "" The accounts ' owners impersonated an Israeli fitness trainer on both Facebook and Instagram , in an attempt to make contact with Israeli civilians or IDF male soldiers . & nbsp;These profiles were later removed by the social media platforms following the intervention of the cyber unit in Israel's state attorney's office.In a statement , the Shin Bet issued a warning to Israelis that terrorist groups are using social media to "" lure in innocent civilians in a manner that poses a threat to their personal security . "" The Israeli military has thwarted several similar attempts by Hamas to honeypot troops in recent years.Previous Hamas honeypot attemptTwo years ago , the phones of hundreds of soldiers , including combat soldiers , were compromised . The IDF thwarted the attempt by the Gaza-based terror group in an operation they called & ldquo;Rebound . & rdquo;In April , an extensive fake profile network on Facebook operated by Hamas was uncovered by security forces . The network , reportedly operated by Hamas for several months , was used for surveillance and obtaining sensitive information on the targets , according to Cybereason , the US-based and Israeli-owned company that uncovered Hamas ' operation , said.The fake accounts mainly targeted young Israelis who serve in the IDF and other security establishments or Israelis who work at emergency services.Another Hamas honeypot attempt was discovered and foiled in July , when seemingly innocent profiles operated by the Palestinian terror organization approached Israelis on Telegram and various social networks that dealt with soccer and dating and tried to implant spyware under the guise of a puzzle app.The app would allow the attacker , Hamas , to gain almost complete control over the soldier&rsquo;s device . It would then be used to gather critical information and even track the soldier.The network was identified after a soldier reported a suspicious conversation that he had with someone on Telegram .","shin bet foils palestinian catfishing operation on facebook , instagram"
2023-12-15 01:51:48.687,jpost,"The war in the Gaza Strip is continuing for its third month and Israeli military casualties are mounting . In an interview with The Media Line's Felice Friedson , the Israel Defense Forces international spokesman , Lt . - Col . Jonathan Conricus , discusses the short - and long-term goals of the war and says Israel is paying a heavy price , but its goals remain unshaken : Hamas must be toppled , he says , and the hostages being held in Gaza , who still include 17 women and children , must be returned . Israel has no other choice.Conricus says the Israeli army has exposed hundreds of meters of tunnels , some of which are very sophisticated . Many of the tunnels lead to homes , and house after house is filled with weapons , explosives , and rocket launchers . One possible scenario for destroying the massive underground city is flooding it with seawater , an option Conricus didn&rsquo;t dismiss . & ldquo;At the end of the day , & rdquo ; he tells The Media Line , & ldquo;these tunnels will hopefully be the undoing of Hamas . & rdquo;The Media Line : Lt . - Col . Jonathan Conricus is the international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces . Thank you so much for taking the time to be with me here at The Media Line.Lt . - Col . Conricus : Thank you for having me , Felice.TML : On the day that Israel declared war on Hamas , those speaking on her behalf stressed that the path to victory would be a slow one , deliberate and costly . Now , some 68 days into the conflict , observers are amazed that rockets continue to fly into Israel , and that the Hamas fighting remains pretty lethal . What "" unexpecteds "" have you encountered in the last two months?Lt . - Col . Conricus : So , we&rsquo;ve been fighting for 68 days , since the 7th of October , and as we said from the beginning , even before we started ground operations in Gaza in order to dismantle Hamas , we said that we understand and know that it is going to be a long and difficult fight , that unfortunately we are going to have to pay a price in blood in order to achieve our goals , and that it will not be easy , but that our resolve is very clear.And all of us , soldiers in the IDF , and officers , commanders , the High Command , all understand that we have to dismantle Hamas in order for Israeli civilians to be able to go home.Now , we have seen Hamas continue to operate throughout the war , and we see that they still retain certain rocket firing and combat capabilities . Unfortunately , yesterday we had a mass casualty event in Shejaiya [ in the northern Gaza Strip ] where 10 Israeli soldiers were killed from the Golani Brigade and our elite aerial rescue unit , our tactical Air Force unit [ 669 ] . So there are still pockets of resistance in northern Gaza , and the fight isn&rsquo;t over there . There are still rocket launches and there are still tunnels , and there are still terrorists there . Of course , greatly degraded , but still there . And in southern Gaza , specifically in Khan Yunis , the fighting is ongoing and it will take a lot of time and a lot of effort in order to dismantle Hamas , but we shouldn&rsquo;t confuse time and patience with a lack of resolve.The resolve is very clear , and we are going to defeat Hamas . There is no other option.TML : Lt . - Col . Conricus , looking at the bloodshed , the loss of lives of your soldiers , did you underestimate , did the IDF underestimate , the power of Hamas?Lt . - Col . Conricus : I think what we can say safely is that Hamas has prioritized their military capabilities over everything else , and we can see as our forces advance and as we clear areas , houses , neighborhoods , and parts of cities from Hamas terrorists after we defeat them and dismantle the enemy activity there , what we expose is hundreds of miles of tunnels , hundreds , almost a thousand , tunnel shafts . Some of them are very high-tech and high-level and a high finish of infrastructure . And we find house after house full of weapons , IEDs , explosives , rocket launchers , and anything that Hamas could get their hands on.So what I think I can see is that I think it&rsquo;s clear where Hamas priorities have been . They definitely have not been developing Gaza , caring for civilians , building civilian infrastructure , schools and hospitals and mosques and roads and clinics . No . It has been in furnishing themselves with tunnels and buying and smuggling weapons so that they can go on their continued jihad against Israel . That will now be brought to an end.Hamas will be dismantled , and as our forces on the ground advance , we uncover what Hamas is leaving behind . We&rsquo;re documenting everything , and we&rsquo;re also sharing it with the world so that everyone can see where international aid has gone , where it was supposed to have gone above ground , and where it evidently ended up underground in the hands of Hamas.TML : This has been going on for years , the smuggling of weapons , but do you believe the international community actually believes that today ? You might be saying that here , and on many other international programs , yet public opinion doesn&rsquo;t necessarily say that they agree with the reality on the ground.Lt . - Col . Conricus : I think that the polling indicates not quite what you say because I see very solid support among [ the ] US population , lots of sympathy towards Israel , the Israeli government even , and definitely Israelis . And there&rsquo;s a distinction between those three.And I think , according to the polls that I&rsquo;ve seen , an overwhelming US majority , and I&rsquo;ve seen polls of Western countries as well , an overwhelming US majority supports Israel&rsquo;s quest to dismantle Hamas based on what they&rsquo;ve seen , what Hamas did on October 7th . The atrocities , the murder , rape , the brutal executions , and the burning of corpses and all of those atrocities Hamas did that seem distant now.It&rsquo;s been more than two months , but it&rsquo;s still very fresh in Israeli collective memory . People saw that , and people understand what monsters Israel is dealing with , and therefore people all around the world support Israel in our quest to defend ourselves . And I understand that there are certain elites , and there are editors and there are politicians and people for whom it doesn&rsquo;t fit with their worldview and agenda that Israel should be allowed to defend itself and to care for itself and for Israelis to live safely within their internationally recognized border without fear of being under persecution , rape and murder.But that&rsquo;s fine . They&rsquo;ll continue to harbor their negative views , and we&rsquo;ll continue to build our country , defend ourselves , and defeat our enemies as we have been doing since 1948.TML : The United States was very strong in supporting the Israel Defense Forces&rsquo ; actions in Gaza . There is a bit of a shift . You see President Biden putting on some very strong pushback at this point and he&rsquo;s saying that [ Israel ] has to pull back . He&rsquo;s telling everyone [ to ] wrap it up in some form . How is this going to impact what the IDF is going to do in the coming weeks ? What&rsquo;s the pressure point here?Lt . - Col . Conricus : I don&rsquo;t see one , and on the ground in the IDF that is not the perception that we have . What I see in news events and what I see the president saying is , I stand with Israel , and I support Israel , and Israel needs to get rid of Hamas . Those are clear words that I understand.I see a lot of journalists trying to corner the president and get other statements out of him , but I see a president steadfast in his support for Israel , unflinching and unmoving , and I think that is tremendous . That is the leadership that is so extremely important in times of war . And I see various other important American officials , including senior spokespeople like [ John ] Kirby taking a very clear moral position on what needs to be done , defeat Hamas , bring the hostages home , and do it in such a way that it minimizes collateral damage and damage to civilians , which is what we are doing.We do listen to what our allies and friends around the world are saying . We do take into account the criticism that is voiced , and we do try to adapt , where applicable , our tactics on the ground in order to accommodate that , and of course , we communicate what we are doing on the battlefield to the world , so that the world can see how we are fighting , and also , very importantly , what type of enemy we are fighting . How the enemy uses cynically the civilians at their so-to-say disposal that they have in Gaza because it&rsquo;s really how Hamas looks at civilian Palestinians.They think of them as something disposable that they can use , in order to get public opinion swayed against Israel and for Hamas , and in some cases , it works and some people are calling for cease-fire , and some people are adopting Hamas&rsquo ; talking points . I think that&rsquo;s very unfortunate , but at the end of the day , our resolve is very clear.We understand what needs to be done , and we also understand that really , frankly , we don&rsquo;t have a choice . If we do not defeat Hamas , our people , Israelis , cannot go back to live safely in their homes , and that is a result that is unacceptable . And therefore we will continue to fight until Hamas is defeated and our hostages returned.TML : There are still a lot of hostages left in Gaza . Are you closer to getting any of them out ? There were those in the IDF that attempted to bring two back ; they brought two hostage bodies back , and unfortunately others were killed . [ Former Chief of General Staff ] Gadi Eisenkot , his son was killed in that action . So what is it going to take ? Is it going to be a constant race to see how you are going to get the hostages out , and yet you might lose more men in doing so?Lt . - Col . Conricus : It is a tremendous challenge . A tactical challenge . It&rsquo;s a very difficult mission to deal with , because of how cynically Hamas is using the hostages as bargaining chips and as human shields . We have said very clearly from the beginning and continuously that we are going to spare no efforts in getting our hostages back , even if it means to conduct tactical operations which will put soldiers at risk . It is our commitment and our duty to bring our hostages back.If it can be done through diplomatic means , great . If it cannot be done through diplomatic means , then we will do it in any other way that is possible . At the end of the day , our moral and professional obligation is to bring our people back.TML : What are the numbers currently ? How many women are being held today in Gaza?Lt . - Col . Conricus : As far as I know , there are 135 Israelis still held in Gaza , out of which 17 are women and children.TML : Does that include the hostage body that just came back ? Is it down to 134?Lt . - Col . Conricus : I know 135 . That is the latest number I have based on the latest information.TML : Was it 16 in terms of women at this moment?Lt . - Col . Conricus : As far as I know , we are talking about 17 women and children . I could be mistaken by one . These are moving figures after all , but in any case , the very important thing is that Hamas , they themselves violated the agreement that they pushed so hard in order to achieve in return for a temporary cease-fire or a pause in operations.They were supposed to return 10 live Israeli civilians , women or children , every day . They failed to do so . They violated the terms of the agreement , and then they also started firing . And there is a lot of speculation as to why they did that . I&rsquo;m not going to speculate about it , but a lot has been said about it.But at the end of the day , contrary to Hamas claims , there are at least 17 women and children still held in Hamas captivity , 68 days after the war started.TML : The Wall Street Journal just came out with a story that you are flooding the tunnels . It&rsquo;s definitely something that has been discussed . Is there anything that you can share about this with the concerns that it can hurt the fresh water that the Gazans will need?Lt . - Col . Conricus : Yeah , you know Hamas has been digging tunnels for many years , and we have been developing different countermeasures and techniques in order to deal with tunnels , both those tunnels that were dug into Israel what we call terror tunnels in order to infiltrate into Israel , and also underground infrastructure that they have inside Gaza which is really the backbone of their combat network.I can&rsquo;t go into details . I can say that we are looking at different capabilities and different components . We want to turn the tunnels from an asset that Hamas has really to a liability and eventually to their graves , and that is our intention.We are taking everything into consideration . The location of Israelis who may be held captive in certain areas , and other considerations ; one of them you mentioned . But at the end of the day , these tunnels will hopefully be the undoing of Hamas.TML : Looking ahead , is it too early to look ahead for an end game ? Where will the Palestinian people be left ? How will the Israeli borders be secure ? There has to be a strategy that is being discussed at the moment.Lt . - Col . Conricus : I&rsquo;m sure there is . Yes , and it&rsquo;s an important part . The IDF is part of the discussions at the cabinet and government level . We voiced our input when asked , when solicited . And at the end of the day , the IDF will implement the directives given by the government.I hope , as an Israeli , that a good and long-term solution can be found , one that first and foremost ensures the security and the sense of security for Israeli civilians that hopefully soon will be able to go back to their homes , rebuild their communities . Despite the heavy losses that they&rsquo;ve sustained , despite the damage to their beautiful communities , they&rsquo;ll have the power , they&rsquo;ll find the power.And with the help of the state and other people who will be helping , also the resources in order to rebuild those communities , and hopefully make them grow beyond what they were before . That is really reliant first and foremost on security being available and stable for those civilians to feel safe in order to return there.And then I hope that the international community will see it fit to join in and help , for once fundamentally change the situation in Gaza . We will free Gaza of the terrorist organization that ruled with an iron fist , a heavy hand , over Gaza for the last 17 years , and that will be an opportunity for positive , more advanced forces in the region , for nations in the region to invest in what&rsquo;s happening and hopefully bring about a positive and sustainable future for Gaza.I care mostly about Israeli civilians and our security , but I also understand that if there&rsquo;s prosperity and stability and education for human values and perhaps even democracy on the other side of the border , that&rsquo;s probably a good thing for us as well . So I am hopeful that that will happen , and I&rsquo;m hopeful that there will be international partners who will see it fit to rise to the challenge and do something good for a change when it comes to Gaza.TML : What are the biggest obstacles that the IDF is facing now as they&rsquo;re trying to wrap up this war , particularly in the north?Lt . - Col . Conricus : Yeah , I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re quite there yet . Mentally , we are definitely not thinking about wrapping up . We are knee-deep in fighting , and there still is a lot of heavy lifting to be done . Hamas still has combat capabilities in southern Gaza and still needs to be eliminated.We still need to take out the leadership , their command and control , and to dismantle and take away their military and administrative and financial capabilities . So that&rsquo;s still ahead of us.In the north , if you&rsquo;re referring to Hizbullah , then there is also a very significant challenge . As I said before regarding Gaza , I think it&rsquo;s very clear that we cannot ask our civilians to return to their homes and to be at risk of reliving the atrocities of October the 7th that happened along the Gaza border . And that the security situation needs to change.The Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi said so very clearly when he spoke with local leaders . Before we ask you to go back , before we tell you that it&rsquo;s safe to go back , we will make sure that it&rsquo;s safe and that the situation on the ground will not go back to what it was on October the 7th.Obviously , the first choice that Israel [ can take ] , or the first option that we will entertain , is not the kinetic military violence one . But if we are left with no other choices , if diplomacy fails , and other options will fail , then of course Israel will have to deal with the situation and will have to deal with the presence of this Iranian proxy at our doorsteps hundreds of yards away from Israeli communities . That is unacceptable , and it will not be the reality after the war.Let&rsquo;s hope that people , nations , and institutions that have an interest in the safety of Israelis and the integrity of the state of Lebanon will intervene soon enough , so as to avoid unnecessary bloodshed and destruction and the horrors that a war between Israel and Hizbullah may entail.TML : Videos are circulating showing Hamas taking over humanitarian aid that&rsquo;s designated for their own people . What can you add to that in terms of what you&rsquo;re going through in trying to get people to the right places , suggesting where it might be a safe zone , and also the obstacles there in terms of getting humanitarian aid to the population?Lt . - Col . Conricus : Hamas colors are shining through , and it&rsquo;s another example of how they have absolutely no regard for Palestinian civilians . They are just using them as cannon fodder , as human shields , and as pawns in their political efforts against Israel . That&rsquo;s very cynical , but it&rsquo;s very obvious for anybody who is honest enough and can see.Yeah , so the true colors of Hamas are showing . It&rsquo;s evident that they absolutely have no regard for civilians , or Palestinian civilians . They continue to use them as their human shields and as expendable assets in their political game against Israel.We see them looting UNRWA warehouses . We see them taking over humanitarian trucks and convoys . We see them stealing fuel . We see them stealing food and medicine that is intended through the generous aid of the US and the help of Egypt and many other parts of the international community they are intended for good humanitarian purposes . And many around the world hope that it will get to their civilian addresses.But at the end of the day , Hamas has one goal . Their goal is jihad , holy war against Israel . They want to annihilate Israel . They want to do the October 7th massacre again and again and again , and for that aim they have no problem taking humanitarian aid , with stealing fuel , or with taking food that is intended for Palestinian children in hospitals in Gaza and bringing underground into their tunnels for their fighters to have instead of civilians . So it&rsquo;s abundantly clear.We&rsquo;ve been saying all along that Hamas abuses the civilian population . Our hope is that more and more people around the world will see reality and acknowledge the fact that Hamas is violating everything that is supposed to be holy , and any of the basic tenets of humanity . They are committing crimes against humanity on a daily basis.And I hope , really hope , that [ the ] UN and other humanitarian organizations will finally come around and speak the truth about what&rsquo;s happening in Gaza and call Hamas out for what it is : a terrorist organization that brutally abuses the civilian population . And it is about high time that UNRWA and other organizations call [ out ] Hamas for what it is and start helping us save Palestinians from the horrors of warfare and get them out of the battle zone , provide them with international humanitarian aid , and make sure that it doesn&rsquo;t go into the wrong hands of Hamas.TML : The clock is ticking , and the families of the hostages are deeply concerned that they may not see their loved ones . It&rsquo;s a big difficulty for the Israel Defense Forces , especially now when you are pushing forward with possibly flooding tunnels . What do you do ? How do you secure those hostages at this moment?Lt . - Col . Conricus : As I said , it&rsquo;s a very very sensitive topic , and an extremely complex and very challenging mission . Because of the sensitivity , I can&rsquo;t go into the exact details of the tactics of it . What I can say is that it is a top priority of the IDF to get all of the hostages back . We spare no efforts [ in ] intelligence , manpower , [ and ] resources in locating the hostages and trying to bring them home.Unfortunately , one effort that we conducted a few days ago ended with us only being able to return the bodies of hostages , but we will continue to collect intelligence , devise plans , and where feasible , execute plans in order to get the people back.We are aware of the situation , and I think that one thing that should be said is that for 68 days these Israelis have been held in inhumane conditions and the Red Cross has not yet found the ability or the political will to actually go implement their mandate and visit these hostages . Many of them [ are ] women , children and civilians , but soldiers have rights as well under the Geneva Conventions . All of them are entitled to a visit by the Red Cross to make sure that they are receiving medical help , that they are safe , and that their basic needs are taken care of.That is what&rsquo;s supposed to happen . Sadly , it has not yet happened , and it wouldn&rsquo;t be a minute too soon once the Red Cross actually gets access and implements its mandate.TML : Lt . - Col . Jonathan Conricus , international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces , thank you for your time . And I wish you strength.Lt . - Col . Conricus : Thank you . Thank you , Felice .","gaza war must dismantle hamas , tunnel flooding on table - idf spokesperson"

Yesh Atid led by Yair Lapid would receive 15 seats . Yisrael Beytenu led by Avigdor Liberman strength in the Knesset would grow to 11 seats , while J Otzma Yehudit led by Itamar Ben Gvir would receive 9 seats.Shas led by Arye Deri would win 8 seats , while the Religious Zionist Party led by Bezalel Smotrich , and United Torah Judaism led by Yitzhak Goldknopf each would gain 7 seats . Hadash-Ta&rsquo;al led by Ayman Odeh wins 5 seats , and Ra'am led by Mansour Abbas garners 4 seats.N13 report further claims that in contrast to previous surveys , the Labor Party - which has not yet elected a new leader - would win 4 seats , while the Meretz , New Hope which is led by Gideon Sa&rsquo;ar , and Balad parties would not pass the electoral threshold.The & nbsp ; & ldquo;Change Government&rdquo ; parties collectively receive 64 seats , the N13 report states . Meanwhile , the Netanyahu Bloc strengthens compared to previous surveys , amassing 51 seats .

2024-04-21 00:19:33.920,jpost,"On March 22 , Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced that Israel would be taking control of 10 km . of land previously not under its authority in the West Bank & ndash ; the disputed territory the world calls the & ldquo;West Bank . & rdquo;Smotrich announced , & ldquo;While there are those in Israel and the world who seek to undermine our right over the the West Bank area and the country in general , we are promoting settlement through hard work and in a strategic manner all over the country . & rdquo;This announcement largely escaped mainstream and even Israeli media but was highlighted by Arab media outlets around the world.As The Washington Post reported , & ldquo;If Israel confiscates land around Jerusalem , all the way to the Dead Sea , there will be no future for a Palestinian capital in east Jerusalem , & rdquo ; said Hamza Zubiedat , a land rights activist for the Ramallah-based Ma&rsquo;an Development Center . & ldquo;This is where a Palestinian capital was supposed to be located , according to the American and European talks . & rdquo ; While Zubiedat&rsquo;s reaction wasn&rsquo;t factually accurate , it speaks to the Palestinian objection to Israeli expansion in the West Bank.The American government strongly objects to Israeli building in the West Bank.American long-held policy was not to state an opinion on the legality of Israeli settlements in the West Bank.Former president Donald Trump changed American policy , maintaining that settlements weren&rsquo;t inconsistent with international law . Current US Secretary of State Antony Blinken reversed American policy and declared that Israeli settlements are inconsistent with international law . Secretary Blinken recently said , & ldquo;Our administration maintains a firm opposition to settlement expansion , and in our judgment , this only weakens & ndash ; and doesn&rsquo;t strengthen & ndash ; Israel&rsquo;s security . & rdquo;Settlement legitimacyThe Israeli government maintains that settlement building is legal and encouraged . Israeli prime ministers from the Left , including David Ben-Gurion and Yitzhak Rabin , to the Right , including Menachem Begin and Benjamin Netanyahu , considered the West Bank historic Jewish land . It is as much part of the land of Israel as Tel Aviv and Netanya & ndash ; if not even more.the West Bank are considered the heartland of historic Israel . Israel&rsquo;s long history on the land , its intrinsic connection to the region , and the absurdity of claiming that Jews are prohibited to live somewhere simply because they&rsquo;re Jews , lends legitimacy to Israeli expansion of settlements . No excuse nor justification needs to be given for Israeli settlements , just as none is given in response to Arabs who claim Jews can&rsquo;t live in Jaffa or Tel Aviv.The US government and the European Union ( EU ) see a larger issue in rebuilding settlements than international law . The Americans believe the only solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the two-state solution . This plan envisions an Israeli and a Palestinian state living side by side , in peace . Settlements are built on the land the global community envision being a Palestinian state . In their estimation , Jewish settlements forestall , and could eventually end the possibility of implementing the two state solution . Many accuse Israel of building settlements specifically to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.In 1937 , the British Peel Commission offered a two-state solution , and the Arabs rejected the idea . The Arabs did so again in 1947 with the United Nations Partition Plan . In subsequent years , the Palestinians rejected countless offers of autonomy or statehood if they would end the conflict by signing a peace deal with Israel.Never ones to miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity , the Palestinians have rejected every peace deal offered by Israel.They have had plenty of chances to establish an independent Palestinian state , but their intransigence has prevented it . It seems the Palestinians aren&rsquo;t interested in their own state alongside a Jewish state , they prefer a Palestinian state that takes the place of the Jewish state.Palestinian inflexibility isn&rsquo;t the only problem plaguing the two-state solution . Not only do Palestinians refuse to negotiate peace with Israel , but they also utilize terrorism as a method of obtaining their political objectives.Contrary to a narrative popularly pushed by Western leaders and media , Palestinian terrorism isn&rsquo;t just conducted by the extremists in Palestinian society . Terrorism has the support of Palestinian leadership and the people . Leaders incentivize terrorism through programs like & ldquo;pay for slay&rdquo ; ; teachers encourage violence by using examples of terrorism in their classrooms ; and society as a whole sends a clear message by naming streets , schools , and municipal buildings after terrorists.Palestinians expect the world to cater to their demands , reverse 75 years of history , and create a Palestinian state along the borders the United Nations set in 1947 . They imagine they can refuse to negotiate for peace and move to terrorism and there won&rsquo;t be any consequences to their position . Their assumptions are irrational and unrealistic . The Palestinians have had multiple opportunities to create an independent state for themselves and have passed up on each and every opportunity for peace . Their rejectionism has consequences.It is time the world addressed Palestinians honestly . Instead of talking about a two-state solution and a & ldquo;revamped&rdquo ; Palestinian Authority , it&rsquo;s time the world told Palestinians they have given up the chance of a state.Their adoration of death , violence , and terrorism has defeated their aspirations for an independent state . They must give up their insistence on a state & ldquo;From the river to the sea , & rdquo ; and even in parts of it , and work towards a peaceful negotiated settlement with Israel . Further terrorism and intransigence will only make life worse for them , going forward.Until the world is ready to have this honest conversation with the Palestinians , they will continue to hold onto their unrealistic demands and increase their terrorism.The writer is a certified interfaith hospice chaplain in Jerusalem and the mayor of Mitzpe Yeriho , Israel .

2021-05-20 02:57:57.157,jpost,"The term & ldquo;pogrom&rdquo ; is unfortunately back in our lexicon . & nbsp ; Last week , Israeli President Reuven Rivlin described attacks by & ldquo;a bloodthirsty Arab mob&rdquo ; in the mixed Jewish-Arab city of Lod as a & ldquo;pogrom . & rdquo ; A Jewish vigilante in Lod told The Washington Post that he was defending its Jewish residents & ldquo;from a pogrom . & rdquo ; On the other side , when a video captured Jewish rioters beating what they took to be an Arab man in Bat Yam , a Pakistani writer tweeted , & ldquo;This is what a pogrom looks like . & rdquo ; So what exactly is a pogrom ? And are Jews the inevitable , exclusive victims ? It&rsquo;s been over a century since the Russian word & ldquo;pogrom&rdquo ; entered the English language , but the civil unrest in Israel is unfortunately bringing the term back into current usage . The New York Times , using the Yiddish plural & ldquo;pogromen , & rdquo ; & nbsp;first cited the term in 1882 to describe the wave of anti-Jewish violence that followed the assassination of Czar Alexander II , and provided a helpful inline definition : & ldquo;riots against the Jews . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Slavic root of the term , derived from the evocative word & ldquo;to thunder , & rdquo ; adds tone but otherwise gives little indication of its meaning . Pogrom was one of many words , including & ldquo;riot , & rdquo ; & ldquo;upheaval&rdquo ; and & ldquo;disorderly conduct , & rdquo ; used to describe the horrific attacks that plagued Jewish villages in the Russian Empire from 1881 to 1884 as transient Russian workers rode the rails from shtetl to shtetl , stopping at every station to beat , rape and occasionally murder . & nbsp ; In the wake of the violence , some 1.75 million Eastern European Jews migrated to the United States , the numbers tapering off only in the 1920s when restrictive immigration quotas were imposed . The term pogrom migrated with them , from Russian to Yiddish to English . In the late 19th century , many Jewish activists believed that Alexander III , the new czar , had given his blessing to the pogroms by directing police to turn a blind eye to the violence . This view was famously captured in Sholom Aleichem&rsquo;s writings and in the musical & ldquo;Fiddler on the Roof , & rdquo ; based on his stories , when the local police chief lets Tevye in on the secret plans for an upcoming pogrom . & nbsp ; Toward the end of the 20th century , archival research led historians to dismiss that interpretation of the pogroms . & nbsp;The 1881-1884 pogroms were not organized by the bureaucratically inept Russian government , which viewed the uncontrollable violence as a threat to the stability of the regime as a whole . & nbsp ; By contrast , the far more brutal pogroms of the 20th century , including the notorious Kishinev pogrom of 1903 and the bloody pogroms that engulfed Ukraine during the chaos that followed World War I , showed much clearer signs of coordination by authorities at various levels . The last czar , Nicholas II , tacitly encouraged the violence by openly supporting the violent Black Hundreds organization and even underwriting the publication of the antisemitic work & ldquo;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion . & rdquo ; The definition of the word pogrom thus has come to include three essential elements : a violent mob , Jewish victimhood and at least the appearance of some level of central planning or incitement , although the attacks themselves seem more spontaneous . & nbsp ; Although the word pogrom first emerged in the late 19th century , it was later applied anachronistically to incidents in the distant past . Social upheavals directed against Jews are virtually as old as Jewish history itself , with the street violence of Alexandria , Egypt , in the year 38 C.E . considered the earliest example . & nbsp ; Throughout the medieval period , a combination of religious fervor and bloodlust motivated ordinary citizens to rise up and attack Jews in hundreds of crusades , blood libels and false charges of host desecration , often with the tacit or explicit approval of ruling authorities . & nbsp ; The term pogrom is rarely used to describe the events of the Holocaust , on quantitative and qualitative grounds : The Nazis murdered millions in a hierarchical , organized and bureaucratic manner unlike the erratic and spontaneous attacks by pogromists . Nevertheless , certain specific incidents from World War II might qualify , such as the notorious Petliura Days of Lviv or the massacres of the Jews of Jedwabne . Kristallnacht , the & ldquo;night of broken glass&rdquo ; that presaged the genocide , is often described as a pogrom . The word may be borrowed for other purposes & mdash ; the authoritative Oxford English Dictionary relates a few citations & mdash ; but they often sound wrong , like dark examples of cultural appropriation . Non-Jewish populations often suffered very similar attacks & mdash ; Mennonites were horribly brutalized by anarchist bands in Ukraine , for example , and their woes compounded by deeply held pacifist beliefs that prevented self-defense & mdash ; but pogrom is deeply rooted in Jewish history and narrative , no less than & ldquo;intifada&rdquo ; is rooted in the Palestinian narrative . Two of the classic elements of the historical pogrom are sadly present in the streets of some Israeli cities , namely mob violence and Jewish victims . The appearance of central planning , however , is hard to identify , and the term doesn&rsquo;t account for the fact that the government and law enforcement are predisposed to defend Israel&rsquo;s Jewish citizens . Historically , pogroms are synonymous with Jewish powerlessness . Is it possible to speak of a pogrom when the state authorities responsible for maintaining public order are Jewish ? & nbsp ; As for the use of the term pogrom by the pro-Palestinian side : Is that a fair label , with its ironic connotation that the former victims of pogroms have become its perpetrators ? Or a foul appropriation meant to erase Jewish history and & ldquo;flip the script&rdquo ; ? & nbsp ; The debate is similar to the ones over how to describe urban unrest in this country : Are they & ldquo;race riots&rdquo ; ? & ldquo;Rebellions&rdquo ; ? & ldquo;Police riots&rdquo ; ? & ldquo;Uprisings&rdquo ; ? & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Perhaps none of this discussion is helpful from a practical standpoint . When neighbors rise up and physically assault each other , especially after decades of peaceful coexistence , perhaps it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what term we use to describe the violence . But the language we use shapes our response to a crisis & mdash ; words matter . From the standpoint of history , naming the violence a pogrom , a riot or an intifada will have implications for how the State of Israel chooses to contain the threat .

2022-12-18 15:58:41.817,jpost,"Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) leaders have called for stepping up attacks against Israel , especially in the West Bank.The call was made during a meeting in Beirut between Saleh al-Arouri , deputy chairman of the Hamas Politburo , and PIJ Secretary-General Ziyad al-Nakhaleh.The meeting took place on Saturday night and was attended by several representatives of the two Iranian-backed Islamist groups.It took place amid mounting violence in the West Bank and a Palestinian Authority security crackdown on members of the two groups.It also came ahead of the formation of a new Israeli governing coalition headed by Prime Minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu . & ldquo;The two sides affirmed the joint cooperation in strengthening and activating the resistance of our people in all of Palestine in the face of the Israeli occupation and criminality , & rdquo ; Hamas said in a statement after the meeting . & ldquo;They also emphasized the importance of rallying around the resistance in all its forms . & rdquo;Resistance and confrontation&nbsp;Hamas and PIJ use the term & ldquo;resistance&rdquo ; to refer to the use of violence and armed attacks against Israel.Hamas said the two sides stressed the importance of & ldquo;confronting Zionist schemes that aim to undermine the resistance and liquidate the Palestinian cause . & rdquo;Meanwhile , Abu Obeida , spokesman for Izzadin al-Qassam , the so-called military wing of Hamas , on Sunday hinted that his group was planning to kidnap IDF soldiers . & ldquo;The decision to increase the number of soldiers held by the Izzadin al-Qassam Brigades remains effective and is being carried out , & rdquo ; he said in an interview with a Hamas-affiliated website to mark the 35tth anniversary of the founding of Hamas.He was referring to the remains of IDF soldiers Hadar Goldin and Oron Shaul , who were killed during the 2014 Israel-Hamas war . & ldquo;The [ Israeli ] enemy will regret its intransigence regarding a new prisoner-exchange deal , & rdquo ; he said , regarding Israel&rsquo;s alleged refusal to release thousands of Palestinian security prisoners held in Israeli jails in return for the bodies of the soldiers.Two Israeli civilians who reportedly entered the Gaza Strip on their own , Hisham al-Sayed and Avera Mengistu , are also being held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.Last week , Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar said his group would give Israel & ldquo;a limited time to complete the [ prisoner-exchange ] deal . & rdquo ; Otherwise , Hamas & ldquo;will close the file of the four enemy prisoners forever and find another way to liberate our prisoners , & rdquo ; he said in a speech to mark the Hamas anniversary.Abu Obeidah said in the interview that the Izzadin al-Qassam Brigades & ldquo;forms the nucleus of the Palestinian Liberation Army . & rdquo;The rising tensions and violence in the West Bank was the most significant action in the past 15 years and would have & ldquo;strategic consequences on the future of the Zionist entity , & rdquo ; he said.Addressing the Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem , Abu Obeidah urged them to & ldquo;continue escalating the resistance because we are facing an existential battle . & rdquo;In a related development , a committee representing several Palestinian factions in the West Bank on Sunday called on Palestinians to & ldquo;target the settlements with all available means and tools&rdquo ; until the settlers no longer feel safe and leave the Palestinian territories . & nbsp ;","hamas , islamic jihad call to step up ‘ resistance ’ attacks against israel"
2021-02-18 18:13:54.497,jpost,"& nbsp;The Supreme Court has ordered World Vision Operations Manager Mohammad El Halabi to remain in detention until at least May 19 , pending the verdict in his trial on charges of assisting Hamas on a variety of fronts . & nbsp ; In a Tuesday decision only now being reported , Justice Menachem Mazuz said that Halabi both posed a danger and was a flight risk , which , along with the case moving toward a conclusion , meant the courts should not release him to house arrest . & nbsp ; With four-and-half-years having passed since Halabi was indicted in the Beersheba District Court , it is still unclear when there will be a verdict about whether he was a humanitarian who has been unfairly targeted or working with Hamas or both . & nbsp ; Updates from Halabi&rsquo;s lawyer , Maher Hana , and the Justice Ministry have indicated that closing arguments were scheduled for March 3 . & nbsp ; However , Hana argued to Mazuz that the closing arguments and the district court&rsquo;s deliberation and composing of the verdict could still see Halabi held in detention far beyond May 19 . & nbsp ; Supporters of Halabi have also said that the prosecution at earlier stages in the case had offered a three year jail sentence as part of a plea bargain . & nbsp ; In that light , Halabi having to serve already five years and remain in prison for a continued indefinite period would make little sense since even a conviction could lead to his release based on time already served . & nbsp ; Mazuz responded saying that motions filed by Hana had caused many of the delays since the prosecution concluded its case back in April 2018 . & nbsp ; The Supreme Court justice also said that the trial had been robust including the calling of over 40 witnesses and a mini-trial on aspects of the evidence . & nbsp ; Halabi was indicted in August 2016 for allegedly using World Vision as a front for smuggling $ 7.2 million a year to Hamas for buying weapons and building attack tunnels . & nbsp ; This was instead of being used by the humanitarian organization for food , humanitarian assistance , and aid programs for disabled children as earmarked . & nbsp ; The indictment said that World Vision operated in 100 countries and employed 46,000 people , but had fallen victim to a complex Hamas takeover scheme led by Halabi . & nbsp ; At the time , World Vision denied the allegations and said it was & ldquo;shocked&rdquo ; since it had regular internal and independent audits and evaluations as well as a broad range of internal controls to ensure aid reached intended beneficiaries . & nbsp ; NGO Monitor has filed detailed reports to critique these audits as inadequate and for avoiding asking tougher questions about dual use items which could look innocent on paper , but which could be used by Hamas . & nbsp ; Eventually , Australia , which was funding the World Vision Gaza project , cut its funding , though an audit its government performed did not find the wrongdoing allegedly uncovered by the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) . & nbsp ; Despite being indicted in August 2016 , it is still unclear when there will be a verdict from the Beersheba District Court . & nbsp ; In addition , the legal proceedings themselves have been rife with irregularities in restricting evidence and how Halabi&rsquo;s lawyer maintains information he learns during the closed proceedings much more typical of Israel&rsquo;s military courts than what is typical in Israeli civilian courts . & nbsp ; In April 2018 and again in July 2020 , the High Court of Justice rejected Hana&rsquo;s request to intervene in the case to compel the prosecution to play by more standard civilian court rules .",supreme court orders halabi to remain in detention pending trial verdict
2024-03-18 18:54:20.460,jpost,"The decrease in the IDF&rsquo;s pace and pressure in its operations is lengthening the conflict in the North and negatively affecting Israel&rsquo;s international standing , Minister Gideon Sa&rsquo;ar said Monday.According to Sa&rsquo;ar , the fact that the main decisions about the war are being made in the small war cabinet instead of the statutory national security cabinet is problematic , and he repeated his demand to become a part of the smaller cabinet as well.Sa&rsquo;ar , the New Hope & ndash ; The United Right chairman and minister-without-portfolio made the comments during a press conference ahead of his party&rsquo;s first official meeting after splitting from National Unity last week.Sa&rsquo;ar claimed that when National Unity first joined the government , he was supposed to have been appointed to the cabinet , but he agreed that National Unity Minister-without-Portfolio Gadi Eisenkot , a former IDF chief of staff , take his spot . & ldquo;But we should have already been in a different place , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar said . & ldquo;We need to act at a faster pace , with more forces . We need to increase the military pressure on Hamas , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar said.He also argued that the destruction of Hamas&rsquo;s ruling capabilities was not proceeding as planned . & ldquo;Hamas&rsquo;s takeover of humanitarian aid meant for civilians strengthens it , and undermines the goal , & rdquo ; Sa&rsquo;ar said.Threats to quit governmentSa&rsquo;ar also repeated a statement from earlier this week , that if he is not given a seat in the war cabinet , his party will quit the government . Even if it does , it will not call for an election , according to a clarification by Sa&rsquo;ar&rsquo;s spokesperson.A number of other party leaders held their own press conferences on Monday ahead of their parties&rsquo ; weekly meetings.Opposition leader and Yesh Atid chairman MK Yair Lapid criticized what he claimed was the coalition&rsquo;s & ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo ; attempt to wiggle its way out of a decision to draft haredi ( ultra-Orthodox ) men into the IDF to fill ranks of casualties and meet Israel&rsquo;s heightened security needs . & ldquo;The fact that they again are making up tricks and finagles and delays is not just an affront to our soldiers , it endangers the State of Israel , & rdquo ; Lapid said . The Supreme Court on Sunday gave the government a small extension to March 27 to deliver its response as to why it was not drafting haredi men after the law that enabled the exemption expired last June . & ldquo;If they care about security , they need to tell the haredi parties : & lsquo;Friends , there are no more games . You need to internalize that you are done getting without giving . Whoever does not enlist will not receive even one worn-out agora [ a 100th of a shekel ] , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; Lapid added.Yisrael Beytenu head Avigdor Liberman said it was no longer possible to talk about quotas for haredi men to enlist in the IDF every year , and that it was time for a law that every 18-year-old will serve for three years , after which & ldquo;they will do whatever they want , & rdquo ; Liberman said.Talks between haredi parties , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Defense Minister Yoav Gallant , and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich have been ongoing over the past few weeks to find a way to solve the current haredi draft crisis.The crisis began after the government last month announced its plan to extend mandatory and reserve duties for current soldiers , but without recruiting soldiers from a broader pool of candidates , such as haredim , to lessen the burden on those who already are serving.The crisis also coincided with a court case against the haredi exemption that is currently underway in the Supreme Court . The previous law that enabled haredi exemption officially expired at the end of June 2023 , and the government decided that it would pass a new law by the end of March 2024.However , with that date nearing , the government does not seem close to solving the issue , and it is likely to request other extensions until the end of June . Government funding for yeshiva students also stems from the law that expired , and thus if no solution is found on time , haredi men may no longer be legally entitled to an exemption , and yeshivot may lose their funding.Israel Hayom reported on Monday evening that one of the possible solutions was to raise the age of exemption for haredi men from its current 26 to somewhere between 35 and 40 . This means that haredi men who leave their yeshiva before that age would need to serve in the IDF.The idea is that this will allow whoever wants to study full time to continue doing so , but on the other hand , it will disincentivize haredim who are not interested in studying from using their yeshiva student status as a cover to avoid IDF service . Haredi men who are yeshiva students cannot legally work.Some ministers , such as Smotrich , thought prior to October 7 that the age of exemption should be lowered to as low as 21 to enable haredi men to join the workforce earlier without having to do IDF service first . The new idea to do the opposite and actually increase the age of exemption would be a significant conceptual shift .",sa'ar holds first party meeting after break off from gantz

Unfortunately , the prime minister's answer was to remove him from the cabinet . We are arguing among ourselves over a deal that does not exist . I think we need to understand and realize that Hamas is an organization that should not exist and has no interest in releasing them . We are obliged to return them all , including Hadar Goldin , who has been there for a long time . We need to focus on our goals , and at the top of the list is to return the hostages .

Again , the hostages can only be returned through military action . We won't stand for a government that will surrender and allow Hamas to continue to rule . "" Regarding the northern sector , Kreuzer added : "" I think that the same concept that brought us to October 7 in the Gaza Strip outlines the policy in the North .

"" I was still here when the Knesset enacted time and time again this and other amendments to the draft law .

2023-11-17 17:55:58.697,jpost,"The recent announcement about the discovery of an explosives laboratory in the Shuafat refugee camp did not surprise residents of Pisgat Ze’ev . They are used to the sounds of explosions and automatic weapons for years and have even become accustomed to collecting the bullet casings from the children’s trampolines.This is what neighborhood resident and journalist Uri Rodriguez Garcia wrote this week , with more than a hint of bitterness . However , starting on October 7 , what was almost background noise that many have become used to has turned into a real state of war.Crisis in Pisgat Ze'ev : Fears of Palestinian attack post-October 7Yael Entebi , a long-time resident and candidate for city council ( although municipal elections have been temporarily postponed due to the war ) , said that the craziest thing about this situation is that it is not an area in the territories and not in Gaza – but here , in Jerusalem , the capital of Israel.Recently , parents of children who participate in sports classes in a facility located next to the security fence asked authorities to provide solutions to the dangerous situation before a disaster occurs . Parents who attend evening classes at the Teddy Kollek School , near the security fence , are demanding that armed guards be stationed there . So far , the municipality has authorized increased patrols in the area , but that solution hasn’t calmed the parents.In fact , tensions rose after dozens of Palestinians tried to cross the security fence and were stopped only after police were called . As a result , parents of the children who participate in the afternoon and evening classes at the Teddy Kollek School say that their children’s safety is being neglected and are refusing to continue “ business as usual . ” “ There is no security and no lighting . It’s 200 meters from the seam line . It’s really scary , ” said one parent , adding that the school , about 200 m . from the Hizmeh checkpoint , is only a five-minute walk . “ The road from the parking lot to the sports hall is very dark , there is no lighting , and small children [ who go there ] are afraid to attend . ” As of this week , a security squad has started to operate in Pisgat Ze’ev , as well as in 10 other neighborhoods . “ That is very good , ” affirmed Antebi , “ but it is far from being enough . Our houses are a few meters away from these Arab neighborhoods built after the security fence was erected . These are areas rife with crime , the weapons there are in everyone’s hands , and they shoot indiscriminately . “ The Palestinians who moved there because of the affordable and new construction [ are now fleeing ] from there for their lives and returning to live in the east of the city as much as possible . ” Antebi observed that the lack of security in the neighborhood has been increasing , and did not start with October 7.In response to the community’s concerns , the Jerusalem Municipality stated : “ Pisgat Ze’ev’s community administration holds classes subject to the instructions of the Home Front Command , according to which holding an activity does not require the posting of a guard or security . “ At the same time , the community administration team asked the Home Front Command soldiers to conduct patrols in the afternoon and evening , with an emphasis on the sports halls and places where classes are held . As for the lighting in the area , the issue will be examined and addressed . ” In the wake of riots and serious disturbances that have taken place recently a few hundred meters away from houses on the perimeter of the community , near the security fence , the Jerusalem District Police announced last week that several security measures will be implemented in the neighborhood to ensure the security of the residents . These will include increased patrols around the security fence . Security forces will also employ all existing means to disperse disturbances , and will act against those who try to breach the security fence.PISGAT ZE’EV is a Jewish neighborhood in northeast Jerusalem , adjacent to Neveh Ya’acov . It has a mixed population of haredi , National Religious , and secular Jews . It is divided into five areas : central , north , south , east , and west , and is one of the ring neighborhoods around Jerusalem . As of May 2022 , approximately 45,100 residents live there ; it is one of the largest neighborhoods in Jerusalem . Named after Zionist-Revisionist leader Ze’ev Jabotinsky , Pizgat Ze’ev was established on territories beyond the Green Line that have been effectively annexed to Israel after the 1967 Six Day War.The main idea behind the establishment of the neighborhood was to create a Jewish urban continuum between French Hill and the Neveh Ya’acov neighborhood , which until then had been cut off from Jerusalem in terms of urban continuity . Land designated for the establishment of the neighborhood was expropriated in early 1980 , after a long delay by the Finance Ministry , which feared the high cost compensating some Jews who owned land there in the 1930s . In fact , part of the neighborhood was owned by Jews who perished in the Holocaust , and the heirs of three of them were aware of the purchase and received compensation for it at the time . The remaining Jewish owners died without leaving heirs , or their heirs are unaware of their right to the land . The Ministerial Committee for Jerusalem Affairs made the official decision to establish the neighborhood on December 3 , 1980 , with the urban planning assigned to landscape architect Zvi Dekel . The construction of the neighborhood began in 1982 , and the first houses were inhabited in 1985 . In 2007 , Arab families began moving into Pisgat Ze’ev , with estimates of 1,500 Arabs living there now . In 2009 , a group of rabbis called for a boycott of Jewish residents who were selling or renting apartments to Arabs ; however , the boycott did not occur . Since 2010 , ultra-Orthodox families began to settle there as a bridge to nearby Neveh Ya’acov . Many moved to Pisgat Ze’ev north and central Pisgat Ze’ev , which had a mix of National Religious and secular Jews from the outset . Pisgat Ze’ev east , Pisgat Ze’ev west , and Pisgat Ze’ev south are still mostly populated by National Religious and secular Jews , primarily young families . ❖",jerusalem residents decry lax security over fears of palestinian terror
2024-04-04 17:38:02.933,jpost,"National Unity chairman Benny Gantz&rsquo;s call for a national election in September was the first time he specified a time for it since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war on October 7 . He attributed his decision to the uptick in the intensity and volume of protests against the government over the past week . What Israel needed was & ldquo;quiet in the ballot box instead of flames in the streets , & rdquo ; he said.This argument is diametrically opposed to that of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who warned in a press conference on Sunday night that an election would create divisiveness and play into the hands of Hamas . An election was a bad idea when we are a & ldquo;step away from victory , & rdquo ; he said.This was somewhat contradictory to a comment made earlier in his speech , however , when he said a humanitarian and then military operation in Rafah would & ldquo;take time&rdquo ; and that there was & ldquo;no victory without entering Rafah , & rdquo ; implying that victory was not immediately at hand.Either way , ironically , an election could actually ease the way forward to ending the war in Gaza with a hostage deal and a governing alternative to Hamas.Formally , Israel heads to an election either when the prime minister resigns or when the Knesset passes a bill to disperse itself . Once this happens , the government becomes a caretaker government and remains in power until the next government takes over.Caretaker governments are not supposed to make far-reaching decisions . Still , they are not defined in law , and a number of significant moves were indeed made under them , including former prime minister Yair Lapid&rsquo;s maritime border agreement with Lebanon in 2022.As long as Netanyahu&rsquo;s government relies on its far-right parties , the Religious Zionist Party and Otzma Yehudit , he will be limited in the concessions he is willing to make on a hostage deal and the future of Gaza . With the Knesset officially disbanded , however , the far-right parties lose their leverage ; they cannot threaten to bring down the government since it has already fallen.This could pave the way for an ad-hoc coalition of at least some of the remaining Jewish parties , including those currently in the opposition , to move forward . According to a National Unity Party spokesperson , Gantz&rsquo;s call for an election&mdash;along with several policy arguments regarding a hostage deal , the security situation in the North , and the possibility of normalizing ties with Saudi Arabia&mdash;was intended to point to & ldquo;where we are headed . & rdquo;Netanyahu has hesitated to state a clear policy on what the end of the war will look like . Still , he has insisted time again that its three goals & ndash ; defeating Hamas , freeing the hostages , and ensuring that Gaza will never again be a security threat to Israel & ndash ; will be attained . If he concludes that these cannot be achieved within a reasonable time due to the far-right parties , disbanding the government may actually enable him to do so.Of course , this would be a political gamble , which Netanyahu is famous for avoiding . He would be ferociously attacked by the parties to his right and would likely lose votes to those parties . It also is not optimal from a democratic standpoint because governments should not take advantage of their caretaker status to implement policy.But if the prime minister comes to the realization that an election in the coming year is unavoidable , he may benefit from being the one to initiate it , portraying himself as the responsible adult who is attentive to public sentiment.The Likud , as it usually does , attacked Gantz in response and accused him of engaging in & ldquo;petty politics . & rdquo;With Gantz making the first move , there may come a time in the coming months when Netanyahu realizes that Gantz has a point and makes a move himself .",why did benny gantz call for an election - and how will netanyahu respond ? - analysis
2022-09-22 18:23:40.003,jpost,"The family of slain journalist Shireen Abu Akleh submitted a formal complaint with the International Criminal Court asking the international community to investigate the journalist's death , they announced in a statement on Tuesday.The Abu Akleh family accussed Israeli soldiers of deliberately targeting Shireen and another Al Jazeera journalist , citing new footage released that day by the Palestinian NGO Al Haq and Forensic Architecture . & nbsp;What do we know about Shireen Abu Akleh's death so far ? & nbsp;The investigation claimed to have created a visual approximation of what an Israeli marksman that may have shot Abu Akleh would have seen from a suspected firing position . The recreation shows a blue vested individual with the barely legible text "" press "" on the plate carrier . The investigators alleged that this proved that the soldier knowingly shot at a civilian to kill . & nbsp ; "" The evidence is overwhelming . It's been over four months since Shireen was killed , "" the family said in a statement . "" Our family shouldn't have to wait another day for justice . "" "" The evidence is overwhelming . It's been over four months since Shireen was killed . Our family shouldn't have to wait another day for justice . "" Shireen Abu Aklehs familyThe request for an ICC investigation comes in tandem with a call for an independent American investigation , which the family said it would continue to demand . "" The US still has an obligation to investigate and take meaningful action for one of their own citizens . But when an individual state fails to protect its own citizens , it's the responsibility of the international community to protect them instead.On July 4 , the bullet & mdash ; that killed Abu Akleh during a May 11 Israeli-Palestinian Jenin firefight & mdash ; was tested by a third party and overseen by the US Security Coordinator . While the test was inconclusive due to the damage to the projectile , the US State Department spokesman Ned Price released a statement saying that Israeli fire had likely killed the journalist.White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre assured on September 6 that there would be accountability for the death , but didn't specify what this entailed . The following day , brief controversy ensued in Israel when deputy State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said that the US would press Israel to review its policies , practices , and rules of engagement . & nbsp;This was dismissed by Israeli leaders as detached from the realities of combat on the ground . At The Jerusalem Post Annual Conference in New York in mid-September , US Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides said that Israel can decide for itself regarding its rules of engagement . "" It's obvious that Israeli war criminals cannot investigate their own crimes , "" said the Abu Akleh family on Tuesday . "" There must be consequences when a military kills civilians & mdash ; if not , it affords Israel's military , and any other military , the impunity to do this once again .

"" Shireen Abu Aklehs familyIsrael's own investigation into the incident ended on September 5 , concluding that it was likely that an IDF soldier fired the killing bullet . However , the military also dismissed the need for a criminal problem , since it would not have been a deliberate action . & nbsp ; & ldquo;There is a high possibility that Shireen was accidentally hit by IDF gunfire that was fired toward suspects identified as armed Palestinian gunmen , during an exchange of fire in which life-risking , widespread and indiscriminate shots were fired toward IDF soldiers , & rdquo ; the IDF Spokesperson&rsquo;s Unit said . "" Another possibility remains that Abu Akleh was hit by bullets fired by Palestinian militants . "" The Abu Akleh family has been highly critical of the US and Israel throughout the investigation process , and the claim that the IDF deliberately killed the journalist far predates Tuesday's statement and the new Al Haq-Forensic Architecture investigation.Al-Haq is one of the six Palestinian NGOs designated by Israel as a front for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization .

2022-02-15 19:26:08.037,jpost,"A range of moves by the government have led to the seizure of NIS 103 million of Hamas terrorism funds , National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel official Sagi Volkovitz said at a government conference on Tuesday . His agency is part of the Defense Ministry . Volkovitz gave complex examples of groups that would sell or deliver goods to Hamas in Gaza to get around banking regulations , while a seemingly disconnected Hamas office in a foreign country would pay for something in return that regulators would be hard-pressed to make a connection with . The conference primarily highlighted the 20th anniversary and work of the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority ( IMPA ) headed by Shlomit Wagman , but it also featured officials from other agencies , including the police , the prosecution and the courts . Wagman said the IMPA works with the police , the prosecution , tax agencies , but also & ldquo;with the Mossad , the Shin Bet [ Israel Security Agency ] and other agencies in ways that I cannot specify , & rdquo ; to combat terrorist financing and money-laundering . She said the IMPA helps intelligence agencies and law enforcement to be able to arrive at declaring certain groups as terrorist organizations by helping them connect Israel&rsquo;s adversaries&rsquo ; complex schemes and financial dots . & ldquo;Our joining the FATF [ Financial Action Task Force ] was noted as a difficulty for Iran , & rsquo ; & rsquo ; as the Islamic Republic has tried , and failed to date , to get its name off the FATF global agency economic blacklist , she said . The FATF is a global money-laundering and terrorism-financing watchdog . She praised the country&rsquo;s new economic crime-focused courts for their special expertise in money-laundering and terrorism-financing cases so that the government can seize illegal funds faster , where sometimes & ldquo;there are billions at stake . & rdquo ; Tel Aviv District Court Judge and head of the special Economic Crimes Courts Khaled Kabuv said the move to establish these specially focused courts started around three years ago after he and other judges were exposed at various conferences to the level of complexity in the field . After he repeatedly heard and was shown that the special legal and factual expertise needed to handle terrorism-financing , money-laundering and legal disputes over new kinds of digital currency was far beyond the judges&rsquo ; current capacity , he helped push to establish courts rooted in that expertise . He said that with specially trained judges , cases that once could take more than a decade due to their complexity and the judge&rsquo;s lack of familiarity with the intricate issues involved , now could be resolved in only two to three years . Kabuv said there were heated debates about establishing courts and judges focused in these areas , and also about whether there should be separate units to deal with money-laundering and digital issues versus corporate and securities legal disputes . In the end though , Kabuv said he helped convince key decision-makers that one economic-focused court unit was the right way to go . He added that they had made a lot of progress and that in a few more years , the vision would be fully realized . Speaking by video , FATF president Dr . Marcus Pleyer said , & ldquo;Money laundering poses a threat not only to our financial systems , but also to the rule of law . & rdquo ; He emphasized the FATF&rsquo;s new focus to combat the , & ldquo;financing of extreme right-wing terrorism , & rdquo ; something that has sometimes been overlooked in the past . Globally , he said there is $ 260 billion in illegal financial transactions taking place to facilitate the same violent criminal organizations that distribute drugs and cause other problems.Pleyer warned that & ldquo;many countries have not implemented laws effectively , & rdquo ; even if they have solid laws for combating illegal transactions on the books . He said more countries will need to start looking underneath trusts and other complex financial mechanisms used to conceal the real owner of certain illegal funds , including learning more about foreign companies . Justice Minister Gideon Sa&rsquo;ar credited the IMPA with helping turn the tide in the battle to reduce internal violence within the Israeli-Arab sector . Also on Tuesday , the IMPA published a report noting that the volume of cyberattacks against Israel in 2021 had jumped seven times as compared to 2020 . The report highlighted the large number of ransomware attacks where Iran was the true sponsor once the IMPA pierced the veil of third parties fronting the attacks . Further , the report went into extensive detail to deconstruct patterns and criminal probes that helped identify Iranian involvement as the mastermind pulling the strings . In terms of the impact , the report said that 42 % of large Israeli businesses have experienced cyberattacks . Some 91 % of those harmed by cyberattacks never report the harm to the authorities and around 80 % of those businesses that paid the ransomware demanded of them ended up facing repeat attacks afterward .",israel seized nis 103 million hamas terror funds - counterterror financial official

Then we survey each species and look at what we have , what damages have occurred , and we wait a few years to replant . We prefer to let natural processes occur to bring back the forest if possible . & ndash ; so there are immediate actions and some long-term actions . & rdquo ; Ostrovsky estimates that it will take a year to rebuild damaged infrastructure , but the time it will take to restore the vegetation depends on the severity of the damage.Another challenge that has presented itself in the restoration of the forests during the war is the fact that a number of KKL-JNF foresters have been serving in the IDF , thereby reducing the number of foresters available . Nevertheless , he says , & ldquo;We know we have a lot of work , but we think that we can handle it . & rdquo;Ostrovsky adds that Israelis appreciate the open spaces and tranquility provided by the forests during these difficult times , just as they were valued during Corona . One of the main goals of KKL-JNF , he notes , is keeping the forest clean and well-maintained and ensuring that Israel&rsquo;s forest areas remain large enough in the face of continued development within the country.Another significant issue in forestry today is climate change . Ostrovsky says that KKL-JNF has recently completed a policy paper to prepare the forests for climate change and ensure the survival of trees and vegetation . & ldquo;Our policy guidelines are primarily about preventing fires , keeping the forest healthy , and making it more resilient in dealing with severe conditions . & rdquo ;",watch : ' this is how the israel-hamas war is impacting the environment '

Countries are not allowed to release the results of their votes during the semi-finals.Golan won&rsquo;t be the only Israeli performing in the final , because Jerusalem-born Tali Golergant , who is representing Luxembourg , won a place after she performed her song , & ldquo;Fighter , & rdquo ; in the first semi-final on Tuesday night .

The first drone was launched at the vessel at about 10:30 p.m .

Additionally , the US Navy said it shot down a drone that was launched from a Houthi-controlled area of Yemen.A few days earlier , three commercial vessels came under attack in the southern Red Sea , with the Houthis saying they had conducted drone and missile attacks against two Israeli vessels .

2024-03-29 10:55:20.533,jpost,"Contrary to most reports , Salim Joubran , who died on March 15 , was not the first Israeli-Arab Supreme Court justice when he was appointed in 2003.Technically , that distinction goes to Abdel Rahman Zuabi , who received a temporary appointment as a Supreme Court justice in 1999.However , Zuabi served for only nine months.Joubran served from 2003 to 2017 and finished with the rank of deputy chief justice , as well as being the first Israeli-Arab to chair the Central Elections Commission.In that sense , he was the father of the idea that a minimum of one seat should be an Israeli-Arab.Since then , his seat was filled by two other Israeli-Arabs . First George Karra , for a short term ; and now by Khaled Kabub.In that regard , Joubran convinced the Jews of Israel that the court&rsquo;s identity must somewhat reflect the country&rsquo;s multi-religious nature , and convinced the Arabs of Israel that partnering with Israeli society can be worth it and have real results.Not everything was perfect . There was an incident in 2012 when Joubran came under attack by many in the political sphere when he stood for the singing of & ldquo;Hatikvah&rdquo ; during a state ceremony , but he clearly did not sing the words.Ultimately , Joubran weathered the storm , with many mainstream political and judicial officials pointing out that as long as he stood and conveyed respect , that neither he , nor Israeli-Arab soldiers , could be expected to sing about Jewish longing to return to their homeland.Orthodox former deputy chief justice Elyakim Rubinstein was one of those who publicly came to Joubran&rsquo;s defense at the time , and he eulogized Joubran last week as one of his close friends in the court.Most of the time , though , Joubran managed to stay out of and above politics.He represented Israel around the world and served as one of its brightest lights in embodying Israeli multicultural coexistence.Whenever critics tried to tear Israel down as discriminating against Arabs , the example of Joubran could be rolled out as a stark contrast to that narrative.Joubran was involved in a myriad of historic decisions.He was on the panel of three justices who rejected the appeal of former president Moshe Katsav , sending him to prison for seven years for rape and sexual abuse.Likewise , he was on the bench of five justices who rejected part of the appeal of former prime minister Ehud Olmert , sending him to jail for two plus years on various charges of public corruption.Ever the independent thinker , Joubran was the one dissenting vote on the Olmert panel when four justices tossed out the largest conviction for Olmert having allegedly requested that a middle man give NIS 500,000 to the former prime minister&rsquo;s brother , Yossi Olmert . Had they listened to Joubran , Olmert would have spent many more years in prison.Regarding equality issues , he was a consistent and unabashedly liberal voice whether for Jews or for Arabs . He wrote soaring opinions about justice and fairness that even his conservative critics sometimes respected more than they respected quieter closet activists , who often ruled liberally but tried to frame themselves in technical non-activist terms.In his final case & ndash ; a 2017 ruling on same-sex couples&rsquo ; surrogacy rights & ndash ; Joubran said that he found it difficult to come to terms with a situation in which single people and same-sex couples were blocked from fulfilling their dreams to become parents through surrogacy agreements.He said he could not see the justice of giving preference to heterosexual parents over same-sex parents , though the court as a whole deferred the issue for six months to give the Knesset time to resolve legislation on the issue which it was already considering.In addition , Joubran advocated religious freedom and pluralism for Jews , often banging heads with the haredi rabbinic establishment.Regarding Israeli-Arab equality , he dissented in a major 2014 razor-thin 5-4 Supreme Court decision which kept a law in place that allowed & ldquo;acceptance committees&rdquo ; to vet and reject candidates using vague criteria for around 434 yishuvim ( villages ) in the Negev and the Galilee.That law replaced an earlier law previously struck down by the Supreme Court which explicitly permitted discrimination against Israeli-Arabs in those villages.However , Joubran and three other dissenting justices said that the new law would be used to achieve the same outcome and impact as the old law of discriminating against Israeli-Arabs , and possibly sometimes against haredim or other minority groups . This was even if , at face value , the new law did not explicitly discriminate.The new brand of moderate-formalist activists allied with a growing group of conservatives to keep the law , but unapologetic liberals like Joubran could not stand a law which would likely cause inequality , even if there were technical reasons to avoid or delay striking the law until it played out more in the real world.In 2016 , in the High Court&rsquo;s 4-1 decision , Joubran got to vote in the majority against justice Noam Sohlberg , invalidating a 10-year price freeze and cap on legal liability rule that was part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s natural gas policy.Joubran also voted 3-2 in the majority against Sohlberg and then-justice Esther Hayut to suspend the policy for a year while the government would adjust the price and liability issues.But in that same series of rulings , the Supreme Court affirmed virtually all of the many other aspects of the policy by a 4-1 majority , with only Joubran dissenting.This included empowering Netanyahu to override and circumvent objections of the antitrust authority on the grounds of national security.This was huge.The prime minister , acting as his own economy minister , could override the antitrust authority on a question of economics using national security as a reason.Joubran had no problem switching back to being in the minority on that issue to check what he regarded as executive power overreach.Critics would say that Joubran harmed the country&rsquo;s economic development and imposed his own world view in place of the representative of the voters , Netanyahu.But Joubran viewed the court as the last line of defense of those in society who were weaker ; and if that meant protecting the antitrust authority in a way that slowed down economic development , he was at peace with that . Unlike other liberal justices , he was willing to say it out loud.I met Joubran a number of times at conferences and Supreme Court ceremonies , and I saw him in action countless times on the bench.There were some on the bench who struck me as having been promoted up through the ranks but basically remaining the same as they had always been , simply at a higher rung within the judiciary.Joubran seemed to hold himself differently and think in terms of his place and the court&rsquo;s place in history , and trying to find the right side of history to be on without getting dragged down into the technicalities of the moment.Once again , conservatives would not like many of his rulings but would honor his honesty and the sense that he was a true believer and not just playing the politics of his sector of society.I also found him to be kind and a gentleman , with a lightness in an old-fashioned way that is hard to capture in the social media punchy age of 2024.A graduate of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Joubran practiced private law from 1970 until 1982 before leaving to accept an appointment to the Haifa Magistrate&rsquo;s Court . In 1993 , he was appointed to the Haifa District Court , and was then promoted to the Supreme Court in 2003.At his retirement , he preached stronger commitment to coexistence and to integration of Israel&rsquo;s Arab minority.In an age of unbridled partisanship and personal ambition , Joubran&rsquo;s voice of being respectful , honest , and genuinely committed to the State of Israel , though his background could have given him every excuse to take an opposite path , will be missed .",meet former deputy chief justice salim joubran : the embodiment of coexistence
2024-06-09 20:41:34.063,jpost,"Minister-without-Portfolio Benny Gantz resigned on Sunday from the emergency government in a move that will not collapse the coalition but that leaves Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu more dependent on his far Right partners . & ldquo;Netanyahu is preventing us from moving forward to a real victory , & rdquo ; said Gantz in a press conference designed for the prime-time news hour . & ldquo;And so today , we are leaving the emergency government with a heavy heart & ndash ; but with our whole heart . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Fateful , strategic decisions are met with hesitance and procrastination due to political considerations , & rdquo ; Gantz added in criticism of the current government&rsquo;s recent behavior . He called for elections to be held in the fall , urging Netanyahu to set an agreed-upon date for them to occur.The departure of his National Unity Party , which had entered the government at the start of the war purely due to the emergency nature of the government , is set to impact the small war cabinet of which he and the number two in his party , former IDF chief-of-staff Lt . - Gen . Gadi Eisenkot , were members.Gantz calls for electionsThe war will continue for years , said Gantz , telling Israelis that he & ldquo;will not promise [ them ] a quick and easy victory . You deserve more than empty promises . But Israel should and must achieve real victory . & rdquo;Their departure comes as Netanyahu has given a nod to a three-phase hostage deal , which Gantz supports but which coalition factions Otzma Yehudit and the Religious Zionist Party oppose . Both of these parties , notably , make up 14 out of the 64 seats that the coalition is comprised of.Gantz expressed his support for the hostage deal presented by US President Joe Biden while urging Netanyahu to stand behind it . I & ldquo;demand that the prime minister show the necessary courage to stand behind it and do everything to move it forward , & rdquo ; he stated.In an apology to the families of the hostages , Gantz said , & ldquo;We did a lot & ndash ; but we failed the test . We have not managed to bring many of the hostages home . The responsibility is mine as well . & rdquo;He also called for the formation of a national probe to & ldquo;examine the failures from within and protect from hypocritical attacks from without . & rdquo ; Gantz praised Defense Minister Yoav Gallant , calling him a brave and determined leader , and telling him that now is the time not only to say what is right , but & ldquo;to do what is right . & rdquo;Netanyahu responded to the announcement saying , & ldquo;Israel is in an existential war on several fronts . Benny , now is not the time to abandon the fight , it is the time to combine forces . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Citizens of Israel , we will keep fighting until victory and until the achievement of all of the goals of the war , first of which is to free all of our hostages and to eliminate Hamas , & rdquo ; Netanyahu proclaimed . & ldquo;My door will stay open to any Zionist party that is willing to share the burden and help bring victory over our enemies and ensure the safety of our citizens , & rdquo ; he stressed . Further , Eisenkot addressed Netanyahu in his resignation letter , which was submitted on Sunday . & ldquo;Despite my many efforts , alongside my colleagues&rsquo ; , the cabinet led by you has , for a while , avoided making real decisions that are needed to achieve the goals of the war and improve Israel&rsquo;s strategic stance , & rdquo ; he said.National Security Minister and Otzma Yehudit head Itamar Ben-Gvir immediately demanded to be added to the war cabinet . & ldquo;It is time to make brave decisions , to get real deterrence , and to bring security to the South , the North , and all of Israel , & rdquo ; he said.Finance Minister and & nbsp;Religious Zionist Party leader Bezalel Smotrich criticized the move , saying that it was the wrong one to make in the midst of war . & ldquo;Benny , when you began to share the burden eight months ago , you did a brave and correct thing , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;Understanding the importance [ of the need of the hour and ] despite [ our ] differences , I agreed to step aside and be left out of managing the war . Since then , I have backed up a number of decisions that I really do not agree with simply because unity is vital to victory , & rdquo ; Smotrich added.He went on to call on all Zionist party heads to join a unity government & ldquo;until victory . & rdquo ; Opposition leader Yair Lapid praised the decision saying , & ldquo;Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot&rsquo;s decision to leave the government is both justified and important . & rdquo ; & ldquo;It&rsquo;s time to replace this extremist and failing government with a government that will restore security for the people of Israel , bring the hostages home , rebuild the economy , and restore Israel&rsquo;s international standing , & rdquo ; he said.Gantz had announced on May 18 that his party would leave the government on June 8 if Netanyahu did not adopt six objectives : Returning the hostages ; demolishing Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip ; providing a governing alternative in Gaza ; returning residents of the North to their homes by September 1 and rehabilitating the western Negev ; promoting normalization with Saudi Arabia ; and adopting an outline for standardized national service , in which all Israelis will serve their country.National Unity goes on the offensiveMembers of Gantz&rsquo;s party took steps last week to oppose the government . MK Orit Farkash-Hacohen put forward a bill to form a national committee of inquiry on the events leading up to and during Oct . 7 and on what has transpired since.In addition , MK Pnina Tamano-Shata put forward a bill to disperse the Knesset , which would lead to an election.Eliav Breuer and Jerusalem Post Staff contributed to this report .",benny gantz resigns from wartime government

There has not been a meeting between an Israeli defense minister and or prime minister in years . Talks between Israel and the PA broke down in 2014 and have never been revived . But Gantz hinted at the possibility of a meeting with the Palestinians when he spoke Thursday night at a special virtual Zoom gathering for Jews who live in Latin America to mark the eighth day of Hanukkah , which was sponsored by both the Jewish Agency and the Strategic Affairs Ministry . It was important to advance normalization with the Palestinians , Gantz said , even if , & ldquo;it is very hard at this stage to arrive at a final status agreement . & rdquo ; Gantz clarified his position on a number of issues relating to the conflict , noting that he did & ldquo;We will not withdraw to the pre-1967 lines . & rdquo ; With respect to Jerusalem he quoted from the Psalms , stating that Israel would not give up on the idea of & ldquo;Jerusalem , a city that is knitted together . & rdquo ; In the West Bank , he said , it is important to build only on state land and not to build settler homes on private Palestinian land . In response to a question about the continued leadership of PA President Mahmoud Abbas , Gantz said that there was not a replacement for him currently . Gantz lauded Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s leadership with respect to the ratification of two normalization deals with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain as well as the declarations of three additional deals with Sudan , Morocco and Bhutan .

This year , Israel&rsquo;s representative , Eden Golan , has the additional burden of being the focus of protests and boycott calls over the Gaza war.One performer who has been there had some prescient advice for the 20-year-old Golan , who performed in the semi-finals of the competition late Thursday night . & ldquo;Embrace and cherish the moment , & rdquo ; said iconic singer Gali Atari , who represented Israel at Eurovision in 1979 as part of Milk and Honey and won with the legendary & ldquo;Hallelujah . & rdquo ; & ldquo;She should try and savor this pivotal moment in her life .

On stage , with his gaunt almost haggard features and eyes fixed on the violin , he seems like a Mephistophelean figure , conjoined with the violin as it abides and subjugates itself to his technique . & nbsp;Just before arriving in Israel for the first time since the Gaza war began , the New York-based Shaham told The Jerusalem Post that he was eager to visit the country . & ldquo;Look , these are tragic times . It&rsquo;s just an ocean of suffering and tragedy , an ocean of pain . And I do feel that music has a way to bring solace to people . I think music is very life-affirming and brings people together , & rdquo ; he said , appearing uneasy discussing the political situation . & ldquo;You know , there was one time when we performed with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli Philharmonic at the BBC Proms , and as we were playing , there were loud protests coming from outside , and even louder counter-protests . I looked at Zubin , and he sort of looked at me and said , & lsquo;Just keep playing , just keep making music . & rsquo ; I thought that was a good statement on many levels . & rdquo;According to Shaham , Dvor&aacute;k&rsquo;s Violin Concerto is one of his masterpieces . & ldquo;I was thinking a little bit about Beethoven and the great works of the past . Many of them were written during brutal , terrible times . The Dvor&aacute;k Violin Concerto has a very Beethovenian narrative . When you take a piece that starts in the minor mode but at the end arrives in the major , it really offers hope , you know . And it&rsquo;s so uplifting in that way . And I think that&rsquo;s also true for the piece we will be playing , & rdquo ; he said.A perfect fitHaving performed with the IPO since the 1980s under Mehta , Shaham has had a perfect seat to see its developments over the years . & ldquo;I think they are playing better than ever before . There are so many star musicians there , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting for me because nowadays , I feel I&rsquo;m probably one of the older people on stage .

2024-04-09 17:36:13.903,jpost,"National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir's announcement on Monday regarding his choice of Israel&rsquo;s next police chief , Avshalom Peled , served not just as a general announcement , but also as a warning to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he could act to topple the government if Israel agrees to concessions in a hostage deal that Ben-Gvir opposes.Ben-Gvir's announcement was not brought for approval to minister Benny Gantz's National Unity party , which responded on Monday evening that it expected Netanyahu to respect a coalition agreement giving it veto power over major appointments.The fact that Ben-Gvir made the announcement without taking Gantz into account plants the excuse to leave the government if Gantz applies his veto . This connects directly to a threat from Ben-Gvir earlier on Monday , in a post on X , that if Netanyahu ends Israel's war against Hamas without an extensive attack on Hamas in Rafah , he will & ldquo;cease to have a mandate to serve as prime minister . & rdquo;In other words , the timing of the police chief appointment wasn&rsquo;t a coincidence , but a reminder of Ben-Gvir&rsquo;s leverage over Netanyahu . In order to dissolve the 120-member Knesset and force an election , 61 MKs must support its dissolution . The departure of Ben-Gvir&rsquo;s six seats in itself is not enough to bring down the 72 seat governing coalition , but it will give Gantz the power to bring down the government in the near future by leaving with his eight seats.Ben-Gvir is hovering around the 10-seat mark in most polls , and he thus stands to gain from an election . But in order not to receive blame for the rise of a possible centrist government , he needs to be able to explain to his voters why he decided to leave . Inaction on Rafah coupled with an inability to move forward with his choice of commissioner would serve as an adequate reason.Unilaterally announcing Peled as his choice for police chief may be a relatively empty threat , as it first must receive the approval of Israel&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Senior Civil Service Appointments . This committee usually approves the candidates brought before it , but in Peled&rsquo;s case , it may not.Peled engaged in illegal quid-pro-quoThe Police Investigations Department recommended in 2015 that he not be promoted after a recording revealed that he engaged in a seemingly illegal quid-pro-quo with a local authority leader . Peled wasn&rsquo;t indicted after the recording was disqualified as evidence due to privacy-related infractions . Then-police chief Roni Alsheich ignored the recommendation and promoted Peled , but the advisory committee may not.Still , Ben-Gvir&rsquo;s announcement and National Unity&rsquo;s subsequent response that it expected Netanyahu to respect its veto power , if it chooses to use it , upped the pressure on the prime minister to appease Ben-Gvir by other means to keep the national security minister on board.The move was typical of Ben-Gvir , who , on a number of occasions , has threatened to leave the government unless he receives certain concessions . For example , Ben-Gvir threatened to jump ship when Netanyahu was about to announce a freeze on the judicial reforms just over a year ago , following mass protests and strikes . Netanyahu convinced him to stay despite the freeze by agreeing to a government decision to begin the process of forming a National Guard , which was a major policy goal for Ben-Gvir.This time around , Ben-Gvir may condition remaining in the government after a hostage deal on a commitment from Netanyahu to push through Peled&rsquo;s appointment regardless of the National Unity veto . If Peled&rsquo;s candidacy is struck down , Ben-Gvir will likely demand something else.For most of 2023 , Ben-Gvir was considered a loose cannon and the largest potential threat to Netanyahu&rsquo;s government . But with haredi parties taking over in recent months as the major political threat due to the issue of haredi national service , Ben-Gvir made his presence felt and reminded the prime minister that he must be taken into account as well . & nbsp ;",ben-gvir's police chief announcement is a veiled political threat - analysis

He was married and a father of two young children.The mother of Tamari's wife , Tali , is the second wife of Binyamin Horgen , who lost his first wife , Esther Horgen , in a terrorist attack in the Reihan Forest , north of Hermesh , in 2020.The Fatah-linked al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades group reportedly took credit for the attack and there were suspicions that the terrorists were hiding in the Jenin area.IDF soldiers operate in the area of a shooting attack near Hermesh . ( Credit : IDF Spokesperson's Unit)Further , the terror group sent out messages to Palestinians in the area to erase any security video camera footage to prevent Israeli security forces from tracking the culprits movements.For their part , security forces were almost immediately on a manhunt to catch the terrorist perpetrators as the IDF erected additional checkpoints to limit their ability to maneuver.There was some controversy from local Israeli leaders who claimed that the incident would have been avoided if a nearby checkpoint had not been abandoned . In contrast , the IDF said that the checkpoint would have made no difference because the shooting took place using a drive-by firing tactic . Even after the incident , the IDF said that while it has increased its presence in the general area and that its nearby forces can man the checkpoint in question quickly if needed , it has no plans to add forces to man the specific checkpoint round-the-clock that local Israeli leaders want to be reinforced.Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said early Tuesday afternoon that he had received a security update on the situation and that he would hold an additional wider meeting with top defense officials in the coming hours.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences to the Tamari family on Tuesday afternoon , saying "" Our forces are currently in pursuit of the terrorists in order to settle accounts with them , and they will be settled forthwith . Just as we have found every terrorist and closed accounts with them , we will do so this time as well .

2024-03-07 19:59:38.290,jpost,"Israel raised eight billion dollars in bond sales , setting a record with the highest-ever demand for an Israeli international bond offering , the Finance Ministry&rsquo;s Accountant General&rsquo;s office announced on Wednesday . Demand for the offering , launched on Tuesday , reached $ 38 billion , and some 400 investors from 36 countries participated , the ministry added.The bonds were sold as part of the Finance Ministry&rsquo;s strategy to fund the government&rsquo;s activity as the Israel-Hamas war continues to impact Israel&rsquo;s economy.Selling bonds allows Israel to raise money to cover current budgetary needs by essentially borrowing money from those who buy the bonds . A government bond represents a debt owed by the government to the person who buys the bond . The government must repay that debt in the specified time frame and interest to the buyer . Thirty-year , ten-year , and five-year bonds were sold in the issuing.The bond offering results showed that Israel would pay 135 basis points over comparable 5-year US Treasuries , 145 basis points over 10-year Treasuries , and 175 basis points over US 30-year bonds . This means that Israel will pay higher interest rates than comparable US bonds issued over a similar time frame.Smotrich and Rothenberg celebrate change in bond salesRothenberg and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich celebrated the record-breaking debt issuance , pointing to the high demand as an important expression of foreign investors&rsquo ; faith in Israeli markets . This expression follows a tumultuous time for Israel&rsquo;s economy , as government bonds have underperformed the most widely-followed global emerging market bond index by just over ten percentage points over the last six months , along with Moody&rsquo;s cut Israel&rsquo;s credit rating last month.Moody&rsquo;s downgraded Israel&rsquo;s credit rating to & ldquo;A2&rdquo ; from & ldquo;A1&rdquo ; in early February , citing material political and fiscal risks for the country due to its war with Hamas . & ldquo;While fighting in Gaza may diminish in intensity or pause , there is currently no agreement to end the hostilities durably and no agreement on a longer-term plan that would fully restore and eventually strengthen security for Israel , & rdquo ; Moody&rsquo;s said at the time.This lower credit rating is an indication of a higher risk of investing in Israeli securities . This risk impacts the interest paid for Israeli bonds . A higher-risk investment pays a higher interest to compensate investors for this risk.According to Accountant General Yali Rothenberg , the majority of similar bond offerings will be on local markets , such as in shekel bond sales . These offerings may also impact inflation in Israel . When Israelis buy bonds , it reduces the amount of money in circulation in the Israeli economy and so may slow inflation.Israel&rsquo;s inflation was above the target rate when the war began , but currently , Inflation is moderated and stands at 2.6 % , & rdquo ; said Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron on Tuesday . & ldquo;Expectations for inflation for the coming year have risen slightly .

Even in his state of mourning , the Bedouin ritual of hospitality is paramount . & nbsp;Just two weeks ago , on the first day of the war , he and his brothers were sitting in a similar shig with their children , on this little hilltop 4.5 km . north of the Bedouin town of Kuseife , some 65 km . from Gaza , when suddenly they heard a missile fly overhead and land in their animal pens . One of the brothers went out to check on the penned animals , while another went to check on the camel . Saed was just coming into the shig with the coffee finjan in his hand when a second missile landed in front of him , on the tin shig where the children were sitting . The flimsy shig was flattened as if it were literally a tin-can , burying the five boys underneath the rubble . & nbsp;It took the brothers 15 minutes to dig them out with their bare hands & ndash ; they didn&rsquo;t have any tools to use & ndash ; and another 20 minutes to get them to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba . Four of the boys & ndash ; brothers Malek al-Qaran , 14 , and Jawad al-Qaran , 15 , and cousins Amin Akal al-Qaran , 16 , and Mohammad D&rsquo;ib al-Qaran , 12 & ndash ; were already dead by the time they got there . Another cousin , Taleb Mahmoud al-Qaran , 35 , was seriously wounded but survived and is being treated in a hospital in the center of the country.Ibrahim , the father of two of the boys killed in the missile attack , walks in silently , his head wrapped loosely with a scarf . There is nothing to say , and the two men sit silently as one , and then another cousin comes to sit on the rugs , and Saed serves them coffee.The corrugated tin panels that used to make up the shig where the boys died lie flat in a pile next to a new shig which has been quickly built to replace it . & nbsp;Here , in this isolated place in the desert , their little village is one of some 35 unrecognized Bedouin villages dotting the Negev desert . Despite numerous requests to the government from the residents , they have no air raid sirens , nor are they allowed to build a safe room or communal bomb shelter , so the boys had no chance . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We have everything we need here , & rdquo ; Saed , who served in the IDF , said . & ldquo;We just need bomb shelters . & rdquo ; & nbsp;So far , no temporary bomb shelters have been set up for the unrecognized villages , although at the entrance of the village the Islamic Movement brought two large cement pipes and placed cement slabs on either side & ndash ; as if that would protect anyone . According to Saed , the Dead Sea Works potash plant put together a & ldquo;shelter&rdquo ; with huge industrialized-size bags of dirt but no roof covering . Neither shelter affords protection worth the effort of trying to reach it during a rocket attack.Some 400,000 Bedouin live in Israel in an area ranging from Beersheba to Arad . This includes 100,000 in the 35 unrecognized villages , such as al-Bat , which have no electricity , running water , paved roads , or school infrastructure ; and 300,000 in seven established towns . Thus the Negev Bedouin represent the most vulnerable socioeconomic group in Israel . & nbsp;According to the Association for Civil Rights in Israel , at one point there were 46 unrecognized Bedouin villages . Following the state&rsquo;s recognition of 11 of them , 35 villages in the Negev still remain unrecognized , with some still in the same locations since before the creation of the State of Israel , and others in their current locations following Israel&rsquo;s transfer of the residents there during the period of military rule . & nbsp;Since the Hamas terrorist attack on October 7 , at least 26 Bedouin citizens of Israel have been killed & ndash ; 19 by Hamas terrorists in the kibbutzim where they were working early on that Saturday morning , and seven by Hamas missiles . Osama Abu Asa , a Bedouin guard at the Supernova concert , was killed as he attempted to protect some of the young people hiding in a bomb shelter , believing that Hamas would not kill him because he was a Muslim . Abed Alrahman Ataf Alzeadna , 26 , from Rahat , was among those killed by Hamas terrorists on Zikim Beach ; and four of his relatives , who were with him , are still missingTaken hostageSix Bedouin who were working in the Holit dairy were kidnapped , including four members of the Ziadna family : father Yosef , 53 ; sons Hamza , 22 , and Belal , 19 ; and daughter Aisha , 17 . & nbsp;In addition , said Jamal Al-Kirnawi , a Bedouin social worker and director of New Dawn & ndash ; a Rahat-based Bedouin-Jewish coexistence NGO that provides programming for at-risk Bedouin youth & ndash ; several Bedouin soldiers have been taken hostage , although how many has not been made official . & nbsp;If the attack had taken place on Sunday , there would have been many more Bedouin victims , as many are agriculture workers at the kibbutzim , he added . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Bedouins are really suffering , & rdquo ; Al-Kirnawi , 44 , said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We were all shocked by what happened on October 7 . No one knew what was going on . We thought it was rocket attacks like we are used to , and that soon there would be an army response . We were not expecting anything like this . The society has been in shock & ndash ; especially the Bedouin who worked in the kibbutzim . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We feel very sorry for this loss and pain . The rockets and Hamas did not differentiate between Jews and Bedouin . & rdquo;He lost 20 close Jewish friends from the kibbutzim in the terrorist attack and said he is still living in mourning , as he has spent the weeks since the attack going from funeral to funeral and shiva to shiva . & nbsp ; & ldquo;If on a daily basis we as Bedouins live in a complex reality , imagine the reality of uncertain chaos that we are living in now , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The war makes it much worse in the complexity of the society & ndash ; how to handle this tragic crisis . No one is able to understand this biggest tragedy that has happened . We feel the suffering of the families , and we can&rsquo;t contain all the stories of loss . We are not in a normal situation and are processing this loss . & rdquo;The economy of Bedouin towns has shut down since October 7 , and the many Bedouins who worked in the kibbutzim have lost their employment . But for Al-Kirnawi , the most difficult thing is that as a traditional society , many people in his community are suffering from anxiety and trauma ; but , in addition to municipal social welfare services being shut down and the government in general not functioning , the whole concept of counseling is still not widely accepted in Bedouin society , especially in the more traditional sectors . & ldquo;People are suffering , whether they speak about it or not , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;But in general , Bedouin society takes what is happening on the outside and keeps it inside , without interpreting how that affects them [ on the inside ] . & rdquo;He added : & ldquo;The concept of therapy is very hard , and usually people come to therapy when they are overwhelmed . So we need to be proactive before people get so overwhelmed that they need major intervention . & rdquo;Trauma training for Bedouin mental health workersNew Dawn has begun special trauma training for educators and mental health workers within the Bedouin community , who pay several visits to the families directly affected by the war reaching out with mental health tools to help them cope with the loss , trauma , and anxiety they are feeling , he said . & nbsp;Initially , they have trained seven men and women who have gone to attend to the most vulnerable in five villages , and there are plans for further training sessions . & ldquo;We can&rsquo;t wait for [ government offices ] . We , as a civil society , are much more powerful [ than the government ] , & rdquo ; he said.Manar Abu Gosh , 25 , a resident of Rahat and social worker and volunteer at New Dawn who has gone through the training , has begun visiting residents of the unrecognized villages . The children are scared , and many of the parents are in shock and not able to function normally , she said . A missile fell near one of the villages while she was there , she noted . & ldquo;We heard the sound of the missile , but we didn&rsquo;t know where to run . The children were terrified , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;They are in a panic . & rdquo;The men , who worked largely in agriculture , are now unemployed , and the children can&rsquo;t participate in the remote video classes because they have no Internet services nor tablets , Abu Gosh said . & ldquo;They are , after all , citizens who want to live in peace and quiet , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The men do not want to talk about how they are feeling , but the women and children come and speak about their worries and fears . Honestly , I came home and cried . It was the first time I was ever in an unrecognized village . I was shocked by what is happening to them . They are in a terrible situation . But I will continue to go to speak with them . It is not easy for any of us . & rdquo;President Isaac Herzog visited the Bedouin Situation Room in Rahat on October 26 , where Jewish and Arab Israelis are working together to provide care packages for the most needy of the area&rsquo;s residents , and met with community leaders and families of the missing and murdered of the community , including representatives of the Ziadna family . & ldquo;We will continue to live together , and it is important for me to tell the entire Arab society in Israel how much I appreciate the responsibility shown across the community in these difficult days , & rdquo ; he told them on October 26 . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We deeply share in their grief . I came to offer my sympathies to the families , and we will meet with them again . We came to offer strength to the local authorities and to hear what is important to them . We came to tell everyone : We will continue to live together and continue to live in peace . & ldquo;What we saw on October 7 does not represent Islam . Islam is a religion of respect , sensitivity , brotherhood , and love . & rdquo;Quiet vigil for four family membersA few days before the president&rsquo;s visit , in the Ziadna neighborhood of Rahat & ndash ; a conglomeration of tin huts and small gardens outside of Rahat & ndash ; the uncles , brothers , and nephews of Yosef Ziadna , kidnapped along with his three children , sit on white plastic chairs in a large circle in a vigil outside a home . The young men all sport beards and are powerfully built , but in their eyes are broken spirits , waiting to hear about their loved ones . At the time of the visit , all four & ndash ; including daughter Aisha , who wears the traditional Muslim hijab & ndash ; were presumed to be held hostage in Gaza.Yosef&rsquo;s brother Salem had also been at the Holit dairy on October 7 with his four young children as every Saturday , taking the youngsters on a & ldquo;fun day&rdquo ; to see the cows . He describes how for 12 harrowing hours he evaded the terrorists by hiding and darting through the dairy with his four terrified children , carrying the two the littlest ones in his arms . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I heard shooting all the time . My children were so scared , they kept very quiet . Twice they captured us but I was able to escape , but sadly Yosef and his children were captured , & rdquo ; he said . Though an uncle is hesitant about speaking to the press , Salem said he wants the story of his escape to be published in as many media outlets as possible , in the rare possibility that perhaps Yosef or his children will see it and then know that he and his children are safe . & nbsp ; & ldquo;He is probably worried about us , too . I want to let him know that we are safe and got out . & rdquo;Bedouin rescuers save 70 at SupernovaOn that Black Saturday morning , as revelers from the Supernova dance festival were frantically trying to escape from the onslaught of the Hamas attack , Hamed Alkarnawi and his family members Rafi , Ismail , and Dahish & ndash ; all of Rahat & ndash ; rushed to the scene with their truck when their cousin Hisham , who worked in the dining room of Kibbutz Be&rsquo;eri , called them to tell them he and kibbutz member Aya Meidan & ndash ; who had gone out for a bike ride in the early morning & ndash ; were surrounded by Hamas terrorists . & nbsp;The rescuers have declined media interviews , but in a powerful video produced by Have You Seen the Horizon Lately ? & ndash ; an initiative promoting Jewish-Arab partnership & ndash ; Meidan and the Alkarnawis recounted the daring rescue they undertook . Under fire , they first rescued some 40 young people from the Supernova party whom they encountered on their way to Be&rsquo;eri hiding from the Hamas terrorists , and then made their way to rescue Hisham and Aya.Minivan driver Yosef El Zaidneh , 47 , also of the unrecognized neighborhood of Ziadna , who risked his life to save people from the party , has become an unlikely media hero after one of the people he rescued praised him and posted his phone number on social media to bring him more costumers . & nbsp;El Zaidneh described himself as a & ldquo;regular person , & rdquo ; who never served in the army , just someone who goes out every morning to work and comes home in the evening to his wife and children.That Saturday at 1 a.m . , he took a regular customer and eight friends from Omer to the Supernova dance party near Kibbutz Re&rsquo;im with instructions to return to pick them up later , at 1 p.m . But shortly after 6 a.m . , his phone began to ring incessantly and when his customer , Amit , told him there was a red alert of missiles , he told him he would be there in 20 minutes . But as he approached the junction to Kibbutz Sa&rsquo;ad , he saw cars coming toward him and people motioning him to go back . & ldquo;It is the first time in my life I have been afraid , & rdquo ; he said , but he continued through the gunfire and was able to rescue 30 young Israelis as he packed twice the number of passengers allowed into his minivan . He knew the terrain near the kibbutz well and made his way through the fields to safety , forging a way for other cars to follow him . & nbsp ; & ldquo;There was not one soldier there ; I saw wounded police . I knew if we went on the road to Re&rsquo;im , they would kill us . & rdquo;When they eventually reached a roadblock manned by Israeli police , they were directed to Kibbutz Tze&rsquo;elim . Sadly , his cousin , Abed al-Rahman Alnasarah , 50 , also a minivan driver , was killed by the terrorists as he attempted to reach the party to rescue Israelis there.Since that morning El Zaidneh , the father of seven children , has not been able to sleep , and the horrific scenes of death and destruction keep replaying in his head . & nbsp;He spends the nights chain smoking and drinking coffee , sitting outside on the swing in his fenced-in yard in front of his corrugated tin hut , praying for the morning to come . He saw things people should never have to see , he said . He has received threatening phone calls originating in Gaza from people claiming to be from Hamas who say they will find him because he rescued Israelis . He has reported the calls to the police , and his phone is under surveillance for any more threatening calls that come in , he said . He has been going to daily therapy sessions to help deal with the trauma . & nbsp;El Zaidneh has also received many phone calls from people who want to donate money to him or give him presents , he said , but he is not interested in any of that and often does not even answer his phone anymore unless he recognizes the number . He did not do what he did for any sort of recognition , he said . & ldquo;I had the chance to turn around . But above all , I am a human being , and I am an Israeli and I knew there were Israeli citizens [ in danger ] . If I can help , why not ? That is how our parents raised us . To do good if we can , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;I hope after this , the mayor of Omer & ndash ; who does not like us & ndash ; and the State of Israel will appreciate the Bedouin and stop destroying our houses and see that we are a part of this country . & ldquo;We are not Hamas . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I hope that the country will now think about us ; help the Bedouin develop in education , in culture . Maybe we won&rsquo;t be 100 % equal , but at least 70 % equal . & rdquo ;  Video of the Supernova rescue : x.com/Horizon_lately/status/1720905755371405633?t=KCzVUClfm7Y2_bsM2V13rA&amp;s=08","after hamas's massacre , israel's bedouin share their silent trauma"
2024-03-29 15:21:57.043,jpost,"Israel will forever be grateful to US President Joe Biden for the support that he showed the battered country in the days immediately following the October 7 massacre.Israel will forever be grateful for the way he stood by the country in its darkest hour , how he warned Iran and its proxy Hezbollah not to take advantage of the situation and fully open other fronts against Israel , and how he sent US aircraft carrier strike forces to the region to back up those warnings . And , indeed , Iran and Hezbollah were deterred.Israel will forever be grateful for the way Biden immediately launched an arms airlift to the country , making good on his promise to ensure that Israel has the wherewithal to defend itself.The country will also long remember the way he came here 11 days after Hamas&rsquo;s attack , the first US president to visit Israel in time of war , and relieved the country&rsquo;s stunning feeling of isolation by demonstrating genuine sympathy and empathy.Many , frankly , were surprised by the Democratic president&rsquo;s unequivocal , unstinting support . In the days and weeks immediately following October 7 , Biden did the right thing by Israel.Hamas welcomed the resolution that the US allowed to passOn Monday , by instructing the US not to veto Security Council Resolution 2728 calling for an immediate ceasefire for Ramadan that will lead to a & ldquo;lasting sustainable&rdquo ; ceasefire but not making that contingent on the Security Council&rsquo;s call in the same resolution for Hamas & ndash ; which it has yet to condemn for October 7 & ndash ; to release all the hostages , he did the wrong thing by Israel.It did not take long for the consequences of this action to be felt.Just hours after Hamas welcomed the resolution ( imagine the UN Security Council passing a resolution that ISIS or al-Qaeda , Hamas&rsquo;s twins , would welcome ) , the terrorist organization turned down the terms painstakingly hammered out in weeks of negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal.The refusal of the Security Council to even once & ndash ; either through a resolution or in a statement put out by its president & ndash ; condemn Hamas for its October 7 atrocity is staggering . Especially considering that the council knows how to condemn terrorism when Israel is not on the receiving end.For example , on March 22 , one day after a terrorist attack in Moscow killed some 140 people , the council issued a statement condemning & ldquo;in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly terrorist attack . & rdquo;The council swiftly issued a similar statement on Wednesday , within 24 hours of when a suicide bomber in Pakistan killed five Chinese workers and their Pakistani driver.Yet it&rsquo;s now 174 days since terrorists murdered 1,200 people in Israel , kidnapped more than 240 hostages , raped women , burned babies , mutilated bodies , set fire to entire communities , and no similar statement from the Security Council has yet been issued.And some still wonder why Israelis are cynical of world opinion and not particularly moved by Security Council actions.It is clear why Hamas rejected the hostage dealJust as it was clear why Hamas would welcome Monday&rsquo;s Security Council resolution , it is also equally clear why it rejected the hostage deal on the table.Hamas welcomed the resolution despite its call for an immediate release of all the hostages , because it knows that the world will focus on the first part of the first clause in the nonbinding resolution & ndash ; pressing Israel hard to stop the fighting & ndash ; and pay less attention to the second part of that same clause : a call for Hamas to release all the hostages.Why will the world not press the second part of that clause ? Because it knows full well that Hamas operates way outside the bounds of civil society and that the terrorist organization is not going to heed any such call.It was also clear following the resolution that Hamas would stiffen its conditions on a hostage deal , sensing that if it just holds out longer , international pressure will force Israel to stop the war , enabling the terrorist group to survive to fight & ndash ; meaning to murder , rape , and mutilate & ndash ; another day . Security Council Resolution 2728 undoubtedly strengthened Hamas&rsquo;s feeling that the international community would & ldquo;deliver&rdquo ; Israel.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s office put out a statement saying as much on Tuesday . & ldquo;Hamas&rsquo;s stance clearly demonstrates its utter disinterest in a negotiated deal and attests to the damage done by the UN Security Council&rsquo;s resolution . & rdquo;While there is a tendency among many pundits and most opposition politicians to reject anything Netanyahu says and to reflexively place the blame on Netanyahu rather than Biden whenever the two are at odds , in this case , that reflex is misplaced.Put aside whether , as a result of the US failure to veto the resolution , it was wise for Netanyahu to cancel Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and National Security Council head Tzachi Hanegbi&rsquo;s trip to Washington this week to consult on how to pursue the war in Rafah ( it wasn&rsquo;t ) , and whether moves such as these have political motivations ( they do ) . Nevertheless , Netanyahu is not always to blame in these confrontations with America , nor is Biden always free of fault.Don't assume that another PM would have better relations with the USOn Tuesday , one leading columnist wrote in Yediot Aharonot : & ldquo;Do we need anything more than what is happening in our relations with America to understand the abyss the prime minister is leading us into ? What else needs to happen to understand that every additional day he sits in his chair , our international situation deteriorates , and the crisis with our biggest and only friend & ndash ; our arms supplier & ndash ; gets worse ? & rdquo;The columnist assumes that were someone else sitting in the prime minister&rsquo;s chair right now , with the war in Gaza in its sixth month and pictures of Palestinians suffering flooding the traditional and social media in the West , Israel&rsquo;s situation in the world would be any better.But that is an erroneous assumption.Had even Yesh Atid&rsquo;s Yair Lapid been prime minister when October 7 happened , it is hard to believe that the country&rsquo;s policies toward Hamas and the IDF&rsquo;s way of prosecuting the war would be that significantly different from what they are now . While perhaps there would be more of an emphasis on the & ldquo;day after&rdquo ; and a more receptive ear to international pleas for more humanitarian aid into Gaza , Israel would have the same war aim it has now of destroying Hamas&rsquo;s capabilities.That aim & ndash ; unfortunately , because of the way Hamas has chosen to fight & ndash ; will lead to a high number of Palestinian civilian casualties and much Palestinian suffering , regardless of who is sitting in the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office . And it is those casualties and that suffering that , more than anything , are driving the wedge between Jerusalem and Washington.If you doubt this , look back to the days of the Naftali Bennett and Lapid tag-team government and think whether Israel&rsquo;s position among the progressive Democrats in the US was that much better than it is under Netanyahu . It wasn&rsquo;t , because the anti-Israel progressives and & ldquo;social justice activists&rdquo ; who are all impacting Biden&rsquo;s policies right now during an election year are opposed not only to Netanyahu but to Israel itself , regardless of who leads the country.In their minds , Israel is an instrument of white supremacy and imperialism , and regardless of the identity of the prime minister or composition of his government , the Jewish state would still be an illegitimate , racist , colonialist enterprise in their eyes.US officials were quoted as saying that Netanyahu&rsquo;s decision not to send Dermer and Hanegbi to Washington for consultations was motivated by political considerations . And they are probably right . Being seen as willing to stand up to US pressure plays well politically with Netanyahu&rsquo;s base.But there is something disingenuous in this criticism of Netanyahu for letting political considerations influence his policies . Are not political considerations now also heavily influencing Biden&rsquo;s policies in this crisis?Last month , the US vetoed a similar resolution at the Security Council calling for an immediate ceasefire . Why did it not do the same thing now ? What changed in the interim?Several things changed . Among them is that the casualty figures in Gaza continue to rise , and another is that Biden is getting pounded by progressive Democrats and Arab Americans for his support of Israel.Biden&rsquo;s tone and the tone of his administration have changed markedly in the last two months , and that has to do with Arab Americans voting & ndash ; or not voting & ndash ; in Michigan and with progressives unenthused by the Biden campaign , harshly critical of his Israel policy , and threatening either to vote for a third party candidate or stay at home on Election Day , November 5.Both Biden and Netanyahu are political animals , and both are using their disagreements for their own political purposes . But to say this is all Netanyahu&rsquo;s fault , and that Israel&rsquo;s position in the world and in Washington would be sterling even amid a war such as this if someone else were calling the shots in Jerusalem , is unrealistic.This doesn&rsquo;t mean that Netanyahu&rsquo;s handling of the relationship with the US during the war has been flawless . It most definitely has not.For example , Netanyahu could have played Monday&rsquo;s Security Council resolution completely differently & ndash ; accept a two-week ceasefire for the duration of Ramadan to win favor with the Biden administration and the world , and then resume fighting at the end of the Muslim holy month if Hamas did not release the hostages . At that point , Israel could say that it fulfilled the resolution , but Hamas did not & ndash ; placing the onus on the terrorist organization.Netanyahu could have done things differently , but not all the tensions in the relationship can be dumped on his doorstep . Netanyahu & ndash ; with all his faults & ndash ; is not always wrong , nor is Biden & ndash ; with all the support he has given Israel since October 7 & ndash ; always right , as various opposition leaders and leading voices in the media lamenting the current tension in the relationship would have one believe.Monday&rsquo;s Security Council resolution is a case in point .",us-israel tensions aren't all netanyahu's fault - analysis
2021-05-09 17:32:23.457,jpost,"The tensions and clashes in Jerusalem , particularly the videos from Friday night showing Israeli police in al-Aqsa Mosque , have led to the first condemnations of Israel from the country&rsquo;s new Gulf partners . & nbsp ; Bahrain condemned Israeli forces for the & ldquo;attack on worshipers at al-Aqsa Mosque . & rdquo ; The UAE has called on Israel to de-escalate tensions in Jerusalem and Sheikh Jarrah . & nbsp ; Bahrain also has been concerned about the evictions of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah . It doesn&rsquo;t want the peace process or stability in the region undermined , and it wants provocations to stop . It wants tensions reduced as Ramadan concludes after a difficult month of clashes . & nbsp ; The statements came as Saudi Arabia said it & ldquo;rejects Israel&rsquo;s plans and measures to evict dozens of Palestinians from their homes in Jerusalem and impose Israeli sovereignty over them . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The triumvirate of Saudi Arabia , Bahrain and the UAE is important because it is largely accepted that Riyadh gave the green light to Manama and Abu Dhabi to make peace last year . The Emirates went first , for various reasons , even though Bahrain had long considered a peace deal and was pushing coexistence for years . & nbsp ; The UAE made the first unprecedented flights with humanitarian aid during COVID-19 in the spring of 2020 . Then its ambassador to Washington , Yousef al-Otaiba , wrote an op-ed in Yediot Aharonot . Peace followed soon after as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed down from & ldquo;annexation&rdquo ; of the West Bank . & nbsp ; However , the peace deals , which moved quickly in August and September , hit some hurdles . There were questions about F-35 sales , and US president Donald Trump lost the election in the US . This took the wind out of the sails of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s considerations and of several other countries that might have jumped on the peace wagon . & nbsp ; There were considerations about reconciliation after years in which countries had a transactional relationship with the Trump administration . Under Trump , Washington had signaled that human rights were not an issue . There was no pressure on Israel regarding Palestinian issues . On the contrary , there was a & ldquo;peace to prosperity&rdquo ; plan . & nbsp ; The plan was unveiled on January 27 , 2020 , but aspects of it had been pushed in 2019 . The US Embassy had been moved in 2018 . Palestinians lost funding and were sidelined . The Jordanian king even went to Turkey for a meeting , and he had hoped Trump would reconsider the embassy move . & nbsp ; BY 2020 , things were moving in favor of the peace deals , with key work from Jared Kushner and Avi Berkowitz . But calculations have changed in 2021 . & nbsp ; Human-rights groups have made a new push to condemn Israel for & ldquo;apartheid . & rdquo ; There have been calls on the Biden administration to pressure Israel . Former CIA director John Brennan and others have led the push , along with critical voices in Congress . & nbsp ; Meanwhile , Netanyahu sought to fly to the UAE for a quick trip to show off the new relations while in the midst of an election campaign . Having twice canceled the trip during the pandemic , he had to cancel again on March 11 , claiming Jordan had prevented a stopover . Embarrassment followed as voices in the UAE expressed concern that they were being embroiled in Israeli politics . & nbsp ; Then came the Jerusalem tensions . Failed attempts at Palestinian elections and the beginning of Ramadan coincided with Israel&rsquo;s elections on March 23 . Ramadan began on April 21 , and with it came clashes . & nbsp ; Nevertheless , the positive relations with the Gulf have continued . UAE Ambassador to Israel Mohamed Al Khaja penned an op-ed at Yediot about his first month in Israel . & nbsp ; However , the scenes at al-Aqsa Mosque last Friday were the kind that cause tensions in the region . Iran , Hezbollah and Hamas had slammed Israel in the days leading up to the clashes . Turkey and Qatar were preparing statements to slam Israel . The US was expressing concern and demanding de-escalation . European countries were following the tensions closely . & nbsp ; Instead of listening and trying to reduce the clashes , Israeli security forces waded into them . Whether that was due to political uncertainty in Israel , with Netanyahu&rsquo;s rivals gaining in influence , or other issues was not clear . & nbsp ; The security cabinet met for the first time in months on April 18 . A new crisis after shooting attacks in the West Bank has led Israel to bolster forces . Hamas has fired rockets and threatens more . Israel is holding a large drill preparing for a multifront conflict . & nbsp ; COULD GULF ties be strained by this convergence of troubles ? So far , the statements are what was to be expected : concern and some mild condemnation ; a desire for stability and for Israel to listen . The question is whether Israel will listen . & nbsp ; Israel&rsquo;s relatively cold official relations with Jordan and Egypt , combined with good security relations that largely go unnoticed , are the opposite of the positive ties and human-to-human connections with the Gulf that saw Israelis flock to the region to take part in conferences and discuss business deals . & nbsp ; However , voices in the UAE cautioned Israel about expecting too much and moving too fast . They certainly were wary of being used for a two-hour photo op by Netanyahu before an election . & nbsp ; Some Israeli right-wing voices in Israel , accustomed to slamming Arab states and never listening to regional voices , have paid lip service to peace with the Gulf . But they still show little interest in listening or taking to heart the need to reduce tensions in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Outside of the statements and Jerusalem clashes , Israel and its peace partners in the Gulf have much to work on regarding wider issues , such as regional strategy and ties with Greece . There are new deals and initiatives moving forward . & nbsp ; There is coexistence . However , the Jerusalem tensions are the kind that require sensitive handling and showing respect for the concerns of others , a type of language that Jerusalem has not often used in recent years . & nbsp ; With a new administration in the White House , electoral uncertainty in Israel , and Iran , Turkey , Hamas and Hezbollah chomping at the bit for a showdown with the Jewish state , many challenges are in the air , of which the Gulf&rsquo;s concerns about Jerusalem are just one .",could jerusalem crisis put strain on israel-gulf ties ? - analysis

The protesters have also demanded that those responsible for the death of Banat be brought to justice . & nbsp ; The visit also comes amid a stepped-up crackdown by PA security forces on political activists , social media users and journalists in the West Bank . & nbsp ; The Representative Office of Canada in Ramallah last week said it was & ldquo;deeply concerned by the attacks on Palestinians protesting the death of Nizar Banat , as well as the unacceptable attacks on journalists covering the protests . & rdquo ; It called on the PA to take immediate steps to ensure that freedoms of assembly and expression are respected and protected . & nbsp ; Abbas told Garneau that the Palestinians are prepared to return to the political process with Israel & ldquo;to end the occupation and achieve comprehensive peace , in accordance with international resolutions , under the auspices of the Quartet&rdquo ; members & ndash ; the US , Russia , the United Nations and the European Union . & nbsp ; Abbas stressed the importance of having a political horizon and giving hope to the Palestinians , according to the PA&rsquo;s official news agency WAFA . & nbsp ; It said that Abbas emphasized the need to expedite the process of rebuilding the Gaza Strip and providing aid to the Palestinians . & nbsp ; Abbas told Garneau that the PA government in Ramallah is prepared to contribute to the reconstruction effort and work towards ending the division between the West Bank and the Hamas-ruled coastal enclave . & nbsp ; He also expressed appreciation for Canada&rsquo;s support & ldquo;for the right of the Palestinians to self-determination , its opposition to settlement expansion , its refusal to expel Palestinians from their homes in east Jerusalem , and its repeated calls for respecting the historical situation in religious sites , & rdquo ; WAFA added . & nbsp ; Abbas also thanked Canada for the humanitarian aid it provides to the Gaza Strip , the support provided to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees ( UNRWA ) , and its assistance in combating the coronavirus epidemic . & nbsp ; Abbas told his Canadian guest that he will call new general elections as soon as Israel agrees to allow a vote in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; In April , Abbas called off the parliamentary and presidential elections that were supposed to take place respectively on May 22 and July 31 , under the pretext that Israel did not reply to the Palestinians&rsquo ; request to hold the elections in Jerusalem . & nbsp ; WAFA quoted Garneau as saying that Canada was opposed to the & ldquo;expulsion of Palestinian residents from their homes in east Jerusalem and the importance of respecting religious sites , & rdquo ; as well as its rejection of settlements . & nbsp ; Garneau also expressed Canada&rsquo;s keenness to establish peace in the region , its commitment to achieving peace based on the principle of the two-state solution , establishing security and stability and continuing to provide relief and assistance to UNRWA , the agency said . & nbsp ; PA Foreign Minister Riyad Malki , who also met with Garneau , accused Israel of & ldquo;waging war&rdquo ; on Palestinians in Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank , which is exclusively controlled by Israel .

2021-10-28 20:51:20.727,jpost,"The decision by the Defense Ministry to designate six Palestinian NGOs as arms of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine terrorist organization quickly developed into an international storm , with the US , the UN and the EU raising objections and questioning the validity of the move . & nbsp ; On Monday , European Union Representative to the Palestinians Sven K&uuml;hn Von Burgsdorff visited the six Palestinian NGOs Defense Minister Benny Gantz had targeted . On Wednesday , representatives of 25 Israeli nongovernmental groups paid a solidarity visit to the Al-Haq office in Ramallah to voice their opposition to the designation . Two divergent narratives emerged in the wake of the decision . In one reality resides Gantz , the Defense Ministry and pro-Israel NGOs , subscribed to the reality that long-ignored terrorist activity cynically cloaked in the guise of human rights has finally been unmasked . The other narrative considers the six NGOs to be human rights organizations and considers the designation to be a draconian attack on Palestinian civil society . & nbsp ; On one side , you have Prof . Gerald M . Steinberg , president and founder of NGO Monitor , who says : & ldquo;There&rsquo;s no justification for not considering or ignoring or overlooking the terrorist connections . These are not trivial . People & ndash ; Israelis & ndash ; have been killed . & rdquo ; On the other side , there&rsquo;s Samer Sinijlawi , chairman of the Jerusalem Development Fund and Fatah activist from Jerusalem , who says : & ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a blind war against all voices that are criticizing the occupation and the abuse of the human rights of the Palestinians . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Which reality is true ? Is Israel trying to suppress Palestinian civil society , or is it a legitimate grievance against terrorist organizations ? After reviewing the importance of the NGOs and their terrorism connections , where one falls seems to be a matter of priorities . PFLP affiliation The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine is a Marxist military group recognized as a terrorist group by most of the Western world . & nbsp ; Israel claims that Addameer , Al-Haq , Bisan Center , Defense for Children International & ndash ; Palestine ( DCI-P ) , Union of Agricultural Work Committees ( UAWC ) and the Union of Palestinian Women&rsquo;s Committees ( UPWC ) are part of a PFLP terrorist network that recruits , provides legitimacy to operatives , and serves as a leadership wing for the PFLP . They&rsquo;ve been accused of funneling funding to terrorism through forgery , laundering , and the awarding of stipends to the families of terrorists . & nbsp ; The government hasn&rsquo;t provided much information to prove its allegations . But little has been done to dispute them other than to note the groups&rsquo ; statuses as human rights NGOs . This leaves everyone else to make sense of the diverging realities . The NGOs have rejected the claims , but groups like NGO Monitor assert that there is enough open source documentation to prove that the only thing under attack is terrorism . Al-Haq Established in 1979 and based in Ramallah , Al-Haq is an award-winning NGO with connections with dozens of international human right bodes , which describes itself as a human rights NGO that & ldquo;documents violations of the individual and collective rights of Palestinians . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Al-Haq was the first NGO that drew Steinberg&rsquo;s suspicion of PFLP connections , & ldquo;and in many ways is the most significant , of the ones that were recently designated as terrorist organizations , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;Al-Haq is headed by Shawan Jabarin , who sat in Israeli jail for a while , was convicted of being an activist member of the PFLP , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo;The court ruled that he is a human rights worker by day and a terrorist official by night . & rdquo ; According to NGO Monitor , in 2018 , Visa , Mastercard , and American Express shut down online donations to Al-Haq due to PFLP ties . Al-Haq asserted in a statement that the & ldquo;baseless allegations&rdquo ; seek & ldquo;to delegitimize , oppress , silence&rdquo ; Palestinian NGOs . It argued that the decision is not based on security concerns , but comes due to & ldquo;the opening of an International Criminal Court investigation . & rdquo ; Sinijlawi finds it suspicious that & ldquo;these organizations are leading the procedure in the ICC , where Gantz himself is the main target because he has been the chief of staff in 2014 . & rdquo ; DCI-P Founded in 1991 , DCI-P is a Palestinian child rights organization that provides legal support to Palestinian minors in the Israeli and military court systems . & ldquo;We reject the recent designation as another unjust action by Israeli authorities to criminalize and eliminate our lawful human rights and child protection work , & rdquo ; said Khaled Quzmar , general director of Defense for Children International & ndash ; Palestine . & ldquo;When years of delegitimization and disinformation campaigns against us have failed to silence our work , Israeli authorities now choose to escalate repressive tactics by labeling civil society organizations as terrorists . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We&rsquo;ve identified five or six different people at different levels of the organization that had been active in the PFLP , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo;One in particular was the coordinator of DCI-P&rsquo;s Community Mobilization Unit , Hashem Abu Maria . & rdquo ; Abu Maria was killed in a clash with the IDF in 2014 and , according to NGO Monitor , was called & ldquo;a leader&rdquo ; by PFLP . The designation is not the first time that DCI-P has faced charges of terrorism . Citibank and Arab Bank PLC reportedly ceased providing services to DCI-P over PFLP links in 2018 . Addameer The Addameer Prisoner Support and Human Rights Association , established in 1991 , works and advocates for Palestinians in Israeli prisons , & ldquo;offers free legal aid to political prisoners , & rdquo ; and runs social campaigns . & ldquo;They defend mostly PFLP , the people who are accused in the Israeli legal process , & rdquo ; Steinberg noted . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The designations represent an unprecedented & amp ; ominous attempt by the Israeli occupying authorities to silence and criminalize Palestinian CSOs that challenge Israel&rsquo;s prolonged military occupation , & rdquo ; Addameer tweeted . According to Steinberg , Addameer & ldquo;have a number of staff members who are connected to PFLP . The founder , ( Abdul-Latif Ghait ) was a member and activist . The former vice chairman . . . Khalida Jarrar . . . she is defined as the head of the PFLP operations in the West Bank . & rdquo ; NGO Monitor claims to have identified at least five other PFLP members in Addameer&rsquo;s ranks . Bisan Center The Bisan Center for Research and Development specializes in socioeconomic rights and community engagement . & nbsp ; & ldquo;It should be noted that Bisan Center for Research and Development is an independent , nonpartisan center that is not affiliated with any political entity , & rdquo ; Bisan said in a statement on its Facebook page . & ldquo;This announcement [ of the terrorist designation ] comes after concerted efforts in the Israeli occupation&rsquo;s attempts in a defamation campaign led by the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs , & rdquo ; it continued . & ldquo;The most recent [ Bisan ] executive director . . . was sentenced for 12 months for recruiting activists , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & nbsp ; Ataraf Rimawi , identified by NGO Monitor as Bisan&rsquo;s previous executive director , was noted in a court ruling as a & ldquo;PFLP member&rdquo ; who & ldquo;posed a security threat . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; UPWC The UPWC is & ldquo;a progressive mass feminist organization that was established in 1980 , & rdquo ; according to its website . & ldquo;And they have five individuals that we&rsquo;ve identified on the payroll as PFLP people , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo;One of the founders of the PFLP . . . was the president of the UPWC . So again , the connection there is pretty strong between [ the UPWC and ] the PFLP . & rdquo ; Israel is not the first to identify UPWC as a PFLP arm . In 2015 , Fatah identified the UPWC as a PFLP affiliate , as did USAID in 1993 . UAWC Among the largest agricultural institutions in Palestinian society , UAWC was established in 1986 to promote Palestinian agricultural development . & ldquo;They run agricultural projects in Gaza and in the West Bank , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo;And that&rsquo;s their excuse . That&rsquo;s the justification for the large amounts of funding . They get millions from many different European countries . & rdquo ; & ldquo;UAWC rejects and condemns Israel&rsquo;s unsubstantiated allegations directed at UAWC and the other NGOs , which are politically motivated . It is telling that the Israeli government refuses to release any & lsquo;evidence&rsquo ; substantiating these allegations , & rdquo ; the NGO told The Jerusalem Post . & ldquo;We have identified seven [ PFLP-affiliated ] individuals that have various positions [ in UAWC ] , & rdquo ; said Steinberg . & ldquo;A number of them have been sentenced in Israel , and , of course , Samir Arbid is standing trial ; he was their accountant . & rdquo ; Arbid and Razak Farraj , another UAWC member , were arrested for their roles in the 2019 terrorist attack that killed Rina Schnerb . & ldquo;There are hundreds of employees who have worked and continue to work at UAWC and thousands of volunteers , & rdquo ; said a UAWC representative . & ldquo;UAWC , like any other organization , is not responsible for any individual action of any former and current employees . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We should not forget that Arbid and Farraj have been exposed to horrifying torture to pressure them to give confessions , & rdquo ; said the representative . As with UPWC , Fatah and USAID documented that UAWC is a PFLP affiliate . NGO Monitor has further noted that due to Arbid&rsquo;s and Farraj&rsquo;s affiliations , the Netherlands suspended funding to the organization . & nbsp ; The UAWC representative asserted that the funding was suspended only because of & ldquo;NGO Monitor&rsquo;s large incitement campaigns against UAWC . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The representative dismissed the USAID designation , saying that the USAID & ldquo;report [ in which UAWC was designated a PFLP affiliate ] was published before the arrival of the Palestinian Authority , and it is a report that talks about the beginnings of UAWC and its work , which was all voluntary . & rdquo ; A few bad eggs ? The main evidence for proponents of the designation doesn&rsquo;t come from the government , but from NGO investigations showing overlap of PFLP members within civil society . & nbsp ; Sinijlawi argues that there are a few flaws in perceiving NGOs as terrorist organizations based on a few individuals . The NGO could be unaware it has terrorists in its ranks . & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that , by law , any NGO needs to get a security clearance for any person to get employed . If somebody submits the CV and he&rsquo;s qualified for a job , he gets it . & rdquo ; Even if the NGOs were aware , while some countries do not differentiate between military and political wings , these NGOs may have . & ldquo;There could be a military wing inside the Popular Front , but it does not mean that every student activist . . . is involved in a certain type of violence or military action . & rdquo ; While some of the NGOs may have had violent actors , & ldquo;it does not mean that this organization is totally involved into terrorism , & rdquo ; said Sinijlawi . & ldquo;To blame the whole people because of someone related directly or indirectly to these NGOs . . . it&rsquo;s a trick that anybody will buy . & rdquo ; & ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just that they&rsquo;re members . . . it&rsquo;s high-level staff , & rdquo ; said Steinberg , dismissing that it&rsquo;s a few bad eggs & ndash ; & ldquo;in some cases , the heads of the organization , the people who control the money . & rdquo ; Besides the pattern of NGO employees being PFLP operatives , Steinberg noted , PFLP/NGO activists often hold multiple positions in different NGOs , including in umbrella organizations . & ldquo;There&rsquo;s a broader framework called PNGO , Palestinian NGO umbrella Organization . These organizations are all members of the PNGO , and the head of the PNGO generally has been a PFLP official . & rdquo ; NGO or terrorism ? & ldquo;What does anybody mean by Palestinian & lsquo;civil society , & rsquo ; particularly when these organizations are very clearly part of a network which is not just terrorists , but it&rsquo;s also part of the PLO structure ? & rdquo ; Steinberg asks . & ldquo;What makes these organizations civil society ? & rdquo ; The NGOs & ldquo;are very important for Palestinians , & rdquo ; said Sinijlawi . The designation is tantamount to & ldquo;shutting down the democratic dynamics inside Palestinian society . & rdquo ; On its part , PFLP has not disputed its connection to the NGOs . & nbsp ; PFLP political bureau&rsquo;s Kayed al-Ghoul has said that Palestinians are & ldquo;proud of the affiliation of any of their sons with any national faction that resists the occupation , including the&rdquo ; PFLP . The negative reaction to the terrorism designations shows how important these organizations are to Palestinians and their allies . & nbsp ; Years of terrorist activity in the midst of Palestinian NGOs shows that when it comes to terrorists in their ranks , the prevailing sentiment in the response from the international community , Palestinian activists , and international bodies is that you need to break a few bad eggs to make an omelet . The two realities may not be so irreconcilable . The NGOs and the terrorist groups are interconnected , and while Palestinian civil society may be under attack & ndash ; that may also be legitimate . & bull ;",palestinian ngos : human rights workers or agents of terror ?
2023-07-04 20:39:26.083,jpost,"One recipe for a successful military operation is to clearly define goals beforehand , accomplish them , and then end the operation before expanding those goals and risking getting bogged down.As of Tuesday evening , Operation Home and Garden & ndash ; based on these criteria & ndash ; can be considered successful.The stated goal was to target the terrorist infrastructure in Jenin and degrade the terrorists&rsquo ; capabilities.The IDF successfully knocked out terrorist command centers , uncovered weapons labs and arms stockpiles , killed nearly a dozen terrorists , and apprehended 10 times that number . It also signaled that it was ready to end the operation swiftly.The success of the campaignThe campaign seemed successful at an operational and tactical level : well planned and effectively executed , with no IDF fatalities as of Tuesday evening and minimal harm to non-combatants.Prevention needs to be the next goalBut what comes next ? What happens the day after the troops leave Jenin ? This question can be divided into two parts : operational and strategic.Operationally , once the IDF leaves Jenin , it must prevent the terrorists from rebuilding the infrastructure there and posing a threat to the country . It must prevent them from building workshops for producing roadside bombs and labs for manufacturing primitive rockets . & nbsp;The IDF also needs to prevent the Jenin refugee camp from again becoming a sanctuary for terrorists carrying out attacks on the roads in Judea and Samaria.The relatively small number of terrorists killed or apprehended in this operation & ndash ; the IDF has identified an additional 350 armed terrorist gunmen in the city beyond the 120 arrested & ndash ; indicates that they evaded the IDF soldiers . They hid but did not vanish , and once the IDF leaves they are likely to be even more motivated to carry out attacks.To prevent the terrorists from launching attacks or rebuilding the terrorist infrastructure , the IDF will need to go back into Jenin again and again . This cannot be a one-time operation because its effectiveness would rapidly diminish.In a perfect world , or at least in a world run according to agreements reached under the Oslo Accords , the Palestinian Authority security apparatus would be doing this job . But because the PA security apparatus is not fulfilling its responsibilities , & nbsp;the IDF has to operate in its place . This means the IDF will need to go into Jenin more frequently to keep the terrorists from having freedom of movement and action.After the IDF withdraws from Jenin , the security forces must brace for retaliatory attacks of the kind carried out by a lone terrorist in Tel Aviv on Tuesday afternoon.Additionally , they must be prepared for Jewish revenge attacks in response to these terror attacks . Such actions , like the rampages by Jewish extremists in Palestinian towns following the murders outside of Eli two weeks ago and in Huwara earlier this year , are not only morally reprehensible and wrong but also sap international legitimacy for the types of military actions taken by Israel in Jenin , and which may become more frequent.As Israel takes actions to prevent the buildup of terrorist networks in the West Bank , encouraged and supported by Iran , Hamas , and Hezbollah , it must also be ready to strike at targets in Gaza and Lebanon if terrorist organizations there launch rockets toward Israel in a show of solidarity with Jenin . That the recent fighting did not spread to other fronts this time does not guarantee the same outcome if similar actions are taken in the future.Israel needs to define strategic goalsAll that is on the tactical and operational level.On a strategic level , Israel needs to define its goals . While the IDF spokesman clarified Operation Home and Garden&rsquo;s goals over the last few days , emphasizing that the aim was to target the terrorist infrastructure without occupying and remaining in Jenin , a similar diplomatic goal was not articulated.The IDF wants to degrade the terrorist organization&rsquo;s capabilities in Jenin , but what happens afterward ? What is Israel&rsquo;s vision for Jenin ? Does it want the Palestinian Authority to regain control of the city ? If so , what political , diplomatic , or financial incentives is it willing to give the Palestinian Authority to motivate it to reassert its control?In addition , Israel must determine how far it is willing to go and what actions it is prepared to take to weaken Hamas , which is the Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s main rival.During a Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee meeting last month , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that while Israel wants to eliminate the Palestinian aspiration for statehood , it & ldquo;needs&rdquo ; the Palestinian Authority and cannot & ldquo;allow it to collapse . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We are prepared to help it financially . We have an interest in the Palestinian Authority continuing to work , & rdquo ; he said.Following the Jenin operation , Netanyahu must define what exactly that means and outline the steps he is willing to take to strengthen the PA so it will have incentives to regain security control in areas like Jenin.When Naftali Bennett was prime minister in 2021 , he spoke of & ldquo;shrinking the conflict&rdquo ; with the Palestinians . This meant increasing Palestinian sovereignty through building a network of roadblock-free roads controlled by the Palestinians , expanding Palestinian housing and infrastructure , implementing measures to boost the Palestinian economy , and decreasing Israel&rsquo;s footprint in Palestinian-controlled areas.Although this fell far short of the Palestinian aspiration for statehood , it was something.So far , the Netanyahu government has not held out any diplomatic horizon for the Palestinians , and instead has approved thousands of new housing units in the settlements and green-lighted an expedited planning process for more.This reflects internal divisions within the government . While Netanyahu speaks of not wanting to bring about the collapse of the Palestinian Authority or annexing the West Bank , other voices & ndash ; such as those of Bezalel Smotrich & ndash ; advocate the opposite.Following the events in Jenin , Netanyahu needs to decide what the government wants . If the aim is to collaborate with the Palestinian Authority , actions should be taken to strengthen it and weaken its enemies . But if the goal is to undermine the Palestinian Authority , Israel should begin preparing to fill the void created when the PA collapses . This week&rsquo;s actions in Jenin offer a glimpse of what may await throughout Judea and Samaria if this is the chosen course . & nbsp ;",jenin operation : what is meant to happen next ? - analysis

Settlers overnight attacked the nearby Palestinian town of Turmus Ayya setting homes and cars ablaze . One Palestinian man was killed during the violence . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We strongly condemn yesterday&rsquo;s terror attack&rdquo ; outside Eli , Patel said , adding that there is & ldquo;no justification for terrorism . & rdquo;Overall , he said , & ldquo;We are deeply concerned by the rising levels of violence in the West Bank in recent months . & rdquo ; "" We are deeply concerned by the rising levels of violence in the West Bank in recent months "" & nbsp;State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant PatelBut his harshest words were for the settler attack . He welcomed the IDF condemnation , but said that the US expects & ldquo;the Israeli government to ensure accountability and legal prosecution for those responsible for these attacks in addition to compensation for lost homes and property . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Netanyahu issued a strong statement against the violent settler attack , emphasizing , & ldquo;There are days when we must state what is self-evident : The State of Israel is a nation of laws . All citizens of Israel are obligated to obey the law . & rdquo;He specifically mentioned that the statement applied to the West Bank.Netanyahu approves 1,000 new settler homes in response to terrorThe Eli attack had already prompted a response from Netanyahu&rsquo;s office which announced Israel&rsquo;s intention to advance plans for 1,000 new homes Eli . "" Our answer to terrorism is to strike it hard and build our country , & rdquo ; Netanyahu&rsquo;s office stated.Netanyahu approved the move together with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , who holds a ministerial position in the Defense Ministry.Patel spoke out against the move . & ldquo;Unilateral action such as settlement advancement will only incite tensions and undermine the prospect of a two-state solution , & rdquo ; he stated.Those units would be in addition to the 4,560 new homes the Civil Administration&rsquo;s Higher Planning Council plans to advance when it convenes later this month . It is expected to approve the deposit of a plan for 500 new homes in Eli.The construction of 1,500 units would more than double the size of the community , which according to the Central Bureau of Statistics had a population of 4,613 in 2021 . & nbsp;Eli is located close to 24 kilometers over the pre-1967 lines , off of Route 60 in the Binyamin region . Like all of the West Bank settlements , former US President Donald Trump&rsquo;s peace plan drew it into the section of Area C over which Israel would eventually be allowed to apply sovereignty.It is , however , outside the boundaries of the security barrier . The international community and the Israeli Left hold that it is an isolated settlement outside the blocs and located so deep into the West Bank that its presence makes it more difficult to create a viable Palestinian state in Area C.The international community had already condemned Israel this week over the intention to advance 4,560 homes and the amendment to a 1996 government decision that would fast-track the approval process for settler building projects.Separately settler families returned to the Evyatar outpost in the Samaria region of the West Bank , a fledgling hilltop community they voluntarily abandoned two years ago after striking an agreement with the government that the hilltop would be legalized as a new settlement starting with the approval for the construction of a yeshiva at the site.To date , neither the previous government or the existing one has kept their pledge in that regard.Yesha Council head Shlomo Ne&rsquo;eman said of the new building announcement , & ldquo;To those who wish us harm , know that we are here to stay . Terrorism will not defeat us . We will continue to live and flourish in the land of our ancestors . & rdquo;While the international attention which had at first focused on condemning the Eli terror attack turned to statements against settlement building and violence , Israel&rsquo;s Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan called for the Security Council to condemn the Eli attack and hold the Palestinian Authority accountable for inciting terror . & ldquo;Heinous attacks&rdquo ; such as what happened in Eli & ldquo;are a direct result of deliberate incitement by Palestinian terror organizations , as well as the Palestinian Authority , which continues to finance the salaries of murderers and their families through the Palestinian Authority&rsquo;s despicable & lsquo;pay-for-slay&rsquo ; policy&rdquo ; by which stipends are giving to terrorists and their families.This & ldquo;stands in clear contravention of international law concerning the financing of terrorism .

2022-05-13 13:03:44.533,jpost,"The tragic death of veteran Al Jazeera reporter Shireen Abu Akleh in Jenin on Wednesday morning came as Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh was visiting Brussels , where he attended a meeting of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee , a body whose primary function is to coordinate the delivery of international aid to the Palestinians.Established in 1993 , the AHLC has been meeting at least twice a year under the chairmanship of Norway.This year&rsquo;s meeting came amid reports that some of the Western donor countries were refusing to provide additional financial aid to the PA unless it implements major reforms , especially in the field of education . The proposed reforms basically call for changes in the Palestinian school textbooks , which are written by PA professionals whose salaries are directly funded by the European Union.Shtayyeh went to the meeting with the hope of convincing the donors that the PA was serious about implementing large-scale reforms not only in the education sector , but in other fields , too.And as in previous meetings , Shtayyeh used the platform to launch a scathing attack on Israel , accusing it of engaging in a & ldquo;systematic destruction of the two-state solution by allowing settlers to invade the Aqsa Mosque , preventing Palestinians from entering Jerusalem , in addition to field executions and arrests . & rdquo;Referring to the severe financial crisis in the PA , the PA premier said that the Palestinians have started recovering from the coronavirus pandemic crisis , and that the Gross Domestic Product rose about 7 % in 2021 . & ldquo;The Palestinian economy suffers from a defect in its structure , & rdquo ; Shtayyeh told the donors . & ldquo;It is a besieged economy that does not control its resources or capabilities , and it exists in an exceptional situation imposed by the reality of the occupation and its procedures . & rdquo;He revealed that the rate of unemployment decreased in the last quarter of 2021 to 13 % , after having reached 18 % in 2019 . This , Shtayyeh said , was due to new job opportunities in the West Bank and work in Israel.A report submitted to the AHLC by the Quartet , which consists of the US , EU , United Nations and Russia , noted that the PA continues to face a dire financial situation resulting from diminished economic growth , a marked decline in donor funding and Israeli deductions from clearance revenue ( in response to payments made by the PA to families of Palestinians involved in terrorist attacks against Israelis ) . In 2021 , the PA&rsquo;s deficit reached $ 757 million & ndash ; approximately 4.4 % of GDP & ndash ; despite GDP growth of 6 % , an increase in gross local revenues of $ 1.5 billion and a decrease in government expenditure . During the same year , deductions by Israel from clearance revenues reached $ 282m . , representing 37 % of the budgetary deficit . & ldquo;Projections for 2022 by the PA portray a similarly grim fiscal situation , & rdquo ; according to the Quartet report . & ldquo;Despite projecting 3 % growth in GDP and 8 % in gross revenues , the PA&rsquo;s fiscal deficit is expected to reach $ 558m . Addressing that gap will require structural change , internal fiscal reform , improved economic growth , and the resolution of a number of long-discussed but still outstanding Israeli-Palestinian fiscal files . & rdquo;Shtayyeh presented to the donors a plan that includes 21 steps for reforms related to administrative , financial , security , social and economic issues . & ldquo;Whatever reforms we make , they alone are not sufficient to address the imbalance in the Palestinian economic structure , because it is under occupation , & rdquo ; he argued . & ldquo;Therefore , Israel must take measures on its part , and the support of donor countries must continue to enable us to continue fulfilling our obligations . & rdquo;Shtayyeh did not refer to the issue of anti-Israel incitement . But the plan he presented to the donor countries argued that , as part of the reform process , the PA will work toward promoting and protecting the Palestinian national narrative and culture . & ldquo;Information about Palestine is being deliberately distorted by the Israeli occupying authorities , and , as part of this process , Palestinian folklore , heritage and archaeological artifacts are being stolen , & rdquo ; the plan stated . & ldquo;A battle is being waged over the narrative dominating the conflict . It is important that our national culture , grounded on the Palestinian identity , should be consolidated and protected . & rdquo;THE NEWS OF Abu Akleh&rsquo;s death came as Shtayyeh was meeting with Roberta Metsola , president of the European Parliament , and other EU officials on the sidelines of the AHLC meeting.The widespread condemnations of the incident have since been used by Shtayyeh and other Palestinian officials to garner additional support for the Palestinians&rsquo ; case , promote the Palestinian narrative , and shift the blame onto Israel . The ultimate goal : to ramp up the narrative according to which the Palestinians are the & ldquo;victims of the Israeli occupation . & rdquo;In a statement from Brussels , Shtayyeh wrote that & ldquo;Shireen was killed by the Israeli occupation while documenting their horrific crimes against our people . & rdquo;He later urged the senior EU officials to pressure Israel & ldquo;to stop all its unilateral measures and violations against our people and to allow the holding of elections in occupied Jerusalem . & rdquo;It&rsquo;s not clear at this stage whether Shtayyeh was successful in persuading the donor countries to resume or increase their financial aid to the Palestinians . The killing of Abu Akleh may significantly contribute to the Palestinians&rsquo ; diplomatic and media warfare against Israel , but it will not necessarily bring more money into the coffers of the PA.The Europeans and other Western donors have , at least in the past few years , been exerting heavy pressure on the PA to end the incitement and tone down its rhetoric against Israel.For now , it&rsquo;s evident that the pressure has proven to be ineffective.In fact , it seems that matters have been going in the opposite direction . The voices and messages emanating from Ramallah and the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip have become even more toxic , as evidenced before and during Ramadan.Allegations that Jewish settlers are & ldquo;storming&rdquo ; and & ldquo;desecrating&rdquo ; the Aqsa Mosque during their tours of the Temple Mount are sounded almost every day in the West Bank and Gaza Strip . Senior PA and Hamas officials don&rsquo;t miss an opportunity to accuse Israel of planning to & ldquo;commit crimes&rdquo ; against one of Islam&rsquo;s holiest sites , Jerusalem , and the Palestinian people.Against this backdrop , terrorist attacks were carried out in Beersheba , Bnei Brak , Tel Aviv , Elad and Jerusalem . The attacks , which resulted in the deaths of 19 people , are said to be connected , directly and indirectly , to the tensions at the Temple Mount and Jerusalem.Yet , just as the tensions and violence appeared to be fading away , the incident involving the popular Al Jazeera journalist took Israel and the Palestinians back to square one . The PA , Hamas and other Palestinian factions and parties are now using the tragedy to further whip up anti-Israel sentiment among the Palestinians.The protests against the killing of Abu Akleh are likely to continue in the coming days and weeks . The protests , which coincide with the first anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war , could escalate during the Palestinians&rsquo ; annual commemoration of Nakba Day on May 15 in protest against the establishment of Israel.The PA is now hoping to turn the tragedy of the reporter into a new version of the incident involving Mohammed al-Durrah , the 12-year-old boy who was killed in the Gaza Strip in 2000 after being caught in a crossfire between the IDF and Palestinian security forces.The main goal is to increase the international pressure on Israel to halt all its practices in Jerusalem and the West Bank , including construction in the settlements and security measures at the Temple Mount.The PA&rsquo;s efforts are directed mainly toward the US and the EU.PA President Mahmoud Abbas wants the Biden administration to & ldquo;end its silence&rdquo ; and increase its involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.He wants the Biden administration to exert crushing pressure on the Israeli government to stop all IDF & ldquo;incursions&rdquo ; into Palestinian cities and villages . He also wants the Biden administration to fulfill all its promises to the Palestinians , especially the commitment to the reopening of the US Consulate in Jerusalem.On the other hand , Abbas and his officials want the EU and other Western donors to unconditionally resume their financial aid to the PA.Meanwhile , there&rsquo;s growing concern in Ramallah over the rising influence and popularity of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in the West Bank . While it&rsquo;s true that the IDF crackdown on Hamas and PIJ members serves the interests of Abbas , it nevertheless underscores the weakness and alleged collaboration of the PA with Israel . Each IDF operation and each killing of a Palestinian further erodes the Palestinian public&rsquo;s confidence in Abbas and the PA.For now , all eyes in Ramallah are set on the upcoming visit of Biden to the region.The PA is hoping that Biden will carry with him a number of gifts for the Palestinians . The talk about the possibility that the US president may visit a hospital in east Jerusalem without the presence of Israeli security officers has already sent a positive message to the PA & ndash ; namely , that the US considers east Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.But the PA knows that a visit to a hospital carries more symbolism than substance , which is why Abbas has made it clear that he expects the Biden administration to & ldquo;translate its words into deeds&rdquo ; and fulfill all its promises to the Palestinians without delay.Abbas&rsquo;s main message to the Americans and Europeans is : Submit to my demands , or the Palestinian Authority will collapse , and you will have a Hamas takeover of the West Bank .",pa is ramping up the ' victims of the israeli occupation ' narrative
2024-05-19 17:38:24.083,jpost,"A convention hosted by Vox , Spain&rsquo;s far-right party that has been criticized for welcoming neo-Nazis , counts Israel&rsquo;s Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli among its featured speakers this weekend.Chikli is appearing at Europa Viva 24 , a conference joining Europe&rsquo;s right-wing leaders and more than 10,000 attendees on Saturday and Sunday in Madrid . For Chikli , a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s right-wing Likud party , it&rsquo;s the latest stop in a tour of engagements with European politicians who advocate pro-Israel positions from parties with antisemitic and neo-Nazi roots.Both Chikli and Javier Milei , Argentina&rsquo;s new right-wing , pro-Israeli president , were invited to address the conference . In his speech , Chikli lambasted Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez , who has sharply criticized Israel&rsquo;s war against Hamas , which Chikli called & ldquo;an existential battle for the future of humanity . & rdquo;In Spain , Vox is controversial both for its platform & mdash ; which includes restricting abortion access , repealing domestic violence laws , and shuttering the ministry of equality & mdash ; and for a history of neo-Nazis in its ranks . Five years ago , the party nominated Holocaust revisionist Fernando Paz as a congressional candidate . Paz has said the facts of the Holocaust are & ldquo;far from being established with accuracy&rdquo ; and called the Nuremberg trials a & ldquo;farce . & rdquo;Vox is also home to Jordi de la Fuente , a member of the Barcelona government who previously led the neo-fascist Republican Social Movement , which dissolved in 2018 . Other Vox members have included Jos&eacute ; Mar&iacute;a Ruiz Puerta , who led the neo-Nazi group CEDADE , and Jos&eacute ; Ignacio Vega Peinado , who was part of the neo-Nazi group Radical Action in the 1990s and received prison time for attacking and permanently disabling a professor at the University of Valencia.Pedro Valera , a leader of Spanish neo-Nazism who has served jail time for disseminating hate speech , also recently appeared at Vox&rsquo;s closing campaign ceremony in Barcelona.Until recently , officials in the Likud party were discouraged from promoting alliances with Vox . In 2019 , Netanyahu&rsquo;s then-foreign affairs director Eli Hazan tweeted his support for the party and faced enough backlash to delete and apologize for the post.Growing ties between Israel's Likud and Spain's Vox parties&nbsp;But those boundaries have disappeared under Israel&rsquo;s current right-wing government . In December , Chikli met with Vox president Santiago Abascal , whom he called & ldquo;a man of truth who , in the twilight of Western civilization , where moral relativism threatens to collapse it , stands as a beacon of moral clarity . & rdquo;Last month , Chikli attended CPAC Hungary and praised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as a & ldquo;supporter of Israel . & rdquo ; ( The authoritarian leader has been condemned by US antisemitism envoy Deborah Lipstadt for & ldquo;rhetoric that clearly evokes Nazi racial ideology , & rdquo ; as well as by Hungarian rabbis . ) Chikli spoke alongside Tom Van Grieken , president of Belgium&rsquo;s Vlaams Belang party , which promotes the & ldquo;Great Replacement&rdquo ; conspiracy theory and uses the Nazi term & ldquo;omvolking&rdquo ; ( & ldquo;repopulation&rdquo ; ) , mainly referring to European immigration from Muslim countries.Chikli also met earlier this year with Sweden&rsquo;s far-right party , the Swedish Democrats . The second-largest party in the Swedish parliament , it has a history of Nazi founders and its members have been criticized for connections with neo-Nazi movements even in recent years . Israel has so far avoided establishing official ties with the party , but the Swedish Democrats & nbsp;have declared it & ldquo;the most pro-Israel party in Sweden . & rdquo;Chikli&rsquo;s ministry is charged with engaging and supporting the half of Jews who do not live in Israel ; he added fighting antisemitism to its mandate when he assumed the position last year . But while Chikli is strengthening his bond with far-right European parties , he has said that he is not interested in building a relationship with some Jews around the world.In January , at a conference hosted by the European Jewish Association in Krakow , Chikli said his official capacity would not induce him to build alliances with Diaspora Jews who participate in international protests against Israel&rsquo;s military assault in Gaza . & ldquo;A Jew who feels at home surrounded by a mob that is shouting , & lsquo;From the river to the sea , Palestine will be free , & rsquo ; I don&rsquo;t consider him a Jew , & rdquo ; Chikli told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency . & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to build a bridge with him . & rdquo ;",israeli minister addresses convention hosted by spanish far-right party with neo-nazi ties
2024-06-20 20:17:38.343,jpost,"A group of family members of hostages and parents of soldiers and reservists petitioned the High Court of Justice on Thursday to demand that the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office check whether Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s wartime decisions were affected by his ongoing criminal trial.The petitioners , represented by Adv . Dafna Holtz Lechner wrote that they had sent a letter on May 8 in which they inquired about whether the prime minister&rsquo;s conflict of interest agreement , which he signed in 2020 , applied to his decision-making regarding the war . The petitioners said that they had not received an answer and demanded that the High Court direct the attorney to answer immediately.The May 8 letter to the attorney-general was based on a High Court ruling days before . The ruling turned down a petition similar to the current one but noted that if the Attorney-General , Gali Baharav-Miara , believed that there was a conflict of interest between the prime minister running the war and his criminal trial , she would need to update the agreement accordingly.Hostage families claim against NetanyahuThe petitioners argued , for example , that Netanyahu had requested several delays in his criminal trial due to his being busy running the war . This showed that the prime minister had an incentive to prolong the war as a means to delay his trial.Further , the petitioners said in a statement that they had also argued that they were the citizens most affected by decisions regarding the war and that decisions by the prime minister could impact them immensely regarding either the length and scope of reserve duty , the danger to soldiers , the well being of the hostages or all the above.Holtz Lechner said in the statement , & ldquo;We have heard politicians and security officials saying every day that in issues that are fateful for the State of Israel and its citizens , Netanyahu has acted based on personal considerations and not on the national interest . If this is indeed the case , the attorney-general must act with utmost urgency to respond to the request by those who paid and continue to pay the price of the failure [ on October 7 ] and the ongoing war . & rdquo ; & nbsp ;",hostage families petition to investigate if pm's criminal trials affected war decisions

2024-04-13 13:43:13.567,jpost,"The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed the petition filed by human rights organizations on behalf of the parents of Iyad al-Halak , who was killed by an Israeli police officer four years ago in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Old CityThe petition was against the decision of the Police Investigation Department and the State Attorney&rsquo;s Office not to appeal the Jerusalem District Court&rsquo;s ruling that acquitted the Border Police officer who killed Halak in May 2020.According to the investigation , Halak , 32 , was walking to the special needs school where he both worked and studied . He noticed two police officers shouting and running toward him and immediately ran off.Police gave chase and fired two shots in Halak&rsquo;s direction . He kept running and eventually went into a nearby shed , where another officer opened fire and wounded him . A third officer reportedly shot Halak while he was lying on the ground , killing him instantly.Following a police investigation in October 2020 , the officer who shot Halak dead was charged with manslaughter , which Adalah , an Arab minority rights group , says almost never occurs . However , the officer was acquitted on all charges in July 2023.The officer&rsquo;s claim of & ldquo;perceived self-defense&rdquo ; was accepted by the court as legitimate . Following the ruling , Adalah and the Meezan Organization for Human Rights ( Nazareth ) filed a petition on behalf of Halak&rsquo;s parents , claiming that the decision was extremely unreasonable and warranted Supreme Court review . & nbsp;Setting a new precedentThe petition argued that the court&rsquo;s ruling set new legal norms , and failing to challenge them would have significant legal consequences.According to the petition , the decision effectively lowers the threshold for the justifiable use of lethal force by police officers , which could virtually eliminate all criminal accountability in cases where Palestinians are killed by law enforcement.In addition , the petition argued that the judgment unreasonably expands the parameters of self-defense in criminal law , relying solely on the officer&rsquo;s subjective perception of danger.The Supreme Court reviewed the arguments and rejected the need for an appeal . Justices David Mintz , Khaled Kabub , and Ruth Ronnen handed down the judgment unanimously.Most cases in the Supreme Court are overseen by three of the 15 sitting justices , with only major cases receiving the full attention of the court.The Supreme Court said that there was no basis for judicial interference and that it would only do so in highly exceptional and exceedingly rare cases.The court rejected arguments that the Police or the State Attorney&rsquo;s Office had been influenced by outside factors . The court also dismissed the petition&rsquo;s assertion that it would set a legal precedent .",supreme court upholds decision not to appeal acquittal of officer who killed iyad al-hallak

2023-10-21 18:02:00.570,jpost,"Ever since the shocking , deadly attack by the Hamas terrorist group on southern Israel on October 7 , civilians across the religious and political spectrum have been volunteering to help the war effort , eager to do whatever they can to support IDF soldiers preparing to fight the brutal enemy . & nbsp;Last week saw the largest call-up of military reserves in Israel&rsquo;s history & ndash ; close to 400,000 & ndash ; in response to the brutal massacre of 1,300 Israelis , not to mention the wounded and the roughly 200 hostages taken to Gaza , including babies and Holocaust survivors.Israelis in the center of the country are concerned about their fellow citizens fleeing not only the South but also the North , where they were advised to evacuate in anticipation of a war with Hezbollah . & nbsp;So much help is needed for so many causes , such as hot meals and warm clothing for the soldiers , housing for displaced persons , help for working mothers of small children who remain home from school , and more . And ordinary citizens have risen to the occasion , searching for any way they could contribute to the war effort.The Kovacs familyAmong them is Chava Kovacs , a mother of seven children ranging in age from six to 14 . Residents of the ultra-Orthodox settlement of Tel Zion in Judea and Samaria , she and her husband have been hosting a family of eight from the southern city of Ashdod since the beginning of the current war ; the eldest child is eight and a half years old ; the youngest is two months.The Kovacs family made aliyah from Calgary in 2006 and speak English among themselves . Chava was born in Poland and raised in the western Canadian city ; her husband , Hillel , grew up in Florida . & ldquo;When we signed up to host a family , there was an option to specify haredi/religious / secular , etc . We checked the & lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter , send anyone&rsquo ; button , & rdquo ; Chava told the Magazine . & ldquo;Our guests are a Sephardi haredi family . They don&rsquo;t speak any English . We can manage in Hebrew but prefer English , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We&rsquo;re different in some ways . They&rsquo;re a kollel family ( meaning the husband studies Torah during the day ) ; my husband works . We&rsquo;re a little more relaxed about what we allow our kids to see on media . We allow wholesome content , even if it&rsquo;s secular . & rdquo;Nevertheless , & ldquo;they are very nice , sweet people , and very appreciative , & rdquo ; Chava continued . & ldquo;They are thankful for the opportunity to get away from all the sirens and for being able to go outside freely rather than being trapped in the house . They don&rsquo;t seem traumatized or shocked . But yes , being constantly awakened by sirens when you have young children is unbearable . & rdquo;THE ADJUSTMENT , she said , has not been too difficult . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Their kids are younger than mine , so there&rsquo;s more crying than before ; but otherwise , it&rsquo;s great to help someone . And my kids have new friends to play with , which is so important , since school has been canceled . My kids really enjoy showing the Ashdod kids around all our parks . My eldest took them to the petting zoo on our yishuv the other day . It gave him something fun to do . & rdquo;Even though Chava and Hillel are immigrants , their children are & ldquo;typical Israeli kids who grew up here . They understand English but are most comfortable speaking Hebrew&rdquo ; & ndash ; which helps in this case . & ldquo;Eliyahu , the father of the Ashdod children , now has the opportunity to learn with his hevruta ( study partner ) by phone . He&rsquo;s around some of the time . Baruch Hashem ( thank God ) , we have a big apartment with five bedrooms , so everyone has a little space , & rdquo ; she explained.How does she manage to feed so many people ? & ldquo;I&rsquo;m just making more food and serving simple meals like pita and falafel or meatballs with mashed potatoes and veggies . Their children are young , but still I definitely feel some pressure making sure we have enough food . Basically , I just put out a bunch of containers on the table , and everyone takes what they want . & ldquo;We have a small Crockpot , so I borrowed a big one from a friend , & rdquo ; she added.Several charitable organizations have publicized their willingness to help families in various central locations that are hosting others from more volatile areas . Chava said she has been getting some help from a hessed ( kindness ) kitchen in their community that helps new mothers , people in hospital , and others during challenging times.The Magazine asked if the Ashdod mother has been helping with the preparations . & ldquo;She helped cut potatoes today , but really , she has a new baby and a few small children , so I&rsquo;m happy to let her relax a bit . She said she&rsquo;s helping me tomorrow with the Shabbat cooking , & rdquo ; Chava replied during the interview last Thursday . & ldquo;She&rsquo;s really sweet and wants to help . & rdquo;AS FOR keeping the children busy , the family received permission from the community center to use the local Gymboree at no cost & ldquo;any time they feel like it . & rdquo ; If closed , they can take the key . & ldquo;I&rsquo;m usually not a person who has house guests , aside from nephews or my friend&rsquo;s sons who are here studying for the year , & rdquo ; Chava said . & ldquo;My house looks & lsquo;lived in , & rsquo ; and our Shabbat meals aren&rsquo;t so fancy . My kids chatter a lot at the table . But this family that we&rsquo;re hosting , because they&rsquo;re used to it , are just so happy to be here . I&rsquo;m not bothered that they see that my sink is always full of dishes . & ldquo;I wish I could be a Henny Machlis , & rdquo ; she said of the late rebbetzen who was famous for her remarkable charitable work and hospitality and would host 200 people every week on Shabbat . & ldquo;But this is finally my chance to get a little closer to her example . & rdquo;Chava hopes that this experience will serve as an example to her children as well . & ldquo;I&rsquo;m hoping that my kids will look back on the war with some happy memories of having guests with cute little children rather than being miserable about the situation , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good distraction to have other people to think about and something tangible to do to help . & rdquo;As for residing in the West Bank , & ldquo;We&rsquo;re fortunate to live here , as much as we&rsquo;re so close to Ramallah . We very rarely have sirens and missiles , & rdquo ; she said , adding that & ldquo;with their bad aim , & rdquo ; the Hamas terrorists would be more likely to hit a surrounding Palestinian village than the Jewish settlement . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I think our Ashdod family is happy , & rdquo ; she concluded . & ldquo;Tel Zion is a nice community . They don&rsquo;t care that our apartment isn&rsquo;t 100 % clean or that it&rsquo;s a little run down .

2024-04-02 11:35:24.080,jpost,"WHAT&rsquo;S IN a name ? Does changing the name change the purpose?Not really . It&rsquo;s merely a pacifying ploy to placate objectors . We could see that this week with the Jerusalem parade , which while still in the planning stages , started out as the Adloyada , which signifies lots of joy and merriment . When objections were raised by families of the hostages and their supporters , the event was not canceled , but the name was changed to United Purim.Although it was a muted affair compared to the annual parade during the intermediate days of Sukkot , it still attracted a large number of spectators and participants.According to municipal estimates , the attendance figure was in the realm of 30,000 . But there were also protesters waving placards with signs that registered displeasure at a festive event being held while no agreement had yet been reached on the return of the hostages.In interviews last week , when the holding of the parade was still a strongly contested issue , Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion said that it was a way to bring happiness to the many evacuee children who were being hosted in Jerusalem . On the actual day of the parade , he said that it was not a celebration but a continuation of tradition , adding that Israel&rsquo;s enemies & ldquo;will not stop us . & rdquo;While the frustration of the hostages&rsquo ; families is understandable , they should remember that in Jewish tradition , the Sabbath and Jewish holy days take precedence over grief and mourning , and the week-long shiva mourning period is suspended.As a rabbinically declared holy day , Purim may have less sanctity or strictures than Passover , Rosh Hashanah , Yom Kippur , or Simchat Torah , but it is the only festival where the Jewish people are commanded to enjoy themselves , eat a sumptuous meal & ndash ; and indulge in alcoholic beverages until they lose the ability to discern what is happening around them ( Ad lo yada ) . Moshe Lion a guest of honor ■ TWO DAYS prior to the parade , Lion and his wife , Stavit , were guests of honor at the Hazvi Yisrael Synagogue in Talbiyeh . Although Lion did not lead the service or read from the Torah as he has done during past visits , he did give a mini sermon . It was one of the rare occasions in which congregants heard two sermons instead of one.Referencing the Torah portion that begins with the word & ldquo;zachor&rdquo ; ( remember ) , Lion spoke briefly on the importance of remembrance , then launched into his favorite subject : the revolution that has overtaken Jerusalem , and the huge construction boom throughout the city.Indeed , tall towers are now looming in almost every neighborhood , but the mayor should be aware that the foundations of all these towers are well below ground , and in digging them real estate developers are causing damage to the surrounding area . Walking to the synagogue from his home in Rehavia , Lion must have surely noticed all the potholes and cracks in the road and the pavement , which are a blight on Israel&rsquo;s capital . That situation will only get worse as more cars , motorbikes , scooters , and bicycles traverse the streets.Lack of adequate parking facilities causes increasing numbers of vehicles to park on the pavement , forcing pedestrians to step out into the road . Moreover , electric scooters and two-wheeled vehicles , in addition to parking on the pavement , are also riding there & ndash ; sometimes at extraordinary speeds & ndash ; causing frightening hazards to pedestrians . Is there no one on the city council who cares?Israel Prize news ■ OVER THE years , there has been no shortage of faculty members of the Hebrew University among Israel Prize laureates , but this year there were special circumstances in the choice of Cochav Elkayam-Levy , a legal expert from HU&rsquo;s Davis Institute for International Relations , being named among the recipients . She is being recognized for her tireless work to raise awareness about and acknowledgment of the crimes against humanity committed by Hamas on and following Oct . 7 against Israeli women , children , men , and families.Elkayam-Levy established the Civil Commission on Oct . 7 Crimes by Hamas against Women and Children , which aims at giving voice to the victims and their families , raise awareness about the concerning developments in war crimes against women , children , men , and families on and after the massacre , and raise support for this cause . Her award is in the field of Solidarity ( Ahdut Hadadit ) , which is a new Israel Prize category.Any prize for an HU faculty member is , by extension , a prize for the university itself . HU President Prof . Asher Cohen said : & ldquo;The Hebrew University takes immense pride in the profound impact Dr . Cochav Elkayam-Levy has had on raising awareness and acknowledgment of the atrocities committed against Israeli women , children , men , and families on and following Oct . 7 . Her relentless dedication has served as a powerful catalyst for justice and remembrance , inspiring us all to confront adversity with courage and compassion . & ldquo;We congratulate [ her ] on being awarded the Israel Prize , the state&rsquo;s highest honor , in a testament to her unwavering commitment to shedding light on one of the darkest chapters of our shared humanity . & rdquo;Education Minister Yoav Kisch , in praising Elkayam-Levy&rsquo;s work in the international arena , said that her commitment to exposing the atrocities of Hamas & ldquo;is a crucial pillar in our ongoing struggle for justice and in our efforts to confront the perpetrators . & rdquo ; He said that her work is deeply valued by the people of Israel , who owe her their heartfelt gratitude.greerfc@gmail.com",grapevine : on parade
2021-12-07 19:59:47.300,jpost,"Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip have threatened to implement a gradual escalation against Israel if their demands are not met concerning reconstruction and the blockade on the Strip , complaining that Egypt is deliberately delaying the reconstruction process , according to Arabic media . Sources from the factions told the Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Mayadeen on Monday that the Egyptians did not respond to a position paper presented by Hamas recently , claiming that Egypt is deliberately delaying the reconstruction process in the coastal enclave . The sources warned that Hamas and the other factions in Gaza have set a deadline for the end of this year and would begin a gradual escalation starting next week . The sources added that Egypt refused the entry of a large Hamas delegation which was scheduled to visit Cairo at the end of November . A "" leading source "" in Hamas told Al-Jazeera on Monday that the movement is studying options for an escalation with Israel , also expressing "" strong dissatisfaction "" with Egypt's behavior , saying that it has been reluctant in implementing its promises to Gaza . The source , pointing to what they called Israeli attacks on al-Aqsa Mosque and the tightening of measures against Palestinian prisoners , warned that this would "" explode the situation . "" The Hamas source also claimed that Egypt has been preventing thousands of people from leaving the Gaza Strip without reason . "" Egypt's behavior is considered an abandonment of its commitment to compel Israel in return for the resistance's commitment to the truce , "" the source told Al-Jazeera . On Tuesday , Hamas member Suhail al-Hindi told the Palestinian al-Ayyam news that the factions could no longer accept the tightening of the blockade on Gaza and the prevention of reconstruction , warning that they would not remain silent for long . Unlike the Al-Jazeera and Al-Mayadeen reports , al-Hindi told al-Ayyam that Egypt had made great efforts as a mediator to resolve the various issues . The Hamas official stressed that the factions would "" have their say "" in the coming days . Additionally on Tuesday , Palestinian media reported that the factions in Gaza had warned against Israel's procrastination in lifting the siege on Gaza , calling on mediators to assume their responsibilities "" before it is too late . "" The reports indicated that the "" gradual escalation "" would likely begin with measures referred to as "" popular resistance , "" usually referring to incendiary and explosive balloons , as well as riots and demonstrations along the Gaza border . The situation between Gaza and Israel has remained relatively calm since Operation Guardian of the Walls in May , except for a spike in clashes which took place in August . Despite the claims that Egypt is holding up reconstruction efforts , it signed agreements with Qatar to supply fuel and basic building materials to the Gaza Strip in November . The expressions of disappointment with Egypt come two weeks after Palestinian Islamic Jihad Secretary-General Ziyad al-Nakhlah attacked Hamas for accepting and facilitating economic aid approved by Israel , saying the aid provided by Egypt to Gaza was an attempt by Israel to "" tame Gaza "" with economic incentives . "" The resistance should not play the role of an agent in facilitating the work of citizens within the Israeli entity , "" stressed the PIJ leader in an interview with Al-Mayadeen . "" Israel wants to turn the West Bank and Gaza into warehouses for workers , and this is something we do not accept . "" Israel considers Gaza a time bomb that it wants to dismantle , and the new facilities come within this framework , "" he said . "" Everyone in the region is betting that the resistance will become afraid for privileges and facilities and will not enter into a war . "" Delegations from both Hamas and the PIJ held talks with Egypt's Intelligence Minister Maj . - Gen . Abbas Kamel in Cairo in October , discussing efforts to reach an extended ceasefire and prisoner swap . Mixed reports from the past few months have claimed both that significant progress was made on these two issues and that little to no progress had been made .","gaza factions threaten escalation , lash out at egypt over reconstruction delays"

Aviv Kohavi , Israel Police Chief Kobi Shabtai , Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) Director Ronen Bar and other security establishment officials.Despite every effort by Israel to enable freedom of worship to Palestinians during the month of Ramadan , security forces will continue to act against rioters who try to disrupt public order , Bennett said.Clashes broke out on the Temple Mount between Israeli security forces and Arab worshipers on Sunday morning as Jewish visitors entered the site on the first intermediate day of Passover and hundreds of Arab youths began gathering stones and blocking pathways.Rocket sirens sounded in Nahal Oz on Sunday afternoon , with local residents reporting hearing an explosion . Despite the reports from locals , the IDF announced that the sirens were a false alarm.Early on Sunday morning , Palestinian media reported that Israeli police had set up checkpoints at the entrances to the Old City of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount , only allowing worshipers through after checking their ID cards.Shortly before Jewish visitors began entering the site on Sunday , Israel Police entered the complex , pushing Arab visitors toward the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque . Video shared by Al-Qastal , a Palestinian news site focusing on Jerusalem , showed security forces closing gates and closing the doors of the Dome of the Rock and prayer halls at the site after pushing worshipers inside.Israel Police issued a statement saying they entered the site after hundreds of Arab youths began gathering stones and blocking pathways in an attempt to disturb the peace . & ldquo;Hundreds of law-breaking young people disturbed the peace in the Temple Mount area and inside the mosque during violent riots , which have nothing to do with the sanctity of the holiday and the holy places . These violent outlaws are the ones who defile and desecrate the holy places and try to harm innocent civilians and security forces , & rdquo ; the statement said . & ldquo;Unfortunately , on social media false information and misinformation is disseminated in relation to events , while throwing sand in the eyes of the public in an attempt to incite and agitate , & rdquo ; it added . & ldquo;These false publications , some of which have no grip on reality , try to create improper legitimacy for throwing stones and firing fireworks inside a house of prayer and at policemen and civilians and misrepresenting the holy places and especially the Temple Mount . & rdquo;There were 19 Arabs injured in the clashes , with five transferred to hospitals , according to the Jerusalem Red Crescent.تغطية صحفية : "" نداءات استغاثة عبر سماعات المسجد الأقصى إثر استمرار اعتداءات قوات الاحتـــلال على المصلين ومحاصرتهم "" pic.twitter.com/Ux7ft8z9ne&mdash ; AlQastal القسطل ( @ AlQastalps ) April 17 , 2022Video shared from the scene showed Arabs calling on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to support them , alongside chants in support of Hamas saying , & ldquo;With our souls and blood , we will redeem you , Oh , Aqsa . & rdquo;Jewish worshipers walking in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Old City were attacked by Arab assailants on Sunday morning . Video showed the assailants hitting at least one Jewish victim on the head . Although the worshipers did not require medical treatment , two suspects were arrested in connection with the incident.A total of 728 Jews visited the Temple Mount on Sunday morning , according to the Temple Mount Administration . The compound will be open to Jewish visitors from 7 a.m . to 10:30 a.m . throughout the intermediate days of Passover , including Thursday.Jewish visitors are not allowed to bring religious items with them or to pray on the Temple Mount , according to police regulations , although quiet , subtle prayer without bowing has seemingly been permitted by police in recent years.Amid the unrest on the Temple Mount , Palestinian rioters threw stones at a number of public buses near the Old City , damaging windows and lightly injuring a number of commuters.Nine suspects were arrested during the unrest on the mount and in the Old City , four of whom were involved in throwing stones at buses.Al-Aqsa tensions shake coalitionMeanwhile , the Islamic Movement&rsquo;s Shura Council decided on Sunday evening that Ra&rsquo;am would suspend its membership in the Knesset and coalition in protest against the situation at al-Aqsa . The party called on the Joint List to do the same until a solution is reached about al-Aqsa , adding that it was ready to take a decision for the collective resignation of the Arab parties from the Knesset.Ra&rsquo;am MK Waleed Taha had told Channel 13 on Sunday afternoon , & ldquo;I would expect the government to behave differently toward the Jews who came up to provoke at al-Aqsa Mosque , but it allowed several hundred fascists to do so . The price will probably be the dissolution of the coalition . & rdquo;The decision and warning from Taha came after MK Mazen Ghanaim warned Bennett in a letter on Friday that he would pull out of the coalition if police activity on the Temple Mount did not cease.The office of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called on Palestinians to arrive at al-Aqsa Mosque in order to & ldquo;defend it . & rdquo ; He warned that the actions of Israeli security forces were a & ldquo;dangerous escalation , the repercussions of which are to be borne by the Israeli government alone . & rdquo;JORDAN&rsquo;S KING Abdullah II stressed on Sunday afternoon the need for Israel to respect the & ldquo;historical and legal status-quo at al-Aqsa Mosque/al-Haram al-Sharif and cease all illegal and provocative measures that violate it and could push toward further escalation . & rdquo;The Jordanian monarch directed his government to continue regional and international efforts and communications to & ldquo;stop Israeli escalations . & rdquo;Amid the tensions , Otzma Yehudit head Itamar Ben-Gvir warned on Sunday that he had sent a message to the commander of the Jerusalem Police District saying that if police were not given a free hand to act against rioters , he would establish a bureau at the Damascus Gate . Last year and earlier this year , Ben-Gvir established a bureau in the Sheikh Jarrah/Shimon Hatzadik neighborhood of east Jerusalem amid tensions there.Rabbi of the Western Wall and Holy Sites Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz condemned the violence on Sunday , saying , & ldquo ; [ I ] strongly condemn the severe attack and calamity this morning against innocent Jews on their way to the morning prayer of the intermediary days at the Western Wall . This is an act of terrorism on the path of peace in a city that sanctifies freedom of religion , and anyone who desires should be allowed to pray in peace and security . & rdquo;On Saturday night , Arabs put up a banner on the Temple Mount/Haram al-Sharif reading & ldquo;Hamas calls on you for a general mobilization and to push out the herd of settlers who are threatening to storm al-Aqsa . & rdquo ; Israeli forces entered the complex later in the night to remove the banner and arrested a person there.Clashes broke out between Arabs and Israeli security forces in front of the Jerusalem Magistrate&rsquo;s Court on Saturday night as well , after Palestinian media reported that Israeli authorities had decided not to release some of those detained during the riots at al-Aqsa on Friday . Joint List MK Ahmed Tibi was present at the scene.Early on Sunday morning , video was shared on Palestinian media showing groups of detainees in multiple locations being released , although at least some remained in custody , according to the reports.Hamas official Khaled Mashal stated on Saturday night that the movement had told the Qatari foreign minister it was demanding that sacrifices not be brought by Jews at the site , that Israeli forces not & ldquo;storm&rdquo ; Jenin and that those arrested at al-Aqsa on Friday be released.Mashal added that the foreign minister had told Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh that Israel was not interested in an escalation , and that Hamas had responded that it was also not interested in a step-up in violence but that it & ldquo;had its responsibilities and the escalation in Jerusalem must be stopped . & rdquo;Arabs clash with Israeli forces in Nazareth and the West BankIn Nazareth , Arab-Israelis clashed with police during a demonstration about Friday&rsquo;s clashes at al-Aqsa .

"" We demand an end to all decisions and policies taken in order to restrict us and the conditions of our lives , as well as the return of all that was robbed of our rights during the past period . "" The committee referenced disagreements between Ben-Gvir and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the decision concerning visits to prisoners , stating "" this is neither an acknowledgment by them of this right nor an acknowledgment of this achievement , but rather a dispute over the timing and mechanism for taking it . "" "" This aggression requires us , the prisoners , and our people , to stand up to it and prepare for this real confrontation with an enemy lurking around us .

2021-05-25 11:51:01.727,jpost,"A month before the Gaza war , things were going well for Israel . The Abraham Accords were going strong and a vaccination campaign had made Israel an envy during the pandemic . The peace agreements appeared to herald a new era in the Middle East and all that was required was to keep Iran and its proxies from trying to destabilize the region . A new US administration was keen to increase the US role around the world and support human rights . That might mean no more chaotic policies , like the flip-flops of the Syria withdrawal in 2018-2019 . & nbsp ; On May 22 , after the recent Gaza war , the Palestinian Authority mufti was expelled from al-Aqsa for not supporting Hamas . Hamas was riding a wave of popular support , claiming it had defeated Israel . Protests in many countries had targeted Jews and articles slamming Israel were being printed in newspapers worldwide . China had led efforts at the UN critiquing Israel and in the US , several far-left members of the Democratic Party were calling Israel & ldquo;apartheid&rdquo ; and pushing to stop arms sales . Israel support was declining among key supporters , such as American Evangelicals . Hamas was more popular than ever suddenly and it wasn&rsquo;t even being condemned for firing 4,000 rockets at Israeli civilians , of which some 60 fell in Israeli cities and towns . There&rsquo;s talk now of a shift in how countries will approach Hamas and it has received more legitimacy in the weeks since the war than in the decades prior . Hezbollah and Iran were empowered and not deterred . Pakistan&rsquo;s top diplomat was spouting antisemitism on CNN , and Turkey , along with Iran , was leading the charge to sanction and isolate Israel . In the West Bank , Palestinians were celebrating the Hamas victory . Groups like Human Rights Watch and other anti-Israel groups were talking Israel & ldquo;apartheid&rdquo ; and arguing for a one-state solution . Anti-Israel activists sensed the tide had turned : Israel could be eliminated as a & ldquo;settler-colonial state . & rdquo ; Iran agreed . & nbsp ; How did it come to this ? ISRAEL HAD largely kept Hamas isolated and ossified in Gaza since the 2014 war . Cut off from many supplies by Egypt , it had few friends . It had tried to expand that dwindling support abroad in 2019 and 2020 through visits to Turkey , Malaysia , Qatar and Iran . However , Israel&rsquo;s new relationships in the Gulf appeared to show that Israel was now accepted in the region and a new alliance with Greece and Cyprus could promise new energy deals . Turkey , concerned about the incoming presidency of Joe Biden , was talking reconciliation across the region after being empowered by the Trump administration . The US was & ldquo;back , & rdquo ; Biden said . & nbsp ; When the Biden administration came into office it was after an unprecedented era of uncertainty in the US , with COVID and the former US President refusing to concede . The Middle East was not a priority . Israel had close cooperation with US Central Command and good relations with the US regarding its desire to protect its interests . It was able to act against Iranian entrenchment in Syria . There was no big push for peace . There wasn&rsquo;t even a new US ambassador in Jerusalem . But a slow drumbeat was beginning . In preparation for the incoming Biden administration , the human rights group B&rsquo;Tselem released a report on Israel apartheid . By April 27 , Human Rights Watch would follow suit . On April 29 , the Palestinian Authority postponed its elections , fearing a Hamas victory . Israel had held elections on March 31 and continued to be divided . It was the fourth elections in two years . Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did little to form a coalition . A ray of hope was the rise of Ra&rsquo;am and its head Mansour Abbas . He looked willing to join an opposition coalition after breaking from the Joint List . By May 5 , President Reuven Rivlin had tasked Yair Lapid with forming a government after Netanyahu failed once again to create a coalition . MEANWHILE , tensions were growing in Jerusalem . Ramadan had begun and with , it there were clashes with Israeli police at Damascus Gate . After attacks on Orthodox Jews there was a right-wing rally on April 22 and several were wounded . A dispute in east Jerusalem @ @ @ s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood began to get some international and Palestinian attention . Hamas vowed to defend Al-Aqsa . On Quds ( Jerusalem ) Day , May 7 , Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said Israel was a terrorist state . Iran&rsquo;s IRGC head Hossein Salami also slammed the Jewish state and predicted that it could suffer a tactical defeat or be blockaded at sea . Hamas and Hezbollah made similar statements . Hamas warned Israel that it would respond to Jerusalem clashes and on May 10 , to coincide with Israel&rsquo;s Jerusalem Day marches , fired rockets at Jerusalem . Israel , with Lapid and Naftali Bennett seeking to form a coalition to replace Netanyahu , began airstrikes on Gaza . By May 12 , Bennett had ended discussions on a new government . Riots across Israel in Arab and mixed towns created a crisis . Border Police were rushed to Lod . Attacks and lynchings began on both sides from Bat Yam to Umm al-Fahm , Rahat , Jaffa and other places . There had been clashes in Jaffa since April 20 . Now things took a turn for the worse . Israel called up almost 10,000 reservists , and sent Golani and 7th Armored soldiers to the border of Gaza . It rushed support to the West Bank where shooting attacks and clashes grew . The attacks had begun with Palestinian terror cells targeting the Tapuah junction in early May . Another shooting attack took place on May 7 , near a post at Salem in the West Bank . Israel said the shooters were planning a worse attack . & nbsp ; WHEN ISRAEL retaliated on May 10 , Hamas put into action a plan to use thousands of rockets to pound Ashkelon , Ashdod and Tel Aviv , as well as Israeli airports and population centers . It used drones and planned to use unmanned submarines . It sent anti-tank guided missile ( ATGM ) teams to the border to strike at Israeli vehicles . This was a sophisticated , planned operation , in which up to 140 Hamas rockets would be fired at once in massive barrages . Hamas had perfected this over the years with various rocket attacks at sea , practicing for this scenario . It also showed off new long-range rockets with a range of up to 250 km . , targeting Eilat and perhaps Dimona as well . It knew that a Syrian S-200 had been fired that triggered alerts near Dimona on April 22 . & nbsp ; With Iranian support , there were attacks in the North as well . On May 13 , rockets were fired into the sea from Lebanon and protesters laid siege to Israel @ @ @ s border with its northern neighbor on May 18 . It may have come from Iraq . Rockets fired on May 19 even flew near Kiryat Yam , near Haifa . This was a serious incident . It followed the April 27 downing of a Hezbollah drone . & nbsp ; Now Hamas and Fatah activists are battling over Al-Aqsa , as clashes showed on May 23 , and Hamas is saying that its war has harmed the Abraham Accords . & nbsp ; It&rsquo;s not clear whether Hamas knew its plans would work or the degree to which Iran advised Hamas on this strategy . It is also not clear if the benefit to Hamas and Iran was merely a lucky turn of events for them and that timing dictated the need to go to war but the results were far from certain . Clearly , Hamas didn&rsquo;t have much to lose . Israel , on the other hand , has much to lose and it had diminishing returns from its years of sunk costs in Gaza . Iran and Hezbollah wanted to test Israel&rsquo;s defenses . It increasingly appears Israel walked into a trap in Gaza . It was a trap partially of Israel&rsquo;s own making due to not having a new government and having strategic planning concentrated in Netanyahu&rsquo;s office without checks and balances and broader security cabinet discussion . & nbsp ;",did israel walk into a hamas trap in gaza ?

2024-05-14 12:35:03.943,jpost,"In the best of times , the eerie transition from Remembrance Day & ndash ; the sad music , the half-mast flags , the national mourning & ndash ; into the jubilation of Independence Day is jarring . This year , the first since October 7 changed Israel forever , it was unfathomable.No fireworks , no raucous parties in the parks with the country&rsquo;s top talent belting out the hits , and no kids attacking each other with string spray.According to most reports , the streets were generally extremely quiet for Independence Day , as many of the populace preferred to stay close to home and hunker down with their families and friends for more intimate commemorations.Dueling ceremonies touted the country&rsquo;s irrefutable achievements and its citizens&rsquo ; bravery ( the official state-sponsored events ) on the one hand , and on the other hand , spotlighted the hostages held in Gaza by Hamas and the inability to celebrate amid a bloody war that has seen thousands of soldiers killed or wounded ( the alternative grassroots events ) . The different realities Israel encountersLooking on a split screen , one could ask which was the real Israel at 76 ? They both reflect a reality of where the country is at this most precarious moment in its short life . The only conclusion that can be drawn is that they&rsquo;re both accurate and reflect the pain , uncertainty , and sadness that exemplified this year&rsquo;s Remembrance and Independence Days , as well as the pride in the accomplishments of the world&rsquo;s only Jewish state.We&rsquo;re a broken , damaged country , filled with questions about its government and institutions that enabled October 7 to take place or why it did not succeed in the last seven months of the war to defeat Hamas or bring the more than 130 hostages or their remains back home.Yet , taking a step back , it&rsquo;s undeniable that Israel's last 76 years are a huge success story & ndash ; a triumph of human spirit unmatched in recent history.That doesn&rsquo;t help fill the agonizing void and anguish the country felt this week , however . The 24 hours of Remembrance Day , filled with heart-wrenching stories of the oh-so-fresh deaths of so many people who were so full of life and had so much to offer , was too much to bear.But , bear it we do - because there&rsquo;s no alternative . This year&rsquo;s Independence Day , rather than a celebration , was more like a reminder that yes , no matter how bleak things may seem right now , we&rsquo;re still here and what we&rsquo;ve built and cherish is still worth fighting for.Every day in Israel is Remembrance and Independence Day . We can never forget the sacrifices made by so many to establish the country and bring it to the great heights it achieved in its first 76 years . At the same time , we can never take its independence for granted.Rather than the usual over-the-top merriment , the last 24 hours offered a bear hug to people desperately in need of it . We&rsquo;re a long way from starting a healing process & ndash ; one that will take years to complete , if ever.That will only begin once the hostages are freed , Hamas is rendered not to be a formidable threat to Israel&rsquo;s security any longer , our soldiers stop dying in the Gaza battlefield , and the residents of the North feel safe enough to return to their homes . And , of course , all of that is bracketed by the prime minister and the heads of the country&rsquo;s security apparatus resigning for their roles in not preventing October 7.Until that time , Israelis need to ask themselves : Is what unifies us more powerful than what separates us ? If the answer is yes , then there&rsquo;s hope that Israel&rsquo;s 77th Independence Day will be more joyous than the one that just sunk under the exhaustion of war and sorrow . & nbsp ;",looking at a split screen on independence day - comment
2024-05-21 19:37:39.577,jpost,"Western democratic leaders will soon follow Israel in being hauled before the International Criminal Court unless a way is found to prevent the issuance of warrants against the leaders of the Jewish state , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ABC on Tuesday . & ldquo;Every democracy will be pulled into the [ ICC ] dock . We&rsquo;re first , and you&rsquo;re next . People understand that , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said , as he appealed to Western powers to intervene in an attempt to halt such action.He spoke one day after ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan announced that he sought arrest warrants for top Israeli and Hamas leaders , including Netanyahu , and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for crimes against humanity due to IDF actions in the Gaza War . & ldquo;That has to be stopped . And that has to be resisted . And I can assure you , the vast majority of Israelis and all responsible leaders in the world understand that this should be resisted , & rdquo ; he said.The ICC pre-trial chamber has yet to approve Khan&rsquo;s request . If it does , the warrants would be the first issued against leaders of a democratic country.Israel and the United States are not among the 124 countries that are parties to the Rome Statute which governs the ICC . If warrants were issued Netanyahu and Gallant would risk arrest if they traveled to any of those countries,The Norwegian news site Nettavisen reported that the country&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said that if the warrants were issued , his country would arrest Netanyahu and that he believed all the other signatories to the Rome Statute would do the same.Netanyahu told ABC he was not worried about the threat of arrest . & ldquo;I'm not concerned at all about our status . I think that the prosecutor should be concerned about his status because he's really turning the ICC into a pariah institution . & ldquo;People are just not going to take it seriously . They see it as a politicized thing . I hope that the judges don't turn don't confirm what he says because that will make them into a kangaroo court , & rdquo ; he said.Israeli has been particularly outraged over the equity Khan drew between Israel and the terror organization Hamas , particularly in light of the group&rsquo;s October 7th invasion of Israel in which it raped , dismembered , and burned alive its victims.Khan is & ldquo;creating a false symmetry between the democratically elected leaders of Israel and the terrorist chieftains , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said.It&rsquo;s akin to an ICC Chief Prosecutor seeking arrest warrants for both US and Al-Qaeda leaders in the aftermath of the September 11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York in 2001 , Netanyahu said.It is also akin to the issuance of warrants against both former US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and former German Chancellor Adolf Hitler , he added.This is & ldquo;a hit job . It&rsquo;s not serious , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said.Fanning the flames of antisemitismHe accused Khan of & ldquo;pouring gasoline on the fires of anti-Semitism that are spreading around the world because he is attacking the one and only Jewish state & ldquo ; which is fighting an existential war against Hamas.Norway was not the only country to back the court . The French Foreign Ministry said it supported the ICC&rsquo;s & ldquo;independence and the fight against impunity in all situations . & rdquo;As far as Israel is concerned , it will be up to the court's pre-trial chamber to decide whether to issue these warrants , after examining the evidence put forward by the prosecutor , "" the ministry said.Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne , however , told the National Assembly on Tuesday that the "" simultaneous "" warrant requests must not establish an "" equivalency "" between Hamas and Israel . "" On one side you have a terrorist group that congratulated itself on the Oct . 7 attacks . . . and on the other side you have a democracy , Israel , that must respect international law while conducting a war it did not start , "" Sejourne said.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk stood behind Israel , stating , & ldquo;An attempt to show that the prime minister of Israel and the leaders of terrorist organizations are the same , and the involvement of international institutions in this , is unacceptable , "" Tusk told a news conference.The United States has been particularly vocal in its condemnation of the court , with US President Joe Biden calling Khan&rsquo;s pursuit of warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant & ldquo;outrageous . & rdquo;The United States Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew called it & ldquo;shameful&rdquo ; and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it & ldquo;wrongheaded&rdquo ; and warned that it complicated efforts to reach a hostage deal.He said he was happy to work with Congress on an appropriate response.Some U.S . lawmakers called for the United States to impose sanctions on the court . In 2020 , the United States imposed sanctions on an ICC prosecutor.The Kremlin said on Tuesday it was very curious that the United States appeared ready to use sanctions against the ICC . "" In general , the situation is more than curious in terms of the U.S . attitude and willingness to use sanctions methods even against the ICC , "" Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.In March last year , the ICC issued warrants for the arrest of President Vladimir Putin on war crimes charges.Russia says the warrant against Putin is a meaningless attempt by the West to soil Russia's reputation and denies war crimes in Ukraine . Ukraine says Russia committed war crimes . Russia says the West has ignored Ukraine's crimes , a charge denied by Kyiv.Biden said last year that the ICC's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Putin was justified . The United States has shared details of alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine with the ICC.Russia is not a party to the Rome Statute , which established the ICC , so Moscow does not recognize the court's jurisdiction . "" We are not parties to the relevant statute , therefore , we do not recognize the jurisdiction of the court , "" Peskov said.Reuters contributed to this report .","icc will target other democracies next , netanyahu warns"
2024-05-12 04:47:52.437,jpost,"Israel has begun what looks like a limited operation in Rafah , but seven months after October 7 , the parameters have not changed . Half the hostages have not returned , no alternative to Hamas has been allowed to emerge in Gaza , Israel&rsquo;s international standing has collapsed , its relationship with the US is on the rocks , the economy has taken a hit , antisemitism is skyrocketing , and much of country is convinced the government is prolonging the crisis to stay in power . It&rsquo;s clearly not great.Now imagine an alternative universe in which Israel was led by a morally upstanding patriot who cared about the country&rsquo;s reputation and the fate of Jews worldwide . Imagine that the prime minister understood the power of words to do good and of public diplomacy to persuade . And imagine & ndash ; why not ? & ndash ; that this was Benjamin Netanyahu.Whether or not a limited hostage deal is somehow reached in the coming days , such a prime minister could flip the entire narrative dramatically at any moment by holding an English-language news conference aimed at the world and containing honest truths and easy-to-understand messages with zero political scheming.For starters , he&rsquo;d express deep regret over the loss of life in Gaza . & ldquo;I know it has been severe , although I am not inclined to believe Hamas numbers . We did our best with a situation in which Hamas uses the population as a human fortification unlike any that history has seen and seems to seek as much & lsquo;martyrdom&rsquo ; as possible . Hamas is evil incarnate , and I weep for the Palestinians who are saddled with such maniacal rulers . & rdquo ; That part of the message should be beamed to every US college campus.He would make clear that Israel has no desire to occupy Gaza and no intention of compelling the population to flee . & ldquo;We are only there to remove the threat that attacked us on October 7 unprovoked , massacred over 1,200 people , and promised with great arrogance to do it again . & ldquo;I ask every Palestinian : What would you have recommended that we do , at that point ? Wait for them , then , to do it again ? I&rsquo;m genuinely curious . Is that what you would have done ? & rdquo;A departure from cynicism and self-righteousness&nbsp;The prime minister would say these last words without the kind of smirking , self-righteous cynicism we&rsquo;ve come to expect . He would sound like a mensch , making each listener feel personally addressed . That&rsquo;s because the prime minister is no fool and knows that empathy begets empathy and sometimes even sympathy.THE PRIME MINISTER would , at this point , diverge not only from the style but from the content that has characterized Netanyahu hitherto . He would say he is prepared to end the war right now in exchange for all remaining hostages.He would look into the camera and speak slowly words that will be replayed on every television station in the Arab world : & ldquo;Dear Palestinians , dear people of Gaza : The war can end right now . This minute & ndash ; this very second . No more death and destruction . Life and reconstruction instead . It is the decision of Hamas . & rdquo;He would make clear that Israel wants to engage the world , the region , and the Palestinians in a day-after plan . And he would offer the Palestinians a choice & ndash ; after the hostages have all been released.One option would be for Israel to pull out of Gaza and let the chips fall where they may , which probably means Hamas will remain in power despite its military degradation . & ldquo;For us to do this , there is a major precondition . The group must commit itself to never again attack Israel from Gaza & ndash ; not with rockets , not with exploding balloons , and definitely not with an invasion by armed barbarians . This must be declared by the Political Bureau in documents submitted to the Arab League . We understand it is unlikely , but we are giving you this choice . If you take it , then something good will have come of this war . I will sell this to the Israeli people . Let&rsquo;s see you explain yourselves to the people of Gaza . & rdquo;If Hamas is unwilling to do this & ndash ; and it is close to a certainty that it won&rsquo;t & ndash ; then it would have a second option as well . The prime minister would explain that Israel would allow the entire leadership of the organization and anyone who participated in October 7 & ndash ; thousands of bloodthirsty fanatics and fools & ndash ; to leave the Strip in a flotilla guarded by the United States Navy and headed to whatever country agrees to take them . Turkey and Qatar are deserving candidates . Israel would undertake not to attack them there in the future as well.Here , the prime minister would finally address what Israel would like to see happen in the Strip the day after Hamas . He would jettison the self-defeating boycott of the Palestinian Authority , saying that the PA would be invited to return to Gaza , from which it was expelled by Hamas in 2007 . He would add that Israel would be hoping that the PA revises the problematic school curricula in which pupils are not educated for peace and that it would need to accept assistance , from Israel or from an Arab force , on security in the territory.He would add that Israel would , in exchange for acquiescence in these areas , offer extremely significant financial aid to rebuild the Strip and set it on the road to a reasonable degree of prosperity.The prime minister would also mention the elephant in the room & ndash ; the world community&rsquo;s desire to see a two-state solution in which the West Bank issue is also resolved . Repeating words Netanyahu and other Israeli leaders have said in the past , the prime minister would explain that Israel does not want to forever govern the Palestinians because it aims to be a democratic , Jewish-majority country . But he would add that there&rsquo;s a catch . & ldquo;What happened on October 7 makes it impossible for us to remove the military completely from the West Bank because if that territory fell into the same hands that attacked us from Gaza , the damage would be many times greater . & ldquo;For this , you have Hamas to blame . Every person who supports Hamas supports continuing a level of threat against us that does not allow progress . Therefore , addressing the security danger & ndash ; which is a real danger for us , and not paranoia & ndash ; is the key . We will be working on this with all our partners , but we need some time . Let&rsquo;s focus first on a real solution for Gaza . & rdquo;He would conclude with a broader message that will resonate around the world : & ldquo;Palestinian and Arab friends , and also enemies : We want peace , but we will not roll over . The Jewish people are in Israel to stay . Work with us and you will find a supporter and a champion . The past seven months have offered a glimpse of the hell that awaits us if the radicals prevail . Let&rsquo;s instead ensure that this never occurs again . & rdquo;The prime minister will have not committed to anything that Israel should not itself desire & ndash ; but the deck will have been completely reshuffled . Even if Hamas rejects all the options , among serious people in the world there will be clarity at last , and Israel would have international legitimacy to press on . This is good , because there is no great advantage in dwelling alone.I know & ndash ; the prime minister who does this cannot be Netanyahu . It really does appear that basically nothing drives him but a lust for power and the most vulgar of political calculations . That&rsquo;s why Israel needs a new election with urgency . But I would love to be proved wrong.The writer is the former chief editor of The Associated Press in Europe , Africa and the Middle East , the former chairman of the Foreign Press Association in Jerusalem , and the author of two books about Israel .

2021-05-20 20:55:05.033,jpost,"& nbsp;Even with over 3.1 million Twitter followers and a popular weekly television show , British-American late-night television comedian&nbsp;John Oliver does not run the world . Thank God . & nbsp ; Because if he did , or if he even ran a small country , Israel would be facing a humongous challenge on the international stage . & nbsp ; Oliver delivered a vicious 10-minute attack on Israel on his Last Week Tonight show on Sunday that was as brutally unfair as it was void of any context . To sum up his simplistic argument : Israel is hitting Hamas much harder than Hamas is hitting Israel , more Palestinians are dying than Jews , so Israel is wrong , immoral and guilty of war crimes . & nbsp ; That&rsquo;s the equivalent of saying that because an estimated 500,000 German civilians were killed in World War II , as opposed to & ldquo;only&rdquo ; 67,000 British civilians , the Nazis were right in that war , and Britain was wrong . & nbsp ; And Oliver is not alone . Other late-night comedians , such as Trevor Noah , have jumped into the fray with their pearls of geopolitical wisdom , as have various entertainers and celebrities . & nbsp ; What all that does , in a world where social media amplifies these voices well beyond what they deserve , is to create a sense among many Israelis that nobody understands us , that everyone is against us . And while the Olivers and Noahs are opinion influencers who have an oversized impact on a younger demographic that often gets its views of the world from those types of TV shows , the world&rsquo;s governments & ndash ; most importantly that of the US & ndash ; are not internalizing their drivel . At least not yet . & nbsp ; As the second full week of Operation Guardian of the Walls is nearing completion , it would be a mistake to look at Oliver&rsquo;s and Noah&rsquo;s rants , or the tweets of radical progressive US congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar , or listen to the anti-Israel and often antisemitic chants at protests around the globe , and see that as representative of where Israel stands today in the world . & nbsp ; Those rants are bad , those tweets are infuriating , those chants are pernicious , but when it comes to the world&rsquo;s reaction to Israel&rsquo;s campaign against Hamas & ndash ; meaning the reaction of governments to Israel&rsquo;s actions & ndash ; Israel&rsquo;s situation vis-a-vis the governments of the world is better this time than it was during any of the previous rounds of violence with Hamas in Gaza . & nbsp ; US President Joe Biden and many other leaders around the world have given Israel the & ldquo;critical time we needed&rdquo ; to carry out this operation , former National Security Council head Yaakov Amidror said . & nbsp ; Biden , who has come under pressure from within his own party , primarily from the progressive wing , to take a more active role and demand an immediate ceasefire , said on Wednesday during a call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he supported a ceasefire . Twenty-four hours later , in another call with Netanyahu , he said he & ldquo;expected to see a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; This was after nine days of giving unstinting support to Israel for its right to defend itself , and blocking three different UN Security Council statements calling for an immediate halt to the fighting without mentioning Hamas or the rockets from Gaza . & nbsp ; Some have characterized Biden&rsquo;s call that he expects a de-escalation as US pressure , others that it portends an imminent crisis in ties between the two leaders and the two countries . Amidror cautions against hyperbole . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is pressure , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;I think that what the Americans are saying is that they want to see a ceasefire . But that is not pressure . They understand the need for Israel to complete the operation , they understand we are talking about a terrorist organization that crossed all redlines , opened fire on Israeli cities . Therefore the administration gave us time . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I MAKE no pretense of understanding how America works , & rdquo ; said Amidror , a fellow at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security . & ldquo;I look at what they have done , and what they have done up until now is to give us the time we needed . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror said he was not surprised by this , since the leadership in the Democratic Party & ndash ; & ldquo;contrary to the perception here&rdquo ; & ndash ; still maintains & ldquo;checks and balances over the radical progressive element within the party that sometimes contains antisemitic elements . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; What is ironic about Biden&rsquo;s support is that it has disappointed some on the Right , because it disrupts their narrative that Biden is a reincarnation of Barack Obama who will squeeze Israel at the first opportunity , and at the same time has also disappointed some on the Left who would like to see much less support for Israel . & nbsp ; There are also Israeli domestic agendas at work among those who want to characterize Biden&rsquo;s comments as & ldquo;pressure . & rdquo ; Those politically opposed to Netanyahu would like to cast him now in the role as someone on a collision course with Biden and his administration , while the prime minister&rsquo;s supporters are keen on painting a picture of perfect harmony between the two men who have known each other for nearly 40 years . & nbsp ; But there are objective standards against which to judge pressure to withdraw . Here&rsquo;s one : In April 2002 , just nine days into Israel&rsquo;s Operation Protective Shield aimed at crushing the terrorist infrastructure in the West Bank that was responsible for hundreds of deaths during the Second Intifada , president George W . Bush called on prime minister Ariel Sharon to withdraw IDF troops immediately from the Palestinian cities they had moved into . & nbsp ; At a press conference in Crawford , Texas , Bush said , & ldquo;My words to Israel are the same today as they were a couple of days ago : Withdraw without delay . & rdquo ; He added that he expected Israel to & ldquo;heed my advice . & rdquo ; Sharon didn&rsquo;t , the military campaign went on for another month , and US-Israel ties survived . & nbsp ; Biden&rsquo;s expectation of de-escalation and support for a ceasefire does not come near that Bush standard of rhetorical pressure . & nbsp ; AVIV SHIRON , a recently retired diplomat who previously served stints as Israel&rsquo;s ambassador to the Netherlands , Austria and Switzerland , said that in comparison with other rounds of violence in Gaza in the past , & ldquo;the international pressure this time is less significant and massive . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We have seen the new US president give full support to Israel&rsquo;s right to defend itself , and did not demand an immediate ceasefire . Now he is calling for a ceasefire , but we are 11 days into the operation & ndash ; that is very significant . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Also inside the European Union , which is always more critical , there were more countries this time that supported Israel&rsquo;s right to defend itself , and did not demand a ceasefire . & rdquo ; He also pointed out that Israeli flags were flown atop government buildings in Germany , Austria , the Czech Republic and Slovenia as a sign of solidarity . & nbsp ; Shiron attributed this primarily to the fewer civilian casualties in Gaza than in the past . & ldquo;The collateral damage is less , and we are seeing fewer pictures of dead and injured and children , even though there are always civilian casualties . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The number of casualties in Gaza is less because the IDF and the air force have learned lessons from the past , and as a result pressure coming from various governments is less , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; Shiron maintained that anti-Israel protests on the streets of London , Paris , Berlin and Washington always accompany this type of conflict , and that there is little difference in them this time around . As they continue , there will be more pressure on various governments to speak out and take a stand , but & ldquo;all in all things are better than in previous times . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Hamas took advantage of existing tensions in Jerusalem as its pretense for launching attacks , and started the current campaign by firing at Jerusalem & ndash ; an act that succeeded in both playing on and building up passions of Muslims around the world , including among Israeli-Arabs , something Hamas certainly deems a & ldquo;success . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; At the same time , however , Shiron said that firing on Jerusalem hurt Hamas in capitals around the world . & ldquo;When you fire on Jerusalem , as opposed to Sderot , it is perceived differently in the world . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror , who agreed with Shiron that Europe has largely given more support for Israel than in the past and allowed it to carry out its operations according to its own timeline , said there were three main reasons for this degree of understanding among many world governments . & nbsp ; First , he said , was Israeli restraint over incidents from Gaza in the weeks before Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem on May 10 . Second , is that it is clear to the governments around the world who started the conflagration . & nbsp ; & ldquo;And the third thing is that they are shooting at civilian targets , while everyone understands we are shooting at military ones , & rdquo ; Amidror said . & ldquo;Sometimes we err and civilians are killed , but our intent & ndash ; and the direction of our fire & ndash ; is toward military targets , while they are shooting at civilians from among civilians . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror said that even those critical of recent Israeli actions in Jerusalem , such as efforts to evict four families from Sheikh Jarrah and police activities during Ramadan at the Damascus Gate , understand that there are huge gaps between the claims of Israeli errors in this matter and the response . & nbsp ; & ldquo;There is disproportionality between the claims against us , and the reactions . For the sake of argument , let&rsquo;s say that they were right , that our behavior could have been gentler in Jerusalem . Does that justify rockets on Jerusalem and Tel Aviv ? There is tremendous disproportionality . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; But that disproportionality & ldquo;plays into our hands , & rdquo ; Amidror said , as & ldquo;reasonable people understand that a terrorist organization took advantage of the situation to fire on civilians . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; While Amidror maintained that the reaction of much of the world overall has not been overly bad , including Russia , China is an exception . There the overseas channel of state broadcaster CCTV aired a report shot-full with antisemitic tropes . & nbsp ; & ldquo ; . . . . Some people believe that US pro-Israeli policy is traceable to the influence of wealthy Jews in the US and the Jewish lobby on US foreign policy-makers , & rdquo ; said host Zheng Junfeng , asking his audience whether US support for Israel was truly based on shared values . & ldquo;Jews dominate finance and Internet sectors . So do they have the powerful lobbies some say ? Possible . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Amidror took umbrage . & ldquo;There is a big difference between being for a ceasefire and antisemitic claims , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;As someone who very much values the relationship with China , it pains me to see antisemitic claims in China compete with the antisemitic arguments of [ Turkish President Recep Tayyip ] Erdogan . This is beneath China . & rdquo ;","amid gaza conflict , global response to israel not as bad as on tv"
2020-11-22 21:17:40.527,jpost,"Two rockets were fired at Israel from the Gaza Strip , one week apart from each other . While the IDF shrugged off the first , blaming it on bad weather , it&rsquo;s now clear . It was not a mistake . It was a message . Hamas is under pressure , and it&rsquo;s getting worse . The coronavirus pandemic is wreaking havoc in the blockaded enclave , and Hamas & ndash ; which is in no mood for conflict with Israel & ndash ; tends to send messages in the form of incendiary balloons or rockets when it is under pressure and needs aid . Though the group was able to effectively deal with the deadly virus during the first wave , the blockaded coastal enclave is suffering from a harsh second wave of the coronavirus , with more than 5,517 total cases and 65 deaths , the majority since September . The Strip&rsquo;s weak healthcare infrastructure , with fewer than 3,000 beds , is unable to cope with all the sick , and is also seeing a record number of daily new cases & ndash ; on Saturday alone the Health Ministry said there were 891 new cases . Fathi Abu Warda , adviser to the Palestinian health minister in Gaza , was quoted by Wafa news agency as saying on Sunday that there was an & ldquo;unprecedented hike&rdquo ; in the number of cases and that the European Hospital in Khan Yunis in the south of the Gaza Strip has reached its limit in receiving coronavirus cases . Thanks to the international aid Israel has let into the Strip , Hamas has been able to increase its testing capabilities from 200 a day during the first wave to 3,500 a day , and the number of ventilators has risen to 160 . Abu Warda also said two truckloads of & ldquo;urgent medical aid , & rdquo ; including respirators and medication for those with chronic illnesses , will enter the Strip in the coming days . But it&rsquo;s still not enough . In addition to the coronavirus crisis , the economy is still a disaster & ndash ; with the unemployment rate in Gaza close to 50 % , with those who are employed earning close to nothing . The average monthly income has fallen from $ 244 to $ 29 since March . Israel&rsquo;s defense establishment and Southern Command have warned several times that there is a direct link between a worsening economy and rocket fire or incendiary balloons . Hamas is also becoming further isolated , including from the Palestinian Authority , which recently resumed security cooperation with Israel following the victory of US President-elect Joe Biden . Following the resumption of security ties , Palestinian security forces in the West Bank are expected to renew their arrests of Hamas operatives in the territory . The normalization of ties between Israel and Gulf states has also placed a strain on Hamas . And that , the IDF fears , will lead to closer ties with Israel&rsquo;s enemy on its northern border & ndash ; Hezbollah . Already following the deal with the United Arab Emirates , Ismail Haniyeh , who heads Hamas&rsquo;s political bureau , met with Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut . There have been more than a dozen rounds of violent clashes between the IDF and terror groups since 2018 , with thousands of rockets fired toward Israel and thousands of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad targets struck by the Israel Air Force in retaliation . But all of them ended without any tangible solution , leading the IDF to change its concept toward a new approach , called & ldquo;Southern Wind , & rdquo ; which would use higher-quality intelligence and firepower to shorten the length of an operation . A new concept is all fine and dandy , but when push comes to shove and a large-scale military operation takes place , neither side will end up as a winner . You just have to look at the recent history of the military operations in the Gaza Strip where nothing changed , except that both sides experienced more death and destruction . So why did the IDF echo Hamas&rsquo;s lightning excuse when two rockets were fired toward central Israel ? Neither side wants a large-scale military operation , and the IDF believes that Yahya Sinwar , Hamas&rsquo;s leader in the Strip , as well as the head of its military wing , Mohammed Deif , still prefer to follow the status quo and avoid confrontation with the IDF . The rockets fired by Hamas are a message sent by Sinwar , a message that has been received and understood by Israel before . The pressure is rising and something needs to be done before the situation explodes . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ;","it wasn @ @ @ t lightning silly , the rockets were a message by hamas - analysis"
2023-08-01 18:05:08.050,jpost,"The armed wing of Hamas , Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades , published on Tuesday a dog tag it claimed its members snatched from an IDF soldier during the 2014 Operation Protective Edge with Israel.The group did not provide further details about the dog tag , which carried the name of the Givati Brigade . & ldquo;We won&rsquo;t talk much about this tag ; the command of the enemy&rsquo;s army knows well who this tag belongs to , & rdquo ; the group said . & nbsp;The publication of the dog tag came on the ninth anniversary of the abduction of IDF soldier Hadar Goldin during the operation . The al-Qassam Brigades said Goldin was & ldquo;captured&rdquo ; on the 26th day of the war in the southern Gaza Strip . & nbsp;IDF St . - Sgt . Oron Shaul's body was also kidnapped in a separate attack during the 2014 operation . Hamas is also holding Israeli civilians Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed captive in Gaza.The incident in which Goldin was kidnapped , according to the Hamas armed wing , took place at dawn on August 1 , 2014 . & ldquo;The enemy forces , taking advantage of talk about a supposed humanitarian ceasefire , penetrated at night more than two kilometers east of Rafah ( in the southern Gaza Strip ) , where they were ambushed by our fighters , & rdquo ; it added.Hamas releases additional details about the ambush on Goldin and his fellow soldiersA Hamas terrorist who took part in the ambush on the Givati soldiers told the Palestine Now news agency on Tuesday that as the soldiers neared the ambush , Hamas terrorist Walid Masoud jumped from the top of a structure onto the signal officer of the Givati soldiers and killed him in order to cut off contact between the soldiers and their commanders.The al-Qassam Brigades terrorist added that the group of Hamas terrorists had waited in hiding for days before the ambush . The terrorist did not address the kidnapping of Goldin.Hamas also re-published photos it claims show Goldin's Tavor rifle on Tuesday . The photos were first published by the terrorist movement in December.At the time of the release of the photos in December , the leader of the Hamas movement in Gaza , Yahya Sinwar , stated during a ceremony that Hamas has been holding & ldquo;secret negotiations&rdquo ; with Israel concerning the captives its holding in Gaza.The terrorist movement is demanding the release of all prisoners rearrested after being released in the Shalit deal and all female , minor , sick and elderly prisoners , as well any bodies being held by Israel , according to Sinwar . & ldquo;We will give the occupation a limited time to complete this deal , otherwise we will close the file of the four soldiers forever , and we will find another way to liberate our prisoners , God willing , & rdquo ; said Sinwar at the time . Mengistu and al-Sayed are both civilians , but Hamas refers to them as soldiers.Goldin family continues campaign for the return of the captivesLast month , Goldin's family protested against government representatives at a memorial ceremony for Operation Protective Edge , with Goldin's mother , Leah , stating she would immolate herself if that's what it would take to bring her son's body home . "" [ Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu , [ Benny ] Gantz , [ Defense Minister Yoav ] Gallant , [ IDF Chief of Staff ] Herzi [ Halevi ] , what do you want ? Do you want me to immolate myself ?

I have no problem immolating myself , I just need to choose the right time and place . Is that the only way you'll understand ? Is this your language ? It doesn't scare me , "" said Leah Goldin ahead of the ceremony.As Netanyahu left the ceremony , Ayelet Goldin , Hadar's sister , shouted toward him "" Benjamin Netanyahu , look a bereaved sister in the eyes .

In the past , the group took credit for similar attacks.A senior Palestinian Authority official , meanwhile , denied that some of the gunmen who surrendered to the Palestinian security forces have been released . & ldquo;They are still staying with us , & rdquo ; the official told The Jerusalem Post , referring to the gunmen . & ldquo;They&rsquo;re not allowed to leave the [ security ] installations . & rdquo;Among those held by the Palestinian security forces are Mahmoud al-Banna , Mohammed Tabanja , Mohammed Yaish , Emad Ja&rsquo;ara and Bara&rsquo ; Izhiman & ndash ; all senior members of the Lions&rsquo ; Den.One of the founders and funders of the Lions&rsquo ; Den , Mosab Shtayyeh , who was arrested by Palestinian intelligence officers in September , also remains in detention in a Palestinian security facility in Jericho.Wave of violent protestsThe arrest sparked a wave of violent protests in Nablus and one Palestinian was killed during armed clashes between Palestinian policemen and rioters.But the sources told the Post that one Lion&rsquo;s Den member who reportedly surrendered to the Palestinian security forces was seen last week in the Old City of Nablus.They identified the man as Mahmoud Abu Kayed , a former intelligence officer who had reportedly joined the Lions&rsquo ; Den.Other sources claimed Abu Kayed was actually sent by the Palestinian security forces to & ldquo;infiltrate&rdquo ; the armed group and bring about its downfall , and that&rsquo;s why he wasIzhiman , one of the Lions&rsquo ; Den gunmen , was arrested last week by Palestinian security officers while receiving treatment at the Specialized Arab Hospital in Nablus.Izhiman , who is wanted by Israeli security authorities for his involvement in terrorism , was injured last week during an armed clash with IDF troops in Nablus.He was still receiving medical treatment when officers from the Palestinian General Intelligence raided the hospital and took him into custody . He is currently being held in the Jnaid Prison in Nablus.Two other Lions&rsquo ; Den members , Tayseer al-Kharraz and Ikrimah Khamash , who were seriously injured during the IDF raid in which al-Houh was killed , also remain in a local hospital . & ldquo;The Israelis think that killing or arresting some members of the group would put an end to the Lions&rsquo ; Den , & rdquo ; a veteran Palestinian activist in Nablus told the Post.The activist , who said he was a former member of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , the armed group of the ruling Fatah faction , said : & ldquo;They ( Israel ) don&rsquo;t know that the group has become so popular among our people that there will always be many young people ready to join . Look what happened with the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades . How many times have we been told in the past 22 years that the group was finished because Israel killed or arrested most of its leaders ? & nbsp;Today , the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades is very powerful and has a strong presence in the West Bank because the new generation has kept it alive . & rdquo ;",pa denies releasing lions ’ den members as group resumes shooting attacks

2021-05-20 21:05:11.230,jpost,"& nbsp;Delegates to the 16th Socialist International were milling about the Montechoro Hotel&rsquo;s lobby in Albufeira , a sleepy resort town off of Portugal&rsquo;s Algarve coast , when a gunman nailed five bullets into Palestinian cardiologist Isam Sartawi&rsquo;s chest and head . & nbsp ; The assassin vanished under a hail of police bullets . His target , the first PLO leader to advocate recognition of Israel , and also to openly hold talks with Israelis , was soon pronounced dead , along with his message . & nbsp ; Sartawi&rsquo;s Israeli interlocutors came from the thick Left , people like Maj . - Gen . ( res . ) Matti Peled and former Labor Party secretary-general Arieh Eliav , but when shot he was but one wall away from Shimon Peres , who would become prime minister the following year . & nbsp ; Rumors of a planned meeting between the two were probably unfounded , but to the assailants & ndash ; the Abu-Nidal terrorist group & ndash ; that didn&rsquo;t matter ; Sartawi spoke peace , and that made him anathema and his death foretold . & nbsp ; It was part of a pattern , one that neither began nor ended on that sorry day in April 1983 , and in fact laces Israel&rsquo;s history almost from its birth to these very days of awe ; days which make many assume fatalistically that peace-killers will always defeat the peacemakers . Well they haven&rsquo;t , and they won&rsquo;t . & nbsp ; THE FIRST of the peacemakers to fall in the line of duty was Jordan&rsquo;s King Abdullah , who was shot in 1951 at the Mosque of Omar&rsquo;s entrance after holding secret talks with David Ben-Gurion&rsquo;s emissaries . & nbsp ; Two years before Sartawi&rsquo;s murder , Anwar Sadat was mowed down by four Islamist gunmen who emerged from a truck during a military parade and emptied their Kalashnikovs at the presidential podium killing , besides Sadat , another 10 men . The young peace treaty with Israel , though only part of a broader Islamist agenda , was a key element in the squad&rsquo;s motivation . & nbsp ; The following year Lebanese president-elect Bashir Gemayel , who had been dialoguing with Israel for a while and was widely expected to make peace with Menachem Begin , was blown up along with 26 others during a political meeting in Beirut . The assassin , widely believed to have been activated by Syrian agents , cited the alliance with Israel as the cause of his act . & nbsp ; The common denominator among all these assaults is the belief that Arab-Jewish peace , no matter how limited or embryonic , is an abomination that must be nipped in the bud . & nbsp ; Now this history is once again at play ; not in Hamas&rsquo;s quest to fight & ndash ; that&rsquo;s a given that needs no pretext & ndash ; but in its timing . Hamas could have started this round of violence long before or well after this month . What made it press the trigger was Israel&rsquo;s first-ever Arab-Jewish coalition agreement , which was but several days away from being signed . & nbsp ; The extraordinary Bennett-Abbas-Lapid government was set to inspire a great Arab-Jewish reconciliation , a prospect that from the viewpoint of Hamas was intolerable . Like Sartawi&rsquo;s evolving dialogue and like Gemayel&rsquo;s burgeoning peace & ndash ; it had to be preempted . Hence the rush , scope , and total abandonment of measure with which Hamas unleashed its wrath . & nbsp ; Time will tell to what extent the fighting&rsquo;s spillover to Israel&rsquo;s mixed towns was micromanaged by Hamas operatives . However , it is clear already now that the rampages in Lod , Acre and Jaffa served Hamas well , and that whether or not they were conducted from Gaza they were clearly incited from there . & nbsp ; Worse , in terms of its immediate aim the ploy worked . The breathtaking move Naftali Bennett had already introduced with the inspiring statement that & ldquo;a broad government is not a default , it&rsquo;s an aim , & rdquo ; was summarily shelved . & nbsp ; Like that peace with Lebanon&rsquo;s elected president which Israel was already touching and smelling only to see him and his gospel murdered , the great reconciliation that Bennett and Mansour Abbas seemed ready to launch was trampled , overnight , by thugs who lynched pedestrians , shattered storefronts , and torched synagogues . & nbsp ; The question this plunge from utopia to dystopia raises is therefore this : Can peace survive its murder ? & nbsp ; STRATEGIC SURPRISES are good at what they announce & ndash ; surprise & ndash ; but their planners often fail to plan for what their surprises uncork . & nbsp ; Hitler&rsquo;s invasion of the Soviet Union , Japan&rsquo;s attack on Pearl Harbor and Egypt&rsquo;s crossing of the Suez Canal were stunning . All three , however , were ultimately defeated . Hamas&rsquo;s strategic surprise is headed the same way . & nbsp ; The Germans disparaged the Russians&rsquo ; industrial ability , the Japanese underestimated America&rsquo;s fighting spirit , the Egyptians didn&rsquo;t calculate Israeli improvisation , and Hamas doesn&rsquo;t understand what the sight of a torched synagogue does to a Jew , any Jew , even a leftist , an agnostic or a convert . & nbsp ; On this front the counterattack is already underway , with hundreds of arrests that will be followed by harsh indictments that will produce lengthy jail terms . & nbsp ; Equally swift will be the physical restoration that the peace-murderers&rsquo ; carnage demands .

2024-06-18 13:08:57.680,jpost,"The State Comptroller&rsquo;s Office instructed , in a letter sent Tuesday , that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s chief of staff send over transcripts of meetings as part of a review of the cabinet&rsquo;s functioning in the years leading up to the Israel-Hamas war after the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office ( PMO ) refused the comptroller&rsquo;s first request to send them.The PMO said that the High Court&rsquo;s decision to stop the comptroller&rsquo;s review of the IDF and Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) meant they could not send the materials , which include meetings with security officials , according to the comptroller&rsquo;s office.The High Court of Justice on Sunday froze the state comptroller&rsquo;s probe of the IDF&rsquo;s October 7 failures until a hearing on the dispute will be held in July , and possibly for much longer.In addition to the letter , the comptroller sent a request Tuesday to the High Court to hold an urgent hearing about the decision and on the PMO&rsquo;s refusal to send the documents following the decision.The PMO responded to the letter saying , & ldquo;contrary to what has been claimed , we are planning to give all the material to the comptroller . In light of the contradictions between the instructions of the high court to not give materials and the request of the comptroller , we have asked for a legal opinion on the matter . & rdquo ; & nbsp;IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen .

The comptroller also said that turning over these documents will not impact the attention of security officials and so will not cause security concerns.The high court decision & ldquo;does not refer to the PMO , & rdquo ; said the comptroller&rsquo;s letter . & ldquo;The request of documents from the PMO was done within the framework of a review our office is doing of the function of the political echelon before the war , and so there is no reason to connect this request to the aforementioned [ court ] decision . & rdquo ; & ldquo;The fact that the meetings [ in the requested transcripts ] were between the prime minister and IDF and Shin Bet officials , does not mean that these documents are within the purview of the High Court&rsquo;s decision . & rdquo;Its decision & ldquo;was not intended to lead to a cessation of all reviews by the comptroller&rsquo;s office of all bodies who have an affinity to the Swords of Iron War , & rdquo ; said the office , adding that the review of other offices who have a connection to the war is ongoing.The comptroller&rsquo;s letter also said that the PMO has been refusing to provide documents pertaining to the period before October 2021 requested by them for the past few months.Yonah Jeremy Bob contributed to this report .",state comptroller demands pmo documents including on meetings with the idf and shin bet
2021-05-20 01:26:09.217,jpost,"Hamas has been dealt a heavy blow after severely miscalculating the Israeli response to its rocket attacks , analysts believe . Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad have so far lobbed nearly 4,000 rockets from Gaza into Israeli territory in less than two weeks . Israel&rsquo;s Iron Dome missile defense system has successfully managed to intercept the majority of these in midair . & nbsp ; Nevertheless , 12 Israelis have been killed and hundreds more injured . & nbsp ; On the Palestinian side , some 219 people have been killed in the ongoing flare-up , according to Gaza&rsquo;s health ministry . Of those , Israel has said that at least 150 were combatants . & nbsp ; According to Dr . Harel Chorev , an expert on Palestinian affairs and head of the Network Analysis Desk at Tel Aviv University&rsquo;s Moshe Dayan Center , Hamas has suffered significant losses during this round of fighting . & ldquo;Hamas lost in every strategic calculation : Many of their tunnels in the Strip are destroyed and their maritime forces are also paralyzed , & rdquo ; Chorev told The Media Line . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Since the damage is very high , this will be a lesson that Hamas will take into account . Unlike in 2014 [ during ] Operation Protective Edge , they were not ready . & rdquo ; Israel pummelled a network of underground tunnels in the Palestinian enclave that were being used to hide rockets and launchers . IDF spokesperson Brig . Gen . Hadai Zilberman on Wednesday said that Israeli Air Force planes had targeted 15 km ( roughly 9 miles ) of tunnels , dropping 122 bombs on the southern Gaza Strip overnight on Tuesday . & nbsp ; When Hamas initially began launching rockets into Israel last week , they mistakenly believed that the fighting would only last a day or two , Chorev said . & ldquo;It will be very hard for them to recover their underground infrastructure , & rdquo ; he stated . & ldquo;They thought that it would be inconvenient for [ Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin ] Netanyahu to attack now , which is quite the opposite . It was quite good for him , politically . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Hamas&rsquo ; ongoing strategy , he added , relies on a combination of guerrilla tactics and more traditional military weaponry like rockets and mortars . While Israel has been mostly successful at countering the group&rsquo;s rockets and has efficiently targeted fighters in Gaza without needing to send in ground forces , Hamas has also notched a few surprising victories of its own . Namely , in helping to stoke the divisions between Arab and Jewish Israelis across Israel . The rioting and unrest recently seen in several towns and cities , Chorev argued , & ldquo;is the main asset of Hamas and they are totally surprised by it and trying to inflame [ the situation ] more and more . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Islamist group , which runs the Gaza Strip , has also managed to score a few points in other key strategic areas , including undermining the Palestinian Authority , which recently called off general elections in the West Bank . In addition , they succeeded in putting the international spotlight on the Palestinian issue . In terms of firepower , Hamas has also advanced , according to a former Israeli counterterrorism chief . & ldquo;Naturally , when the pace of [ rocket launches ] is greater and the warhead is larger , then the damage is more significant , & rdquo ; Brig . Gen . ( Res ) Nitzan Nuriel , a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya , told The Media Line . & nbsp ; Nuriel , a former director of Israel&rsquo;s Counter-Terrorism Bureau , pointed to Hamas recently devising a system that can launch multiple rockets at a time . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Their missile capabilities & ndash ; from the size to the range and the warhead dimensions & ndash ; in all of these areas Hamas has improved , & rdquo ; Nuriel said . & ldquo;They&rsquo;ve improved thanks to Iranian know-how as well as through experimentation . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Many of the materials the group uses to manufacture their weapons come through the Rafah Border Crossing , located between Egypt and the Gaza Strip . Some of these are standard construction materials , like pipes . & ldquo;The Egyptian system is not as hermetically sealed as our [ blockade ] is , so I am guessing that Hamas is managing to smuggle in materials through the Rafah crossing , & rdquo ; Nuriel said . & ldquo;Ten percent of the pipes entering the Strip are turned into rockets or else the metal is melted down in order to be recast into a relevant shape . & rdquo ; Daniel Sonnenfeld contributed to this report .","hamas dealt heavy blow , ‘ surprised ’ by israeli response , analysts say"

He told the GA that the time had come for Jerusalem to unite rather than divide the three monotheistic religions . & ldquo;I believe Jerusalem&rsquo;s holiness to Muslims , Christians and Jews can and must bring us together , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;With international help , the holy city can be , not a cause of division , but a symbol of unity for all to see . & rdquo ; Jordan , along with the PA , has been concerned that Israel wants to change the status quo understanding with regard to those sites , particularly with respect to the Temple Mount .

2024-04-05 19:41:43.227,jpost,"Chen Peiper , born in the Netherlands , is an esteemed Israeli jewelry designer and teacher , and over the last two decades has been a glass sculptor . As an artist , she is very sensitive to and perceptive of the surrounding realities.In her career , Peiper&rsquo;s works have been on show at numerous solo and group exhibitions in Israel ( in 2023 at the Tel Aviv Bienniale of Crafts and Design at the Eretz Israel Museum ) , The United States , and Europe.She works with different techniques , using materials such as gold , silver , stainless steel , aluminum , and copper . When designing sculptures , she combines glass with metal.Her works reflect her personal experience ( as in her solo show & ldquo;Fish Plus&rdquo ; in 2020 ) and social exposure.In 2022 , Peiper participated in the Venice Art Bienniale , presenting Covitrum & ndash ; 18 glass anonymous faces in various masks worn during the pandemic . There , she also showed the powerful Refugees , dedicating it to the African emigrants . & nbsp;The artist&rsquo;s latest work , New Life , is centered on the motif of Israeli flags , which expresses Peiper&rsquo;s deep concern for the situation in Israel , during last year&rsquo;s protests and the ongoing war.In an interview with the Magazine , Peiper said that she made aliyah during the Yom Kippur War , and she shared her memories from that crucial-for-Israel time . This was in 1973 , when Peiper was nearly 27 years old , and the State of Israel was only 25 . Almost as peers , they grew up together.Before we move on to your current work , as a sea lover I must ask you about your solo exhibition from 2020 about the underwater world , & lsquo;Fish Plus . & rsquo ; Why fish?It&rsquo;s related to my childhood in Holland . My parents used to have a summer house by the sea , and I was always on the water : in a sailboat , a rowboat ; I was very sporty , and the water was very important to me . I was living in it . So I made sculptures of what I remembered.But also one of the sculptures was inspired by a drawing of my grandson , which he made when he was six years old . All the sculptures were in the fusing technique ; I used transparent and hand-painted glass , combined with silver , copper , and iron . & nbsp;A magical experience for the viewers and a nostalgic trip into your past . Speaking of your past , when we first met , in December , you said that you moved to Israel 50 years ago&hellip;Yes , in 1973 , in the middle of the [ Yom Kippur ] War . I made aliyah at the age of 26 , almost 27 . I was already after my jewelry design studies at Rietveld Academy of Art , in Amsterdam . I had been already working . We ( my husband and our one-year-old daughter , Tamar ) were already on our way to Israel when the war started.Were you on the plane?No , my husband said that the plane went too quickly , and he wanted us to have an adventure , so we went on a cruise , on a ship to Israel . We started it from the south of France . Just as we were about to begin our trip , some people told us there was a war in Israel . Then , we wanted to make aliyah even faster.The war didn&rsquo;t stop you from this move?No , when you want to live in a country , a war is not a reason to go away . You stay here ; you don&rsquo;t leave the country because of a war.And why did you want to make aliyah in the first place?My husband is Israeli , born in Tel Aviv . He has lived in Holland for 10 years , and we met at the Academy of Art . We could have stayed in Holland , but it was clear to us that we could not live in both countries , and we decided that we wanted to live in Israel . & nbsp;Following this decision , you arrived in the middle of the Yom Kippur War . . . It happened like that . We moved in with Gidi&rsquo;s , my husband&rsquo;s , parents in Ramat Hasharon , which made things much easier . & nbsp;How was Israel back then ? How do you remember Israel during the Yom Kippur War?Cities without men . Tel Aviv , Hod Hasharon , completely without men . For a few months , it was like that . Life was quieter . There was nobody on the streets . It was a real war for us in the center of Israel . Now during the war people continue their lives , shops are open , and people are sitting at coffee shops ; back then , the streets were empty . But also the streets looked different . Now everything is modern ; in 1973 there were clouds of sand on the roads of Ramat Hasharon.And how different was the society of Israel back then in comparison to today&rsquo;s?It&rsquo;s hard for me to say . I jumped into the group of Gidi&rsquo;s friends . They all were in the army and all talked about the army , so it was difficult . And they were shy to speak in English to me at that time.But in general , you could have visited a friend or a neighbor anytime . Now you must call or text to set up a visit . [ Back then , ] the doors to the apartments were always open . & nbsp;From what you are saying , it sounds like people were closer to each other . As we speak , I&rsquo;ve just realized that you and the State of Israel are almost the same age . Since 1973 , the very young state of 25 years and you , almost 27 years old , as peers you grew up together.I have never thought of this , but this is true , yes . [ She laughs . ] And after the Yom Kippur War , how do you recall Israel?We all worked very hard . We wanted to build something , and we felt we did . & nbsp;Do you mean your life or also Israel?Also Israel . & nbsp;So after the war , you started to work in your profession , as a jewelry designer?Yes , at home . People have come especially to me . I looked at how a person behaved and what he [ or she ] liked , and based on that I was designing . & nbsp;Before shifting to glass sculptures ( which is your main focus right now ) , for 40 years you were creating jewelry , showing it at professional exhibitions in the Netherlands , Israel , and the US , and you were also teaching how to design . & nbsp;Yes , I taught design at a technology center for jewelry in Tel Aviv ( 1985-1995 ) , and in 1993 at a special program for Bedouin girls and young women who were making traditional Bedouin jewelry but wanted to learn about other approaches ; and ( in the years 1990-2000 ) at Beit Berl art college in Ramat Hasharon , where I was head of the jewelry department . & nbsp;So you had an established professional position , and suddenly in 2002 you went to Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design to study glass design . What triggered that?I was looking , for a long time , for something else . I hoped that if I had another material , it would be more interesting for me and more creative.My husband , who has been always very supportive of me , saw in a newspaper that there was an opening of a new department of glass , as a second degree , at Bezalel . I applied and got accepted.It was two years of hard work , but it was very interesting to me to learn various techniques of working with glass . It was wonderful , in the middle of my life to start with a new material ! But I have never forgotten about my metal . The metal always helps me to design the inside of the glass . It adds the feeling . I have combined it with glass.What attracts you to glass?It can be transparent and doesn&rsquo;t have to . You can do everything with it , move it in all the directions you want to . Another thing , jewelry is also art , but when you create in gold it is [ displayed ] in a glass box ; people can&rsquo;t touch it . And I like it when people can touch a sculpture . & nbsp;It changes the experience of the viewers . With your art you reflect on your personal experience , but also on group and social exposure , such as war , the issue of African refugees , or the pandemic . In 2022 , at the Venice Art Bienniale , you showed [ the installation ] Covitrum ( COVID and vitro , & lsquo;glass&rsquo ; in Latin ) , a series of glass sculptures & ndash ; unrecognizable portraits , without distinction in gender or skin color . These faces were covered with different masks worn during the pandemic.Yes , the only distinction was that I made 13 adults and five children ( representing my five grandchildren ) , together 18 . I chose this number because of its gematria ; the number 18 means chai & ndash ; & lsquo;life , & rsquo ; in Hebrew . & nbsp;Why did you want to incorporate a number important in Judaism , in a way taking away from the universality of this project?It was very important to me because it is a very powerful number . Each head was covered with a different mask . In these masks I put the story . A mask is a tool of pretense and protection , and it allows introspection . It gives a space to reveal or hide the identity and feelings . One of them was transparent , and I called it & lsquo;Read my lips . & rsquo ; But there was also the Israeli flag , the Venice flag , and a rainbow LGBTQ flag mask . & nbsp;On view in Italy , there was also your sculpture Refugees , dedicated to people who fled their countries across the sea in inhuman conditions . A huge unresolved issue of African emigrants often losing their lives on the way to Europe was expressed in your powerful sculpture.I wanted to show the colors of the sky and the sea and , in between , human beings . The sea was their last refuge . They were mostly Black people , so I used the colors black and red ( as blood ) . You can see that they are all on the boat , but one is outside & ndash ; didn&rsquo;t make it . & nbsp;You responded to this tragic reality with extreme sensitivity . Your latest sculptures are also very socially engaged . In December 2023 , at a group exhibition & lsquo;The Colors of Camouflage , & rsquo ; at the Periscope Gallery in Tel Aviv , you presented two series of work : & lsquo;Upside Down , & rsquo ; in camouflage military colors , and & lsquo;New Life , & rsquo ; with motifs of Israeli flags in glass , flowing in different shapes . In both cases , you&rsquo;ve connected a very smooth and elegant movement of glass attached to very simple and basic metal food cans . What was the idea behind this concept ? And did you make this series of sculptures before the war or during the current war?I started before the war . During the war , my feelings about it were even stronger . I am very connected to my grandsons , what they do.Do they serve in the army now?Yes , three of them . I am very proud of them . & nbsp;So the colors came from your grandsons?Yes , although not directly . I was worried , in general . The flags , at first , were connected to the last year&rsquo;s demonstrations in Israel . I wanted to show the sadness of thousands of people being with a flag during the protests . I was concerned about what would be with this country and what was going on . I am still , I am worried.What do think will be with Israel ? & nbsp;The future will not be easy . But I think that we are very strong , and we have to be very strong . & nbsp;We are talking after many months of war , and you are wearing a & lsquo;Bring Them Home&rsquo ; necklace [ in solidarity with the hostages ] , and you are still saying that we are very strong?This is a very scary and ugly fairy tale . But , of course , we are very strong ! Otherwise , we & ndash ; you and me & ndash ; would not be here today.So how do you see the future of Israel now , also with the new wave of antisemitism around the world?When I listen to my daughters , Tamar and Dafna , they are worried . When I listen to my grandsons , they are full of life and they believe that everything will be fine . & nbsp;Why did you connect flags with simple cans?They are real cans , reused . By adding a flag to them , there is something new , and maybe there will be something new in the region , not the same as it was before.Whatever happens in Israel , I express it in my art , both my jewelry and glass sculptures . But the first reason why I used the cans was practical & ndash ; the metal [ material ] and its form . Then I realized that I could use different shapes of cans , which gave me new feelings.When I saw these sculptures at the exhibition , looking at the Israeli flags made of glass , I thought that this was Zionist art . Is it okay to call your art Zionist?I am very pleased to hear it!Do you think there is a place for something like Zionist art , that the Israeli artists will want to go in this direction?This is interesting , what you are asking . When I look back at the exhibition ( and this is very important , to look back and check with yourself what you did ) , I ask myself if it was only the obsession of flags . But it wasn&rsquo;t . In every piece , I put my feelings inside . & nbsp;How would you name these feelings?New life . ■ On April 18 at 7 p.m . , at Beit Yad LaBanim cultural center , 2 Hamahteret Street , Ramat Hasharon , a group show will open which will include one of Peiper&rsquo;s new works , View of Israel . & nbsp;The artist&rsquo;s website : chenpeiper2.wixsite.com/chen",the flag in focus : zionist art
2022-04-19 19:29:55.813,jpost,"As tensions escalated along the Gaza border with retaliatory airstrikes in response to a rocket fired on Monday evening , all 13-year-old Libi Kohn of Ein Hashlosha wanted was for there to be calm , so her kibbutz youth group could hold its planned gathering in the evening . & ldquo;I just mostly hope that this won&rsquo;t develop into anything , and we can go on with our activity and I can meet with my friends , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;We asked our counselor whether it would be canceled , and he said he didn&rsquo;t know yet . So we are waiting . I want the Passover vacation to be like it should be where I can enjoy it with friends . & rdquo;The rocket fired from Gaza followed tensions in Jerusalem , as dozens of Palestinian rioters were injured and hundreds arrested following violent clashes with police on the Temple Mount.The sound of sirens has been so much a part of Kohn&rsquo;s life that she didn&rsquo;t know if she could really use the word & ldquo;fear&rdquo ; to describe how she felt when she heard the red alert phone application beep , when a rocket was launched at her kibbutz just as she was sitting down to dinner with her family at her grandparents&rsquo ; home at around 8:30 p.m . & ldquo;We heard the red alert for Kissufim , and at first didn&rsquo;t understand what was happening , & rdquo ; said Kohn . & ldquo;Then we heard a loud boom and ran to the bomb shelter in the house . & rdquo ; The whole family had gathered for dinner , 16 people altogether . & ldquo;We let my grandmother go in first so she could sit down , and then we the grandchildren went in . & rdquo;The rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome missile-defense system . There were no reports of injuries.After the all-clear , they returned to the dinner table . At night they closed the metal window on the bomb shelter , which is also Libi&rsquo;s bedroom , and made sure there was a clear path to the room in case the family needed to reach it in the middle of the night . & ldquo;I want the government to create a situation where we don&rsquo;t have to pay for the situation every Passover , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;We want the government to make us feel safe so we don&rsquo;t have to pack a suitcase all the time and run . I don&rsquo;t know how they should do that , but the nation voted for them and it is time that they do that . & rdquo;There are no magical solutions to the situation , said Libi&rsquo;s mother , Meirav , 49 , who was born in Ein Hashlosha . & ldquo;You never know when or where it will come , but we understand that with everything that is happening in Jerusalem , we will end up paying the price , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;When the security situation heats up , it will end up reaching Gaza . & rdquo;FOR THE most part , the Kohns enjoy a quality of life that makes up for the occasional missiles they have to contend with . & ldquo;I am sure this is where I want my kids to grow up , even if sometimes we have these&rdquo ; attacks , said Meirav.But the government should reach a comprehensive solution once and for all , she said , even if that means an initial military operation to get both sides to the negotiating table.Almost 4,400 rockets were fired at Israel from Gaza in May&rsquo;s 11-day war , Operation Guardians of the Wall , in which 256 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed . In 2014 , Operation Protective Edge lasted six weeks and some 2,100 Palestinians were killed , including 1,462 civilians . Sixty-six Israeli soldiers and seven Israeli citizens were also killed . Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 left 167 Palestinians , including 87 civilians , and two Israeli soldiers and four civilians dead , according to B&rsquo;Tselem . & ldquo;It is obviously a very challenging situation for all the governments , also for the last government , & rdquo ; Meirav said . & ldquo;Before we reach a solution we need a serious military operation , but at the same time , if we keep doing the same thing all the time , nothing will change . I do expect the government to be ready after the next war for the day after , and to come with clear goals and to sit and talk and come to an agreement for the last time & ndash ; not to just come , reach a ceasefire agreement , and then go home . & rdquo;Sirens were also activated on Sunday afternoon in Nahal Oz . The IDF later said they were false alarms.However , 67-year-old Adele Raemer , who has lived on Kibbutz Nirim since 1975 , said Israeli residents living along the Gaza border know there is no such thing as a false alarm . & ldquo;A false alarm means something was shot at us from Gaza and didn&rsquo;t reach the border , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;So two days ago after the & lsquo;false alarm , & rsquo ; we knew something could happen . We have been getting rockets since 2006 . This is not something anybody gets used to but is something you learn to live with . Everyone is aware and ready . We know how to sense an escalation . & rdquo;With Ramadan coinciding with Passover , and with Israeli Independence Day and Yom Hazikaron coming up , it can become a & ldquo;prime time for terror , & rdquo ; she said.However , Raemer noted , most Gaza residents do not want an escalation now with an increase of work permits being issued by Israel and Egypt , sending experts to help them rebuild the infrastructure destroyed in last year&rsquo;s war . & ldquo;That is something they don&rsquo;t want to lose , & rdquo ; she said.And while Islamic Jihad has been held responsible for the latest rocket attack , it is Hamas that controls Gaza and needs to be accountable . & ldquo;We are the strong ones here , and I would really prefer that we don&rsquo;t do things that can be seen as inflammatory , & rdquo ; Raemer said . & ldquo;I understand we want to say this is our land , and people have the right of freedom of expression , but we have to take responsibility for our actions . & rdquo;Raemer mentioned the planned flag march by the Im Tirzu NGO . & ldquo;Going out on a march just to beat our chests can have an effect on the rest of our country , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;I hope people will keep their heads on straight and not do something that will be inflammatory . & rdquo ;","for israelis living by gaza , life amid tensions is 99 % heaven , 1 % hell"
2024-04-29 02:47:55.617,jpost,"In a statement on Monday , Jerusalem Chief Rabbi Shlomo Moshe Amar called on the public not to publicly celebrate Mimouna due to the war.Mimouna is a holiday celebrated the day after the end of the Passover holiday and originates with North African Jews ; this year , it will be celebrated on April 30.The holiday quickly spread to other groups in Israel and is now celebrated across different heritage groups.Celebrations often take the shape of open house parties with a wide variety of food ; guests are expected to go from house to house , celebrating with each household , although this is less common in modern times.Politicians quickly picked up on this and began attending and publicizing their attendance at Mimouna parties.Rabbi Amar previously served as the Israeli Sephardi Chief Rabbi from 2003 to 2013 , and shortly after finishing his term , became Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem in 2014 . "" Since we are already past the holiday , it is not appropriate for us to celebrate in public with drums and dancing when so many of our brothers are hostages and wounded , "" he said in the message . "" We will dedicate this night to strengthening ourselves by studying books of faith and security . We will thank the Holy One , blessed be He , for all His graces , and ask for a speedy future redemption of the people of Israel .

2020-12-22 17:57:37.993,jpost,"Palestinian officials on Tuesday expressed hope that a new Israeli general election will not disrupt Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas&rsquo;s initiative to convene an international conference for peace in the Middle East early next year . The officials , who were responding to news about the possibility that Israel may be headed toward its fourth election in March 2021 , also expressed hope that the vote would result in an end to the era of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu . In October , Abbas sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres , urging him to hold pressing consultations in coordination with the Middle East Quartet ( US , UN , Russia and European Union ) and the UN Security Council on convening an international conference & ldquo;with full powers and with the participation of all concerned parties . & rdquo ; The Palestinians believe the prospects of holding the proposed conference have grown after the victory of US President-elect Joe Biden in the US presidential election . & ldquo;The purpose of the international conference is to revive the two-state solution after Netanyahu and [ outgoing US President Donald ] Trump did everything to destroy that option , & rdquo ; a Palestinian official told The Jerusalem Post . & ldquo;We are confident that once Trump is out of the White House , we will go back to the two-state solution . We also hope that Israeli voters , when they go to cast their ballots , would understand that Netanyahu and his government are harming Israeli interests by rejecting the two-state solution . & rdquo ; However , the official said the Palestinians were concerned that new elections in Israel would delay or divert attention from Abbas&rsquo;s plan to hold an international peace conference . & ldquo;If Netanyahu wins again , we expect the Biden administration and the international conference to take real and serious measures to compel Israel to adhere to international resolutions pertaining to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , especially Security Council Resolution 2334 , which calls for an end to Israeli settlement activities , & rdquo ; the official said . While the Palestinians do not meddle in the internal affairs of Israel , another Palestinian official told the Post , they nevertheless would & ldquo;like to see Israelis vote for candidates who believe in a genuine peace process with the Palestinian people . & rdquo ; The past four years of the Trump administration & ldquo;have been very bad for the Palestinians and the peace process , & rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo;We hope Israeli voters would be as clever as the Americans who said no to four more years of the Trump administration . & rdquo ; He , too , expressed concern that new elections in Israel would & ldquo;hinder&rdquo ; Abbas&rsquo;s international conference idea . & ldquo;The elections will undoubtedly delay our efforts to hold the conference , but this will only be a temporary postponement , & rdquo ; the official said . & ldquo;We are optimistic that a Biden administration will endorse the international conference initiative , even if Netanyahu is reelected . & rdquo ; On Tuesday , Abbas won the backing of Russian President Vladimir Putin for the proposed international parley . Moscow supports holding an international peace conference and achieving peace and stability in the region on the basis of UN resolutions and international law , Putin reportedly told Abbas during a phone conversation , according to a statement published by WAFA , the PA&rsquo;s official news agency .",palestinians hope new election will ‘ end netanyahu era ’

2023-05-10 18:48:23.850,jpost,"Egypt continued mediating a ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian Islamic Jihad to end Operation Shield and Arrow on Wednesday , even as the latter continued a barrage of rockets towards Israeli cities in the south and Tel Aviv area . & ldquo;The campaign still isn&rsquo;t over , & rdquo ; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement to the media . & ldquo;We say to the terrorists and those who sent them : We see you everywhere ; you can&rsquo;t hide . & rdquo;However , a senior diplomatic source said that Israel is & ldquo;ready for a ceasefire ; we did what we needed to do&rdquo ; in Gaza . & ldquo;A ceasefire will be judged only by actions and not by words , & rdquo ; another senior diplomatic source said.Following over 100 IDF strikes and over 300 rocket attacks mostly from Palestinian Islamic Jihad of Gaza earlier Wednesday , Egypt reached out to Israel to say PIJ wants a ceasefire , The Jerusalem Post confirmed from multiple sources.Further , top IDF officials have recommended accepting a ceasefire in light of major perceived accomplishments of the current operation & ndash ; though publicly the IDF said it does not comment on such issues.However , as late as 8:00 p.m . , Islamic Jihad and the IDF had each unleashed another significant round of attacks against one another.Foreign Minister Eli Cohen confirmed to KAN News that a ceasefire proposal was sent by Egypt and is under consideration by the defense establishment.The senior diplomatic source said that Egypt is the central player in ceasefire talks , despite reports in Arab media that Qatar and the UN were involved.Rocket barrage launched at southern , central IsraelAccording to unconfirmed Palestinians reports , 21 Palestinians have been killed , with no indications yet from Israel about their identities as combatants or civilians.Netanyahu said that no Israelis died during Operation Shield and Arrow , though there have been reports of a number of injuries.Earlier , around 12:30 p.m . , the IDF initiated a widespread preemptive strike on a variety of Islamic Jihad rocket positions , including some concealed from the public eye , after seeing intelligence signs that the terror group was getting ready for a broad round of rocket attacks on Israel.At 11:45 a.m . , the IDF carried out its first attack of Wednesday on an Islamic Jihad crew that was getting ready to fire rockets near the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis.This incident came after a similar incident on Tuesday early evening.After these incidents and along with other intelligence signs , IDF chief spokesman Brig . Gen . Daniel Hagri said that the IDF decided instead of only selectively attacking rocket crews on their way to their rocket firing positions , to preemptively attack a variety of concealed rocket positions that intelligence had previously found.At that point , Hagari said that the IDF&rsquo;s rationale was that it was better to put the Jihad organization back on its heels again , rather than trying to track dozens of rocket crews once they are already out near their positions.Around 1:00 p.m . on Wednesday , the IDF&rsquo;s analysis of why Islamic Jihad delayed striking back related to shock that the group was going through from a surprise attack overnight between Monday and Tuesday eliminating three of its top leaders and 10 key military positions , followed by the IDF successfully thwarting its initial attempts to strike back , said Hagari.For example , the IDF&rsquo;s attack on an anti-tank missile crew on Tuesday evening thwarted an initial move to use one of its more advanced weapons against Israel , as opposed to many of its rockets , which are less precise.Hagari rejected any conception that Islamic Jihad was successfully using psychological warfare against Israel by rolling out its counter strike slowly.Rather , the IDF&rsquo;s view would be that it has been consistent about keeping Islamic Jihad on its heels , but without getting drawn into a longer fight or a larger fight with Hamas.IDF chief-of-staff Lt . Gen . Herzi Halevi visited the South early Wednesday afternoon to personally ensure that Israel's missile defense and other defense elements remain on the highest levels of alert.If Hamas had joined in in a serious way , the conflict could have been extended longer than the multiple rounds Israel has had with Islamic Jihad which have all ended in less than 72 hours.But Hamas mostly stayed out of the fight , despite some of its public statements that it would join in.The IDF said on Wednesday that the David Sling missile defense system had also been used to shoot down a mid-range rocket fired at Tel Aviv.David's Sling&nbsp;In 2018 , David's Sling was used against two missiles being fired from Syria , but it has not been used operationally since then.Moreover , the IDF wanted to emphasize that this was the first time David's Sling was used in defense of Tel Aviv.It was only used on Wednesday as an opportunity to test its status in a situation where there were fallback alternatives.Along with the Iron Dome against short-range rockets and the Arrow defense system against long range missiles , David's Sling is the middle element of Israel's missile defense .",ceasefire talks ongoing as over 500 gaza rockets shot at israel
2024-05-05 17:15:07.387,jpost,"Israel is today a polarized society , but special events like Holocaust Remembrance Day ease this division due to , in part , an increase in feelings of sadness and underscores the pivotal role of memorial days in temporarily reducing societal divisions and safeguarding cohesion.These were the findings of a new study by researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem ( HU ) led by doctoral student Tamar Gur and colleagues , under the guidance of psychology Prof . Eran Halperin . It delved into the emotional dynamics surrounding this day marked on Monday this year that detected a substantial decline in & ldquo;affective polarization during the commemoration . & rdquo;They published their paper in the journal Political Psychology under the title & ldquo;A group that grieves together stays together : Examining the impact of Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel on affective polarization . & rdquo;Affective polarization is defined as the tendency to dislike , distrust , and maintain hostile attitudes toward supporters of other political parties or ideologies . In its extreme form , affective polarization may pose a severe threat to these groups&rsquo ; cohesion , functionality , and existence.Relation between memorial days and unityThe association between memorial days and national unity has long been recognized . In poignant speeches delivered during these commemorations , there&rsquo;s always a powerful call for unity , underscoring a common identity and shared commitment to the memory of a collective history . Against the backdrop of polarization that has beset Israel since January 2023 & ndash ; characterized by growing divides among groups with identical national identities & ndash ; the need to strengthen these bonds of common identity is vital , the researchers said.Research has shown that the Jewish public is very involved in and moved by Holocaust Remembrance Day : In one survey , 93 % of them reported standing at attention in honor of the fallen during the commemorative siren.The study examined the effects of memorial days on emotional responses and their potential role in mitigating affective polarization . Affective polarization , defined as the tendency to harbor negative attitudes and hostility towards supporters of opposing political ideologies , poses a grave threat to societal cohesion and functionality.The study was based on extensive surveys of participants , gauging their feelings and attitudes before , during , and after the day of remembrance . The results showed that the prevalent sadness associated with the day significantly decreases polarization of moods and feelings that often manifest as distrust or hostility towards those with differing political or ideological views . & ldquo;Out of the great crisis we grew , became stronger , and established a glorious country , and we should not take this for granted , & rdquo ; said Rosa Bloch , a speaker at a Holocaust Remembrance Day event three years ago . & ldquo;As a woman who loves people , I will add and say that I call for unity of the nation . & lsquo;Love your neighbor as yourself&rsquo ; is a principle that should be with us every day , every hour , because our strength is in our unity . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Memorial days serve as a reminder of our shared humanity and collective responsibility towards preserving the memory of our past , & rdquo ; Gur commented . & ldquo;Our findings underscore the pivotal role of sadness in temporarily reducing affective polarization and safeguarding societal cohesion . & rdquo;They said that despite its limitations , this research holds far-reaching implications . & ldquo;Sadness , though often deemed an unpleasant emotion , offers substantial personal and group advantages in specific contexts . Memorial days exemplify how national groups can harness the power of sadness to bolster cohesion and preserve group integrity . & rdquo;This profound impact on societal cohesion underscores the importance of collective memory in healing national wounds and building a resilient community , the team concluded . & ldquo;It highlights how remembrance and shared grief can serve as powerful catalysts for social solidarity , promoting a more harmonious coexistence among various social groups . & rdquo ; & nbsp ;","remembrance days bring israelis together in their grief , even if only temporarily"

2024-05-24 01:57:16.137,jpost,"Statistics have shown that only 13 percent of ultra-Orthodox youth of conscription age neither study nor work , 39 percent only work , and 19 study and work . Finally , only 29 percent meet the requirements of Torah study . This is according to a report by a team commissioned by the Defense Ministry to examine the integration of ultra-Orthodox youth into the IDF.The team was appointed by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and headed by former commander of the Israel Air Force , Maj . - Gen . ( res . ) Eliezer Shkedi , with the goal of examining the possibility of integrating and raising the number of ultra-Orthodox recruits to the IDF.The Israel-Hamas war led to an increase of ultra-Orthodox drafting to the IDF . A significant jump in the number of recruits was registered in the last recruitment cycle in May , where 250 ultra-Orthodox enlisted as combat soldiers in the Paratrooper , Givati , and Netzah Yehuda infantry brigades , and for the first time , in the Border Police ( Magav ) . Another hundred enlisted as combat support soldiers . Following the ongoing war in Gaza and tensions along the northern border , and in light of additional security challenges such as the West Bank , the Iranian threat , the Syrian front , and distant fronts in Iraq and Yemen , the IDF needs a massive increase in manpower in the IDF.The team , led by Maj . - Gen . Shkedi , compiled a report with 15 sections to be implemented to increase the number of recruits . "" We got the impression that there is a desire among the ultra-Orthodox to contribute . There is a profound change in attitude . There is tremendous potential to advance the issue of recruiting the ultra-Orthodox population to enlist in various recruitment routes for the IDF , "" said Shkedi.Among the sections that promote the scope of recruitment is the opening of all systems in the IDF for the benefit of recruiting ultra-Orthodox in all branches and units . "" Our motto must be ' We want you , we need you , and we respect you , ' "" Shkedi stated . He further elaborated , "" We decided on a maximum number of positions for all ages . We do not want to send the ultra-Orthodox recruits straight to the military rabbinate . We need to create an open grade . And we will do everything to not change their lifestyle . "" Report offers solutions and adjustments for ultra-Orthodox enlistment&nbsp;One of the sections in the report deals with the fact that action must be taken to make military service accessible to ultra-Orthodox youth , among other things , by opening short-term preparatory programs of between two weeks and a month . Two such preparatory schools have already been opened with the Jewish Agency and there is a plan to open dozens of similar preparatory programs.It was also decided to change the screening at the recruiting office and adjust it for the ultra-Orthodox , such as adjusting the aptitude and other tests that many in this group are not technologically sufficient to conduct . Another aspect is to ensure that these aptitude and placement tests are not administered by female soldiers , as well as making various adjustments on bases.Another section deals with the construction of service tracks for combat support , with an emphasis on units such as Intelligence , Air Force , and the Navy . It was also decided to make information accessible on the internet to learn about all the tracks that stand before them in the IDF . At the same time , there was a recommendation to establish a special directorate in the Defense Ministry for the issue of encouraging the recruitment of the ultra-Orthodox population into the IDF , as well as appointing a special adviser to the IDF Chief of Staff for ultra-Orthodox affairs , similar to the adviser for women and gender affairs.Defense Minister Yoav Gallant , in response to the report , stated , "" Thank you to Maj . - Gen . Eliezer Shkedi , for important and groundbreaking action on expanding the ranks of the IDF and strengthening Israel's security . Together with the dedicated team and in cooperation with the Chief of Staff and the Director General of the Defense Ministry , we brought good news to the people of Israel and in particular to members of the ultra-Orthodox sector - the possibility to enlist in any unit in the IDF and preserve their way of life . & rdquo ; "" Already in December 2023 , the team began its work , in order to bring about a significant recruitment of ultra-Orthodox , starting with the upcoming recruitment cycles . This is good news for the Israeli public - the security establishment will continue to support any effort that will lead to the expansion of its ranks . In the days when the IDF is fighting in seven arenas , near and far , in order to maintain Israel's security and deal with its needs , we must make sure that everyone who is needed can join , this is a real operational need and a necessary and vital action .

2024-05-14 13:10:39.280,jpost,"Israelis today have shiny biometric passports , but those from the nascent Jewish state in the 1950s were hand-written and issued well before computers existed ; they were also marked in French : & ldquo;Valid to any country except Germany . & rdquo;Israelis who wanted to visit Germany had to file a request . That condition was then deleted by an official drawing a line through the words.After the Reparations Agreement was signed between Israel and West Germany in 1952 , the passports became valid for travel to all countries.The history of travel documents in IsraelWhat about travel documents for those living in Mandatory Palestine before and after May 14 , 1948 ? Beginning almost a century ago , Jews and Arabs who lived in the land were able to acquire a Palestine passport issued by Britain . These were valid for two years only , and the text was written in Hebrew and French.The first Mandatory Palestine passport was issued in 1925 to Pinhas Rutenberg ( 1879&ndash;1942 ) , a Russian Jewish engineer who went on to build the mandate&rsquo;s First Jordan Hydro-Electric Power House aka Rutenberg Power Station or Naharayim Power Station at the confluence of the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers . This dammed hydroelectric power station operated from 1932-1948 in Jordan ( then , Imarat Sharq al-Urdun , the Emirate of Transjordan , a British protectorate from 1921-1946 ) , supplying power to Mandatory Palestine.When the British Mandate of Palestine ended on May 15 , 1948 , the State of Israel began issuing travel documents with an initial validity of two years & ndash ; and printed and filled out in Hebrew and French & ndash ; until the Knesset passed the Israeli nationality law in 1952 . & nbsp;Thereafter , the first Israeli passport issued was in the name of Golda Meir , who at the time worked for the Jewish Agency and was soon to become Israel&rsquo;s ambassador to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ( USSR ) , aka the Soviet Union . ",before biometrics : israel's earliest passports and travel documents
2024-05-05 13:01:27.170,jpost,"& nbsp;Israel's Holocaust commemorations this year have a searing significance for six elderly survivors now deeply scarred by the Hamas attacks of Oct . 7 that sparked the ongoing Gaza war.The killing and kidnapping spree by Palestinian infiltrators on a Jewish holiday morning shook the sense of security of Israelis - not least , those who had witnessed the state emerge as a safe haven after the Nazi genocide.For Bellha Haim , 86 , the upheaval is especially profound.Her grandson Yotam - like her , a resident of a village near the Gaza border - was taken hostage by Hamas and managed to escape , only to be accidentally shot dead by Israeli soldiers.The trauma drove Haim to return to her native Poland , which she had fled with her family as a child during World War Two , and where she will , on Monday , take part of the "" March of the Living "" at the site of the Auschwitz death camp.The annual ceremony is timed to coincide with Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day.A cohort of university presidents and chancellors from America and Canada will participate in the 2024 International March of the Living . The event will be headed up by former US Secretary of Education Dr . John King , now the Chancellor of SUNY , and Yeshiva University President Rabbi Dr . Ari Berman.Dr . King leads a system of 64 colleges and universities in New York State , the largest comprehensive system of public higher education in the United States.The trip will come to a close after Holocaust Remembrance Day , during which participants join Holocaust survivors on a solemn march from Auschwitz to Birkenau to commemorate the Nazi horrors . "" I never went back , and I wasn't convinced to go back , "" Haim said during a meeting with other survivors ahead of the trip . "" But this time , when they told me that they were connecting the Holocaust and what I call the ' Holocaust of October 7 ' - because then in the Holocaust we ( Jews ) were not a united people , we didn't have a country , and suddenly this pride of mine that has been broken , my pride in my people and my country that was shattered in front of my eyes - I said , ' This time I will break my oath , and I will go out . ' "" As a teenager , Yotam had taken part in the annual Auschwitz vigil , and Haim said she saw the event as a chance for communion with him and other victims of the Hamas attack . "" I will go out in the name of Yotam , who marched there when he was in high school , and I will go out there to shout out the cry of the slain , of the babies , of all my good friends that I will never meet again , & rdquo ; she said.Yelling in Arabic and gunfireAmong those joining her will be 90-year-old Daniel Louz , whose hometown , Kibbutz Beeri , lost a tenth of its residents to the Palestinian terrorists.In some ways , he said , that ordeal was worse for him than the European war , when he escaped Nazi round-ups in his native France , although half his family perished in Poland.After he awoke to the sound of Arabic yelling and gunfire , "" I was constantly busy with surviving and figuring out what to do , "" Louz said . "" In France , as a child , I suffered all kinds of post-traumas that I&rsquo;ve learned to cope with . But in Beeri , it was the first time that I felt the fear of death . "" A neighboring house was riddled with bullets . Louz's was untouched . He says he imagined the souls of the six million Holocaust victims steering Hamas away from him . "" They probably wanted me to be here to tell this story , "" he said , weeping.Other Holocaust survivors participating in the March of the Living include Smil Bercu Sacagiu , 87 , whose home was hit by a rocket from Gaza , and Jacqueline Gliksman , 81 , whose home was torched by a Palestinian infiltrator . "" What was left , and luckily the terrorist didn&rsquo;t see it , is my grandchildren , "" she said , referring to gold figurines on a necklace she was wearing . "" That's the only thing I have left . "" Before he was seized , Haim's grandson left a text message : "" They&rsquo;re burning down my house . I smell gas . I'm scared . "" She said that it reminded her of a Holocaust-era song in Yiddish , invoking centuries of pogroms , with the refrain "" fire , Jews , fire . "" A veteran campaigner for peace with the Palestinians , Haim said she would no longer pursue that activism . "" I'm not able to , "" she said . "" Now what interests me is only my people . & rdquo;Jerusalem Post Staff contributed to this report . & nbsp ;",hamas killing spree haunts holocaust survivors participating in ' march of the living '
2023-07-06 15:53:03.710,jpost,"An IDF soldier was murdered in a Palestinian shooting attack near Kedumim in the northern West Bank on Thursday , with the terrorist also later killed.The soldier was identified as IDF Staff-Sergeant Shilo Yosef Amir , a 22 year old from Meirav in northern Israel and a soldier in Sayeret Givati.Hamas's al-Qassam Brigades declared responsibility for the attack , saying that it was conducted as a response to the recent Israeli operation in Jenin and the tearing up of the Quran in Urif.The al-Qassam Brigades added that the attack aimed "" to tell the criminal Zionist Minister [ Finance Minister Betzalel ] Smotrich that al-Qassam almost knocked on your door . "" Smotrich lives in Kdumim.Around 3:45 p.m . , security forces connected to Kedumim identified a suspicious white van that was driving in circles around the outskirts of the yishuv.The suspicious movements of the vehicle led those security forces to send out a mix of a civilian security official and a group of four IDF soldiers to converge on and approach the van.IDF Brig . Gen . Avi Blut said that the heightened awareness of the Yishuv's security complement both in detecting the van and in keeping all of the gates to the Yishuv closed , may have saved significant civilian lives since it meant the terrorist could not penetrate the Yishuv or achieve any surprise.The civilian security official arrived at the vehicle first and initiated a request for the driver to produce identification.The driver continued to act suspiciously but did not yet open fire.How the attack unfoldedVery shortly after , the four IDF soldiers arrived and started to approach the terrorist.At a certain point during their approach , the terrorist opened fire , mortally wounding the commander of the four IDF soldiers , who was hit with one deadly bullet.Magen David Adom initially indicated that the soldier was severely wounded after the IDF confirmed reports of the attack , but later confirmed his death.Though the terrorist also fired in the direction of the civilian security official , he was not injured.There were conflicting reports about potential other incidents in the area as the terrorist attacker initially escaped on foot , fleeing toward the Jiat junction.The remaining three IDF soldiers pursued him and managed to bring him down with gunfire.Additional soldiers arrived on the scene shortly after and ensured that he was neutralized . & nbsp;Blut said that the IDF has identified the terrorist , but will only release his identity later , after determining whether he was a lone wolf attacker or whether he was directed to carry out the attack by a terror group.The IDF has already determined that no other attacker was involved in the incident and that the terrorist did not come from Jenin.Blut said that once the terrorist's identity is publicized , the IDF will also initiate processes related to his family and potentially demolish his house.This is a developing story .",idf soldier murdered in terror shooting near west bank settlement of kedumim
2021-05-12 18:49:36.643,jpost,"International Criminal Court Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda on Wednesday threatened both Israel and Hamas with new possible war crimes allegations relating to the ongoing conflict . & nbsp ; In a series of tweets , Bensouda wrote , & ldquo;I note with great concern the escalation of violence in the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , as well as in and around Gaza , and the possible commission of crimes under the # RomeStatute . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Further , she wrote , & ldquo;I echo the call from the international community for calm , restraint & amp ; a stop to the violence . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Next , she said , & ldquo;I recall that my Office&rsquo;s investigations will cover all sides and all the facts and evidence relevant to an assessment of whether there is individual criminal responsibility under the Statute . My Office will continue to monitor developments on the ground and will factor any matter that falls within its jurisdiction . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; In February and March , the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber and Bensouda herself each made decisions pushing forward with a full criminal probe of Israel&rsquo;s and Hamas&rsquo;s conduct . & nbsp ; Regarding Israel , Bensouda was already probing the 2014 Gaza war , the 2018 Gaza border conflict and the settlement enterprise . & nbsp ; With regard to Hamas , she was probing the 2014 and 2018 conflicts . & nbsp ; However , once an ICC probe is launched , it is open-ended and can add new events into the investigation as they occur . & nbsp ; Bensouda&rsquo;s tweets on Wednesday were a reminder to Israel and Hamas that for the first time ever , the current major conflict is taking place in the middle of an already ongoing full ICC criminal probe . & nbsp ; Back in 2014 , there was no ICC process in place , and the former prosecutor , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , had rejected jurisdiction over & ldquo;Palestine&rdquo ; in early 2012 . & nbsp ; However , by late 2012 , the & ldquo;State of Palestine&rdquo ; received a heightened nation , nonmember state status from the UN General Assembly . & nbsp ; In early 2015 , the Palestinian Authority used this new status to request a probe of Israel , and Bensouda spent the next five years carrying out a preliminary review of the issue . & nbsp ; Between December 2019 and February of this year , the issue was litigated before the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber , which eventually endorsed Bensouda&rsquo;s moving to the next stage , the full criminal probe . & nbsp ; Previously , Bensouda issued warnings to Israel over the 2018 Gaza border conflict and over a plan to evict the residents of Khan al-Ahmar . & nbsp ; Israel indefinitely postponed the eviction of Khan al-Ahmar residents , and the IDF acknowledged that it altered some of its tactics during the 2018 conflict . & nbsp ; But neither of those situations came anywhere near the magnitude of the current conflict , which could expose Israel on a much greater level . & nbsp ; Israel rejects ICC jurisdiction on a variety of grounds , ranging from rejecting the idea of Palestine being a state , the IDF&rsquo;s self-investigating mechanisms superseding any ICC probe , the fact that Israel never ratified the Rome Statute , and the idea that building houses in the disputed West Bank cannot be a war crime , and is an issue for peace negotiations . & nbsp ; Bensouda steps down next month and will be replaced by Karim Khan , who Israel hopes may be more sympathetic to its views , but who to date is an unknown variable .","icc threatens new war crimes allegations against israel , hamas"
2024-06-06 11:04:38.250,jpost,"Not many people alive today have done as much for human freedom and the Jewish people as has Natan Sharansky . Sharansky , born in Donetsk , Ukraine , was the spokesman for the human rights movement , a prisoner of Zion , and a leader of the struggle for the right of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel . After applying to "" make aliyah , "" Sharansky was arrested on charges of treason and espionage . He was convicted in a Soviet court and served nine years in the Gulag . Following massive public campaigns by the State of Israel , world Jewry and leaders of the free world , Sharansky was released in 1986 , and emigrated to Israel , on the very day of his release.In his first years in Israel , Sharansky founded the Zionist Forum to aid Soviet immigrants in their absorption into Israeli society , and , in the 1990s , he founded the Israel Ba'aliyah party to represent the interests of Russian olim . He served in four successive governments , as a minister , and as deputy prime minister.From 2009 to 2018 , he served as chairperson of the Jewish Agency , and upon his retirement , received the Israel Prize for promoting aliya and the ingathering of the exiles . Sharansky also received the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1986 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2006 . He is the only living non-American citizen who is the recipient of these two highest American awards.Clearly , there is almost nothing in the Jewish world and in Israel that Sharansky has not been involved with , in one way or another , in the course of his life . At this challenging time , it seemed appropriate to discuss current events with Sharansky.These are difficult times for us , as a people , as a country , as a society . How have you felt since October 7 ? "" Of course , there was a huge failure here of our intelligence , our army , and our politicians . We were deeply invested in incorrect concepts . For me , it all started back with Oslo . I said then , that the idea of our bringing a dictator to the Palestinians who would make peace with us & mdash ; because we would make him a dictator by giving him a lot of money & mdash ; did not make sense . It's just the reverse : the dictator would need us as enemies , and therefore would not make peace with us . "" It continued even with the withdrawal ( from the Gaza Strip , A.W . ) . The idea was that we would be here , and they would be there , and we could control them that way . As ( Prime Minister ) Arik Sharon explained to me , if they turned militant and tried something , we would go in . I resigned from the government at that time , because of the disengagement . "" "" We have become a united society""Sharansky believes it was the spirit of Oslo that caused Israel's leadership , at all levels , to act incorrectly , and led to the failures of October 7 . On the other hand , "" This event was a reminder of how good it is that we have the State of Israel . There is a poet who wrote that the proximity of Israeli Memorial Day and Holocaust Day helps us understand the price of the world with a state and without a state . When we were in the Soviet Union and there was a surge of antisemitism , could we could fight , go to court ? No ! We just had to get by , take refuge in mathematics and physics , perhaps they'd leave us alone . Even after 100,000 people were killed ( in pogroms ) , there was nothing to be done but to run away to America . "" Now , we're fighting , "" Sharansky declares proudly . "" We have transformed from a most divided society into a united society . We are all sitting in one tank , and our appreciation for the State of Israel has been renewed . And as much as we called the young generation a TikTok one , it turns out this generation is giving us a lesson in true Zionism , in such a noble , such a brave way . So , good things are happening . I am optimistic about the future of the State of Israel , but far less optimistic about what is happening in America and Europe . "" Sharansky tries to explain what he thinks is happening nowadays in the West , both in the Jewish context and the wider one . "" The Jews feel they are part of the liberal world , and the liberal world thinks the progressives are their partners . For years , I wrote about the fact that the real crisis in the United States is not between Republicans and Democrats , but between liberals and progressives . I said that one day , the liberals would realize they were not partners . "" In his various roles , Sharansky met with many Jews in the West . "" I asked Jews at universities , in the most elite places , if any of the organizations they had developed relationships with , befriended over the years , expressed any sympathy after October 7 . I'm not asking for anything more , just sympathy . They looked and looked , and found one right-leaning organization at Yale that participated in mourning . That's it . This means that all the organizations on the progressive left see the terrible things that happened on October 7 as part of a legitimate struggle . This is a big change ; antisemitism came out in a big way . "" Sharansky says in the past he had theories about how to prove a connection between antisemitism and anti-Zionism . "" Today we no longer need a theory , we don't need to show anything , it's in everyday life . I hope that the new generation of American Jews will go out in public and fight over this it . "" You said you were encouraged by the unity here , but there is a repeat of the tensions we saw before October 7 , isn't there ? "" There is a comeback , but a group of politicians and a group of journalists are behind it . The masses are not with them today , unlike what happened until October 7 when half the country thought the other half was trying to steal their democracy and the other half thought they were trying to steal their Judaism . Today , the people feel that it is important for everyone that there is a Jewish state , and also a free country , and you can see this with almost every bereaved family of a fallen soldier . Also , we see that , in the moment of truth , suddenly , the real and deep things that unite us still exist . They aren't lost . "" Marxism is backI spoke not long ago with a researcher named Izabella Tabarovsky who believes that the anti-Zionist rhetoric and progressive left activity stems from the Soviet attitude towards Zionism and Israel . Do you agree with this analysis ? "" Yes , of course . I think Izabella is right . There is a large group of people who left he Soviet Union who understand much better than most Americans what exactly happened in America . The whole post-modern ideology that divides the world into oppressed and oppressor is neo-Marxism in its most primitive form . In the studies of critical race theories & mdash ; which have become the Koran of the progressives & mdash ; if you replace race with class , you get the ideology of the Bolsheviks in the Soviet Union . There , too , the whole war is between one good side and one bad side , between the proletariat and the capitalists . The capitalists are always wrong and should not be given freedom of speech & mdash ; aside from those who are considered politically correct . And the capitalist world should be destroyed completely , and a just world will be built on this . It is very sad that Marxism has come back after such a huge failure . It has come back via the academy because it could not come back through politics . It is always like that , the bad ideas always come from the academy . "" When did I first realize that this is what had happened ? "" Sharansky asks , and immediately answers : "" Twenty years ago , I was touring universities in America , and I told Arik Sharon , who was then prime minister , that this was where the most important struggle for Israel's future was taking place . I saw there for the first time that students were afraid to say what they thought because it would not be good for their careers . And as soon that starts , it starts taking us towards Soviet life . "" How do you overcome this madness ? "" Liberal students , first of all Jewish students , should enter the arena , stand up , and take a strong position . A position that says we are Jews , we are Zionists , Zionism is part of our identity , and the United States , according to its principles , must protect us . It is already starting ; 500 students in Columbia issued a very firm letter , and every day more students are joining , and I believe it will reach more universities . In addition , there are now investigations into how Qatar gives tens of billions of dollars to universities . This must be investigated . "" Correspondence with NavalnyIn February of this year , American journalist Bari Weiss revealed that during April 2023 , Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny , who was apparently killed in prison , corresponded with Sharansky . Navalny had written to Sharansky , saying he had read "" Fear No Evil , "" Sharansky's account of his years of struggle against communist rule . In the letters , he also quoted from the Bible : "" That which hath been is that which shall be , "" and said , among other things , that he "" continues to believe we will fix it , and that one day in Russia there will be what has not been . "" How did your relationship with Navalny come about ? "" About a year and a half ago , I suddenly received a letter from Navalny through his lawyer . "" A physical letter ? "" A handwritten letter that was photocopied and sent to my email . "" And what did he say ? "" He said , we didn't know each other , but he was writing to me as a reader to a writer , because he had read my book and was amazed at how much the situation had gone back to what it was when I was in the Gulag . During my years in prison , I spent 450 days in isolation , Navalny was already almost 300 days in isolation . It is clear from his letter that he is a free man , and of course I wrote that I admired him and his struggle . It was clear this was a very strong man , that he was optimistic , not because of what was happening with him , but that he was optimistic about the victory of his struggle . We had an exchange of letters , and we had a good feeling towards one another "" . What was in his last letter to you ? "" In the last letter , right before he entered the isolation cell again , he wrote to me : ' I received a letter from you , and I don't know when I will be able to write to you again , so I'm simply writing to you . ' What was interesting is that he ended the letter with the words ' Next year in Jerusalem ' in Russian letters & mdash ; the last words in my book . As if he wanted to join the optimism of Jewish history . "" You are one of the personages most identified with the word "" freedom . "" What is freedom to you ? "" Freedom is when you can do and say things you believe in . In this respect , in prison I was much freer than those who interrogated me . During the interrogations , I really liked to tell anti-Soviet jokes about Brezhnev . The guards were almost bursting but could not laugh because of the consequences . And I would say to them , ' Well , you want to tell me that I'm in prison ? You're in prison & mdash ; you cannot laugh . ' For me , freedom is very much related to identity , because we found the strength to fight for our identity only when we became a free people , and vice versa . "" The fact that the West itself has lost its identity is connected to everything we see now . And here Israel has a special role . We are part of the free world , yet still insist on maintaining our identity as a Jewish state . "" How did you feel about the judicial overhaul , the conduct of the government , and all the demonstrations ? "" I thought both sides were wrong . There was no reason for Netanyahu , who came to power for a four-year term , to try in two months to introduce a law that changes things so significantly . I agreed with most of the elements of the reform except for a few things , but they wanted to do everything immediately . It was a huge mistake . Let's say that in the first week Bibi didn't understand that [ Minister of Justice Yariv ] Levin was rushing something , okay , but after ten weeks you can already understand it was a mistake . "" On the other hand , the demonstrations shouting to the whole world that this is the end of democracy , that this is a dictatorship , that this is the end of women's freedom & mdash ; I think that's irresponsible . Once one of the organizers of the demonstrations asked me , ' Why don't you come to our demonstrations ? ' I asked , ' Why do you shout that this is the end of democracy ? ' He told me , ' Without it , we wouldn't be able to bring along so many people . ' That's cynical . "" Too many years in powerSharansky has known Benjamin Netanyahu since he was a diplomat . Asked his opinion about Netanyahu and his performance these days , he replies that "" Bibi is a great politician , a great leader . It's not by chance that he has been at the head of this country for so long . When I was in the government , I saw how he fought to liberalize the economy . Thanks to him & mdash ; and I was there & mdash ; there's the Taglit-Birthright project , not to mention the fact that he was first in the world to understand the Iranian threat . And when he was Prime Minister and Minister of Finance , he began advancing the sanctions . He also took office after the Oslo Accords , when there were many commitments in place , and he managed to moderate them . "" Following this praise , Sharansky comes to his problem with Netanyahu : "" I think it's not good when a politician stays in power for too long . I told this to Bibi when I left my position at the Jewish Agency . He asked me ' Perhaps you'd like another term ? ' I answered , ' Bibi , more than two terms isn't healthy . ' He asked , ' Are you telling me that ? ' and I said , ' Yes , you too . ' When you're in a post like that for a long time , you begin to feel that the best thing for the country would be for you to stay in power & mdash ; and then that becomes the goal . And there is no doubt that he has also contributed to the divisiveness here . The fact that he started using the word ' leftist ' as word describing an enemy is very bad . "" He should have finished up , and prepared a new generation to replace him , but he felt that there was no-one who could replace him to save the country , and thought ' I need to stay in power ' . And this , I think , is a mistake . But I will emphasize again that his contribution to the country has nonetheless been great . """,sharansky : in prison i was freer than my interrogators

2024-05-05 12:56:06.120,jpost,"Israel's cabinet on Sunday voted unanimously to shut down the Qatari news outlet Al Jazeera's operations in Israel , nearly six months after first announcing its intentions to do so due to security concerns related to the Israel-Hamas war.The decision , which requires recertification every 45 days , includes shutting down Al Jazeera broadcasts in Arabic and English ; shutting down Al Jazeera's offices in Israel ; seizing equipment used for its broadcasts ; and limiting access to its websites.Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi signed an executive order soon after the vote passed , and it thus came into effect immediately.Videos on Sunday afternoon showed law enforcement officials arriving at Al Jazeera's Jerusalem offices in the Ambassador Hotel . HOT , one of Israel's major television service providers , announced that it had shut down Al Jazeera's broadcasts . Another provider , YES , ran the following message on the blacked-out channel , "" In accordance with the government decision , the Al Jazeera station's broadcasts have been stopped in Israel . "" In a joint statement following the vote , Netanyahu said that "" Al Jazeera correspondents have harmed the security of Israel and incited against IDF soldiers . The time has come to eject Hamas's mouthpiece from our country . "" Karhi added , "" We will take immediate action against those who use freedom of the press to harm the security of Israel and IDF soldiers , and incite to terrorism in time of war . There will be no freedom of expression for Hamas's mouthpieces in Israel . "" Al Jazeera condemned the decision , calling it a "" criminal action . "" "" Israel's suppression of free press to cover up its crimes by killing and arresting journalists has not deterred us from performing our duty , "" it said.Decision goes against Mossad chief's positionIsrael's National Security Cabinet was scheduled to hold the vote already on Thursday , but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed it due to concern that the vote would not pass . According to a spokesperson for Minister-without-portfolio MK Benny Gantz's National Unity party , this was because Mossad chief David Barnea requested that the government delay it for a few days , so as to avoid possible negative diplomatic ramifications relating to Qatar , a mediator between Israel and Hamas in negotiations for a deal to free Israeli hostages . The decision required approval from either the government's National Security Cabinet ( NSC ) or the general cabinet , and Netanyahu chose to move forwards on Sunday in the general cabinet.National Unity's three ministers were not present at the meeting and did not take part in the vote . The party said in a statement that its ministers "" support closing Al Jazeera's broadcasts and even announced that they would support its closure in the recent ( national security ) cabinet meeting . "" However , "" Bringing the topic forward this morning for a vote in the government meeting , is a correct decision but with terrible timing , that could undermine efforts to exhaust the ( hostage deal ) negotiations , and stems from political considerations , "" the party said.Karhi countered by accusing the centrist National Unity of acting like a "" fifth column "" within the government . According to Karhi , the decision received "" unequivocal validation "" by all security officials . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp;The decision was based on a law that Israel's Knesset ( parliament ) passed on April 2 , which expires on July 31 . The legislation will therefore need to be extended if the government wishes to extend the banning of Al Jazeera beyond that date . The law itself is also facing a constitutional challenge in the High Court of Justice by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel ( ACRI ) based on its violation of free speech , and the state has until May 15 to file its preliminary response to the court.The government passed emergency executive measures at the start of the war that would have enabled it to shut down Al Jazeera temporarily . These were in effect from October 21 until January 20 . However , the government refrained from implementing these measures during that period , reportedly due to possible negative diplomatic ramifications relating to Qatar.The legislation that passed in April was aimed at giving the cabinet firmer legal footing to move against Al Jazeera . In its decision on Sunday , the cabinet explained that it had classified opinions from the Shin Bet on April 9 deeming Al Jazeera a national security threat . The IDF and Mossad also provided classified opinions supporting limiting Al Jazeera's broadcasts in Israel.According to the law , the decision must be brought before a regional chief justice or deputy chief justice within 24 hours , who then have three days to decide whether or not to change the decision or limit the length of the ban.In its petition to the High Court of Justice against the law , argued that it unnecessarily limited free speech and was thus unconstitutional . ACRI said that while there was no arguing the fact that Al Jazeera ran a "" pro-Palestinian "" narrative , this was not a sufficient reason to shut down the network . In addition , the network provides content from Arab states and includes Israeli Arab perspectives that have been quoted numerously on mainstream Israeli media , indicating that its content was viewed as important , ACRI added . The NGO acknowledged that Al-Jazeera had included content that incited against Israel . Still , the severity of this incitement was no worse than incitement against Palestinians on mainstream Israeli websites , ACRI argued.ACRI filed a request on Thursday that the court issue a temporary order barring the government from deciding to shut down Al Jazeera until the case is heard . The court denied the request , and said it would consider a temporary order after receiving the state's preliminary position .",government votes to shut down al jazeera in israel

"" There are violations by Hamas when they have human shields . But when one looks at the number of civilians that were killed with the military operations , there is something that is clearly wrong , "" Guterres told Reuters NEXT.Israel has vowed to wipe out Hamas , which rules the Gaza Strip , after the terrorists killed 1,400 people and took more than 240 hostages in an Oct . 7 attack . Israel has struck Gaza from the air , imposed a siege and launched a ground invasion.The number of Palestinians killedHamas officials have claimed 10,569 people have now been killed , 40 % of them children . "" It is also important to make Israel understand that it is against the interests of Israel to see every day the terrible image of the dramatic humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people , "" Guterres said . "" That doesn't help Israel in relation to the global public opinion . "" Guterres compared the number of children being killed in Gaza with the toll in conflicts around the world that he reports on annually . "" Every year , the highest number of killings of children by any of the actors in all the conflicts that we witness is the maximum in the hundreds , "" Guterres said .

2024-04-27 09:06:53.557,jpost,"Berlin Blues , an excellent series that recently became available on Yes , is about an Israeli couple , a musician and a writer , who move with their daughter to Berlin.It examines the drama caused by their being foreigners in a place that offers a stimulating artistic environment but is shadowed by the tragic history of the Holocaust . It also shows , very convincingly and sympathetically , how dormant problems in a couple&rsquo;s relationship can be stirred up by such a move.It was created by real-life married couple Itamar Rotschild , a musician , and Dana Idisis , the writer of such series and movies as On the Spectrum and Here We Are , who moved to Berlin with their daughter a couple of years ago . They stayed for about a year , then returned to Israel . & nbsp;Rotschild himself plays Yonah , the musician husband in the series . Shira Naor portrays Talya , his wife , a woman who has published a novel based on the story of her mentally ill brother , and Idisis has a brother on the autism spectrum , who was part of the inspiration for some of her recent work . & nbsp;Given all these similarities , Rotschild , speaking from his backyard in a recent interview , wasn&rsquo;t exactly surprised when I asked how closely the series was based on their actual life . & nbsp;To what extent is the TV series based on real life ? & ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk about the similarities . We moved to Berlin because I wanted the experience of living abroad for a few years . For Dana , it was after the first season of On the Spectrum and we flew there and lived there for a year and a half , with our daughter . We have two daughters now but then we had only one . For me it was nice there , I found myself there , I felt good . & rdquo;So many young Israeli couples spend at least a couple of years abroad that it&rsquo;s practically a rite of passage , but there haven&rsquo;t been many fictional portrayals of this phenomenon . Berlin , with its low cost of living and thriving arts scene , has become a destination for thousands of young Israelis . Rotschild and Idisis thought of that when they lived there , although Rotschild emphasized that despite the superficial parallels , it was not their story . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We knew the feeling of being in Berlin and feeling foreign , but we created the stories , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;It can be complicated in so many ways to live in a foreign country . There are lots of little things that you know how they are done at home , but in this new place , everything is different , and you have a feeling of being an outsider . & rdquo;That feeling puts Yonah and Talya&rsquo;s marriage under a strain : & ldquo;There were all kinds of problems before in their marriage , but they were kind of hidden , but here , in Berlin , everything is amplified . You are still you , but the new setting brings out things that were more under control before . & rdquo;When Talya returns to Israel for a single episode , she is confronted by tough realities of the life she left behind there , notably that there are frequent missile attacks from Gaza during her visit & ndash ; a disclaimer notes that the episode was filmed before October 7 & ndash ; and that her brother and her parents are in denial about the severity of his mental illness . & nbsp;In a particularly harrowing scene , he insists on returning to work at his job at the Ramat Gan Safari after he has been fired , and when Talya tries to take him home , he jumps out of the car near several hippopotamuses . & ldquo;You see that so much is hard for her in Israel , too , how complicated it is for her there . & rdquo;THE RELATIONSHIP of Israelis to Germany is also complicated in all kinds of ways and Berlin Blues deals with that head-on . When Yonah&rsquo;s mother ( Liora Rivlin ) comes for a visit , she can barely contain her anger at her son for choosing to live in the country that persecuted her parents . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Lots of people are & lsquo;anti [ German ] , & rsquo ; because of their parents , people don&rsquo;t want to buy German goods , wouldn&rsquo;t want to buy a German car . I even know people my from my generation who won&rsquo;t go to Germany . . . Yonah&rsquo;s mother has a real issue that is connected to the trauma of what so many Jews went through there , and I think that we tried to show what&rsquo;s behind it , and she isn&rsquo;t just & lsquo;anti , & rsquo ; but you see at the end , with her monologue in German , that she has a real connection to the country because of her parents , she isn&rsquo;t just & lsquo;anti . & rsquo ; & rdquo;Another way that the series differs from his own life , Rotschild said , is that , & ldquo;My music and the music in the series are two different things . & rdquo ; Rotschild is a guitarist and pianist who writes and performs in a folk-rock style . He has released a number of albums and is at work now on a new one , while Yonah is an oboist who gets a position with a Berlin orchestra . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I was never in an orchestra . We thought about what would keep Yonah in Berlin , so that it makes the conflict between him and Talya , who wants to go home , stronger , and we thought of having him be an oboe player . The oboe is an instrument that maybe one or two people in orchestras can play full-time in Israel , but it&rsquo;s hard to make a living at it here . But in Europe , you can make a living at it , there are a lot of orchestras there . & rdquo;Rotschild had never played the oboe and learned enough to look convincing handling the instrument on screen . & ldquo;I had a very good teacher , Shani Shachar , and she taught me how to play it and hold it and how to blow in it and how to clean it and how to get a sound from it . It&rsquo;s a very difficult instrument just to get a sound out of & ndash ; and I&rsquo;m not talking about a beautiful sound , just any sound at all . & ldquo;We did a lot of research to get into the world of classical musicians , to check how it sounds , how it feels , what it&rsquo;s like , because it wasn&rsquo;t a world we knew . It&rsquo;s music that I like , but it isn&rsquo;t music , or a world , that I really know . & rdquo;Rotschild said that the director of the series , Ram Nehari , who worked with them for two years , & ldquo;helped to make the series what is today , he directed it beautifully and also worked on the scripts . He had a big influence on how well it turned out . & rdquo;Rotschild&rsquo;s most important role prior to Berlin Blues was also as a musician , in the series , The Echo of Your Voice . Rotschild played a struggling artist who is the son of an Arik Einstein-like , all-time great performer , just as the Rotschild character&rsquo;s own son becomes a rising star . In an unusual achievement , the three lead actors , Rotschild , Shaul Luria , and Orr Amrami Brockman , shared the award for Best Actor at the prestigious Series Mania competition in France . & nbsp;But when asked whether he intends to continue acting , Rotschild said , & ldquo;Acting is fun for me . It&rsquo;s a kind of vacation , like taking a vacation from myself . & rdquo ; Despite his success as an actor , he said , & ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my profession . It seems to me that people who are professional actors have to take parts that are not what they really like , that are not that good , because that&rsquo;s what they do . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I&rsquo;m not there . I only do things I like . So if someone brings me a part that I can connect to , I&rsquo;ll do it gladly , it&rsquo;s fun when you feel that you can express yourself through it . But I&rsquo;m not an actor . I&rsquo;m a musician who sometimes acts . & ldquo ;",new tv series ‘ berlin blues ’ brings berlin to life
2023-10-24 21:45:14.447,jpost,"Hamas fired a massive barrage of rockets at central Israel throughout the day Tuesday , setting off alarms in dozens of communities and cities around Tel Aviv , in the Negev , in the northern West Bank , and in the Gaza border area . There were hits in Alfei Menashe and Holon , with three people moderately wounded.The barrage indicates that Hamas continues to possess long-range rockets , 18 days into the war . IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi addressed the nation from the southern border : & ldquo;I want to be clear , we are ready to invade , & rdquo ; he declared , as the IDF continued to weigh the timing of the ground war in coordination with the political echelon.Expanding on the delay , which has puzzled some , Halevi said , & ldquo;At this stage , there are tactical and strategic factors that are allowing us more time to improve and to exploit every minute to be more ready . & rdquo ; In contrast , & ldquo;with every minute that passes for the other side , we are attacking the enemy more , killing their fighters , killing their commanders , destroying their infrastructure , and collecting more intelligence for the next moves . & rdquo;Continued rocket barrages toward IsraelThe North was hit as well with rocket barrages on Tuesday , as Hezbollah fired an anti-tank missile at the border community of Shtula , and fired on Elkosh . An IDF UAV struck two terrorist cells that carried out rocket and mortar shell launches toward IDF posts , as well as a cell threatening Mount Dov.Israel continued to strike at Hamas targets in Gaza , including heavy hits in the northern part of the Strip , in the Shati camp , Shejaia , Jabalya , and other areas . IDF Spokesman Brig . - Gen . Daniel Hagari added that the military continues to warn Gazans to emigrate to and remain in southern Gaza , where they can access humanitarian aid.Israel also dropped more leaflets over Gaza & ldquo;urging Palestinians to give them information about hostages being held by Hamas and offering them protection and a reward , & rdquo ; Reuters noted.The IDF added on Tuesday night that it attacked a terrorist frogman cell attempting to cross into Israeli territory by sea . Meanwhile , it continues to prepare for the expected ground incursion , which includes preparing as many units as are needed with training refresher courses in urban combat as well as general training for reservists . So far , 300,000 reservists have been called up since the war began.While Hezbollah has deployed anti-tank missiles , rockets , mortars , drones , and small arms to threaten Israel , the IDF has continued to eliminate terrorist squads attempting to infiltrate . The IDF said five cells were eliminated on Monday and more were taken out Tuesday afternoon.The Alma Research and Education Center noted that & ldquo;since the start of the war in the northern arena , there have been two infiltration attempts , 200 rocket and mortar launches , and 30 ATGM [ anti-tank missile ] attacks&rdquo ; from Lebanon.Across the region , Iranian-backed proxies used drones to attack US forces in Iraq and Syria . The Houthis in Yemen , backed by Iran , have used drones as well.The IDF said , & ldquo;During combined operational activities , IDF tanks , helicopters , and artillery struck anti-tank missile launchers and observation posts in which Hamas terrorist operatives were located . Simultaneously , IAF helicopters and fighter jets struck terrorist infrastructure located in a multi-story building , as well as additional anti-tank infrastructure.Striking terror outpostsIn Gaza , the IDF killed a number of Hamas terrorists in at least 400 strikes against terrorist targets overnight , in addition to the 320 it struck between Sunday and Monday . The overall number of airstrikes has not been released , but it is likely approaching 10,000.French President Emmanuel Macron visited Israel on Tuesday , as the US continued to bolster forces in the region , amid reports that Israel was cautioned against a ground operation taking place without a plan for the day after , as well as reports that the US is concerned about a wider regional conflagration.Overall , threats from Iran have been reduced in Iranian official media and rhetoric over Sunday to Tuesday . While Hezbollah continues to regularly list casualties , it also appears to have slightly reduced its attacks ; it may have lost as many as 30 terrorists since October 7 . & nbsp;In the Gulf , news reports are increasingly speculating as to what will happen to Gaza after the conflict ; Al-Ain media discussed how the Palestinian Authority might return to Gaza . Lebanon has also reportedly put together an & ldquo;emergency plan&rdquo ; to help civilians in case of a larger conflict in Lebanon.Halevi&rsquo;s comments were the most emphatic acknowledgment to date of criticism from the IDF of the government for delaying the counter-invasion of Gaza.Nevertheless , the assessment is that Hamas is being put off balance by the continued aerial war . & ldquo;We are keeping them in tension , & rdquo ; said Halevi , suggesting that the longer Hamas waits for the Israeli invasion , the more stressed it will become.He also cited the complexity of trying to rescue 220 hostages . & ldquo;Israel is at the height of a war that was started by the Hamas terrorist organization . It will regret it . It is starting to regret it even now , & rdquo ; Halevi said.He has been briefing different units in the field and listening to fighters and commanders . & ldquo;We have trained for this , we have outfitted the troops with quality tools , among the most advanced in the world . But most importantly , we have the best warriors for these missions . & rdquo ; & nbsp ;","after heavy hamas rocket barrage , halevi vows ‘ we are ready ’ for ground incursion"
2024-03-26 01:15:24.903,jpost,"The continued reality that 90 % of adult haredi ( ultra-Orthodox ) males are exempt from national service has no moral , halachic , or security justification . This was true before October 7 and has become a critical issue since . Having formed part of the debate during the period of legal reform before the war , it is now a burning public issue.There are many people responsible for the fact that the haredi community has been exempted for the 76 years since the creation of the State of Israel , starting with David Ben-Gurion and including pretty much every government since.But in the very real-world crisis in which Israel finds itself , the issue has crystallized due to the huge sacrifice made by conscripted and reserve soldiers since October 7 and the army&rsquo;s need for more combat forces . With the immediate and long-term requirement for battle-trained soldiers going up , the haredi leadership is doubling down on its rhetoric.Currently , the only thing standing between real change in government policy and the untenable status quo is the political needs of the prime minister , backed by the religious Zionist parties in the government . It is time for the moral masses on the political and religious right to call their leaders out and demand a change of course . The fact that any change will take time to have an impact only increases the urgency for action.The country needs more soldiers , in particular combat soldiers . In order to achieve this , the army is demanding that conscripted soldiers extend their service and that those in reserve be called upon for extended periods of service for the foreseeable future . There is a limited number of populations that can provide additional pools for recruitment , namely , female soldiers ( whose number in combat roles is on the rise ) and haredi men.The government is in a bind . Public opinion is now strongly and emotively against any extension of the blanket exemption for over 60,000 haredi yeshiva students , and on the other hand , the government is politically beholden to the haredi parties , which as yet remain firm in their resistance.The law allowing for the haredi exemption actually expired in June 2023 , and now there are several cases before the Supreme Court calling for two measures as a result . One is to force the Defense Ministry&rsquo;s hand and start calling up haredi men , and the second is to halt any financial support for the yeshivot , with students now legally required to enlist . Both outcomes are political causus belli for the haredi parties.Raising the age of exemptionIn an attempt to stave off these sanctions , the government is mulling a decision that will , among other things , increase the age of exemption to 34 . This means that any haredi not performing national service will not be legally allowed to work until they are 34 . Currently , the age is 26 . This will turn the clock back to 2010.Dr . Gilad Malach of the Israel Democracy Institute is an expert on government policy on conscription and haredim . He notes that , in contrast to what is now being claimed by the government , not only will this not increase the number of haredim joining the IDF but it may cause the opposite . According to Malach , all the data shows just the opposite . & ldquo;History and experience have shown us that it will also have a negative impact on the quality and quantity of the haredi participation in the employment market . The later haredim seek training or employment , the less likely they will be able to train for highly skilled work , & rdquo ; he says.Alternatively , reducing the age of exemption causes more haredim to seek employment at a younger age , with the ability to skill up in order to exploit the opportunity . Instead of raising the age , Malach and all the experts would prefer that the government reduce it.Yoav Gradus , director-general of the Budget Department in Israel&rsquo;s Ministry of Finance , issued a letter to the defense minister on Sunday , following the publication of the proposed government decision . Reports in the press stressed that the decision was being driven without the normal professional input from relevant government ministries , which only increases the sense that the decision is purely political , without any real prospect of a positive impact on either increased participation in the army or the economy.In the letter , he is quite specific : & ldquo;From an economic point of view , the condition connecting the non-conscription of men and their non-integration into the labor market led , as mentioned , to the creation of employment patterns that produce long-term damage to the entire economy . & rdquo;Shaked reflects on decade of failureIn a stunning and unusually candid moment from an Israeli politician , former minister of justice Ayelet Shaked , who was closely involved in the conscription law passed in 2014 , admitted that all her hopes for the law and the process it was meant to create have failed . & ldquo;At the time we passed the law , the annual haredi cohort of boys numbered 8,000 , and 1,200 were conscripted . After 10 years , we didn&rsquo;t reach ( our target of ) 6,000 . Indeed , the cohort has grown to 12,000 , and the number of conscripts is 1,800 , & rdquo ; she told a recent conference at Tel Aviv University . In the meantime , the army&rsquo;s needs have grown dramatically . & nbsp;No magic bulletThere are no easy fixes to this entrenched problem . Nobody expects or believes that masses of haredim will join the IDF immediately , no matter what policy is employed by the government . However , the need to shift course is now . At the very least , the government has to begin the process.For this to happen , one of two things will have to occur . Either the Likud and the Religious Zionist Party will have to force the issue with the haredi parties or there will have to be elections with the ball dropping into the lap of the next government . Urgency demands that this happens under the auspices of the current government . Politics determines that this is an unlikely outcome.For the first to happen , Netanyahu and Smotrich will have to switch course , the risk being that the haredi parties will bolt the coalition and the government will fall . On the other hand , Gantz , Eisenkot , and perhaps Defense Minister Gallant can force their hand by either demanding a different policy or delivering an ultimatum to leave the government . Of course , elections will delay the process.One way or another , there will soon be irresistible public pressure for change . This will have to include reduced government budgets supporting yeshivas for haredim who do not serve and increasing budgets for haredi institutions and programs that encourage national service , whether military or civilian . The government must support schools teaching core studies and social responsibility and reduce budgets to schools that are not preparing their students to make a full contribution to Israeli society . & nbsp;Nobody wants to see Haredim stop being loyal to their religious identity , but most Israelis are in no mood to see the status quo extended.The writer , a founding partner of Goldrock Capital , is the founder of The Institute for Jewish and Zionist Research .

2024-06-18 11:21:42.280,jpost,"Israel&rsquo;s High Court of Justice on Tuesday held a significant hearing in a petition put forth by several organizations against a law passed by the coalition in late December 2022 that expanded the authorities of the soon-to-be , now-National Security Minister , MK Itamar Ben-Gvir.The case reached its climax after a series of procedural stages and was heard in front of an expanded bench of nine High Court justices.It was passed in the Knesset on December 27 , two days before the current government was sworn in , after Ben-Gvir set it as a precondition for his joining the coalition.The law was an amendment to Israel&rsquo;s Police Law ( also known as the Police Ordinance ) . It anchored the police&rsquo;s subordination to the government , as well as allowing for the national security minister to set policy and general principles.Further , it enabled the minister to set policy regarding investigations after consulting with the attorney-general , the police commissioner , and the officers responsible for investigations.The leading petitioner , the Movement for Quality Government in Israel ( MQG ) , argued at the hearing that Ben-Gvir&rsquo;s conduct since taking office proved that the law was dangerous , as it de facto enabled the minister to intervene in operational matters , including in the treatment of individuals protesting against the government.MQG chairman Adv . Eliad Shraga said to reporters outside of the courtroom , & ldquo;We have seen everything that we have warned against come true in the last year and a half . We have seen the minister meddling in the policy regarding investigations ; we have seen the minister meddling in operative law enforcement policy ; we have seen the minister meddling in appointments policy ; and we have seen the minister running the police . & rdquo ; & ldquo;This is an abnormal situation where the police are effectively a militia at the service of the minister . We live in a democratic country , and so we insist that the amendment to the Police Ordinance be repealed&mdash;that the Israel Police be an institution of the state , subject only to the rule of law , & rdquo ; Shraga punctuated.Other petitioners included Yesh Atid MKs Yoav Segalovitz and Mickey Levy , both of whom served in senior roles at the police in the past ; the Labor Party ; the Association for Civil Rights in Israel ( ACRI ) ; and the High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel.Adv . Aner Hellman of the Attorney-General Office&rsquo;s High Court of Justice division argued during the hearing that the part of the law regarding investigations needed to be struck down as unconstitutional since it did not include provisions to protect citizens from violations of human rights.Hellman added that the part of the law giving the minister the ability to set policy should also be struck down unless the court clarifies what exactly qualifies as & ldquo;policy . & rdquo ; According to Hellman , & ldquo;policy&rdquo ; must be defined in advance and cannot be set during a specific addition . Moreover , the legality of these policy decisions must first be deemed legal by the ministry&rsquo;s legal adviser.A lawyer for Ben-Gvir , Adv . Nadav Haetzni , argued in response that the fact that Ben-Gvir has made controversial policy decisions since taking office does not mean that the law itself is unconstitutional . According to Haetzni , the minister should have the right to set general policy , and if the minister gave specific operational orders , these could be challenged in a separate process in the High Court.In reference to this , Hellman and others argued that illegal operational directives given by Ben-Gvir could not always be appealed in real time and that the potential for human rights violations was serious enough to render the law unconstitutional . The law should especially clarify that the police , and not the minister , were responsible for making decisions in real-time regarding protests against the government.Ben-Gvir attended part of debateBen-Gvir attended part of the debate and at one point even interrupted his attorney , saying that he would not agree to be a & ldquo;plant , & rdquo ; i.e . , a passive observer of the police&rsquo;s actions . This continued a claim made by Ben-Gvir on Tuesday that outgoing Israel Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai and the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office were colluding against him to prevent him from applying his policies.Indeed , the hearing came during an ugly public spat between Shabtai and Ben-Gvir . Shabtai complained to the attorney-general in recent weeks that , on numerous occasions , the national security minister had illegally bypassed him and spoken directly to lower-ranking police officers.Ben-Gvir , in turn , accused Shabtai of not functioning properly since the results of the Mount Meron tragedy report were made public in March.The report found several officials , including Shabtai , former public security minister Amir Ohana , and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , personally responsible for the catastrophe in which 45 haredim were crushed to death during a mass Lag Ba&rsquo;omer event at the grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai in 2021.Shabtai himself attended the hearing and wished to speak , but the judges denied his request . Shabtai instead spoke to reporters outside . & ldquo;I came here today out of a deep concern for the future of the Israel Police as a professional , apolitical&rdquo ; member of the police , without any specific agenda , Shabtai said . & ldquo;I did not come here against some minister or other . I came simply to present our positions about the significance and consequences of this law . Expanding the authorities [ of the minister ] could affect democracy in the State of Israel , & rdquo ; he emphasized .","high court begins hearing on ben-gvir law , police chief expected to oppose"
2021-06-23 21:46:51.817,jpost,"A month after Operation Guardian of the Walls , the IDF continues to struggle to maintain calm in the West Bank . With Israel&rsquo;s attention focused on the Gaza Strip , the flames of violence in the West Bank are at risk of exploding . & nbsp ; According to data released by the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) , there were 592 attacks in the West Bank and another 178 in Jerusalem in the month of May , compared to a total of 104 in April ( 80 in the West Bank and 24 in Jerusalem ) . The May attacks included 401 firebombings , 33 pipe bombs , 87 arson attacks , 47 small-arms fire , two grenade attacks , one vehicular attack and others . & nbsp ; One Israeli civilian , Yehuda Guetta , was also killed in a shooting attack at the Tapuah junction in early May by 44-year-old Muntasir Shalabi . & nbsp ; Most of the attacks that took place were not carried out by groups but by lone wolves . Those kinds of attacks , the IDF has admitted , are much more challenging to thwart than attacks planned by groups . If you don&rsquo;t have an organization , you don&rsquo;t have the signature of the preparation of the specific attack . & nbsp ; Despite the challenges , the great majority of attacks have been thwarted by security forces . But the high number of thwarted attacks also indicate that the flames of violence are growing in the West Bank . & nbsp ; While there have been significantly fewer vehicular attacks as well as stabbings and shooting attacks against IDF soldiers , they remain a major threat , especially toward drivers on the roads shared by both Palestinians and Israelis . & nbsp ; According to the IDF , shooting or vehicular ramming attacks are more likely to be carried out by young men , and children are behind many cases of stone throwing . & nbsp ; Along with the high number of attacks against Israeli targets , a report by Ynet news found that 34 Palestinians were killed over the past month , & ldquo;more than during any month in the past 10 years . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Comparing the past month to the height of the wave of knife and vehicular-ramming attacks that took place in 2015-2016 , an average of 26 Palestinians were killed every month . & nbsp ; SO WHAT&rsquo;S happening ? & nbsp ; With the cancellation of the May Palestinian elections in late April , the public has lost all faith in their leaders who they say have abandoned the cause a long time ago . Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas , they say , has remained silent about the beating of protesters and worshipers by Israel . & nbsp ; The reestablishment of the illegal settlement of Evyatar has led to repeated violent clashes between Israeli security forces and local Palestinians . Four Palestinian teenagers have been killed in recent weeks . & nbsp ; Like on the Gaza border , Palestinian youths have been taking part in night disturbances with loud riots and setting fires to tires . In one video uploaded to YouTube , demonstrators chant & ldquo;Greeting from the steadfast village of Beita to the steadfast cities in Gaza . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Evyatar was reestablished by settlers in April on land that historically belonged to the Palestinian villages of Beita , Kabalan and Yatma . Residents have been barred from the land for decades by the Israeli military for security reasons . & nbsp ; The IDF has made it clear that the outpost will be demolished , with the IDF&rsquo;s Central Command writing that & ldquo;the Evyatar outpost was established illegally , and everything was done in complete violation of the law . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; But , even when it will be demolished , locals aren&rsquo;t holding their breath . They know that another illegal settlement will likely be built on another hill . & nbsp ; And while the fighting between Israel and the terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip ended , the initial reasons behind Hamas&rsquo;s rocket fire remains : clashes on the Temple Mount . Last week nine Palestinians were wounded by sponge-tipped bullets and stun grenades used by Israeli police when they clashed at the holy site . & nbsp ; While rockets are not raining down on Israel , incendiary balloons have caused dozens of fires to rage across southern Israel . & nbsp ; Hamas has repeatedly warned that it would once again fire rockets into Israel and restart hostilities over developments in Jerusalem . Terrorist groups on Tuesday warned that if Israel does not allow humanitarian relief into the blockaded enclave , they will once again resort to violence . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We warn the Israeli enemy and its allies of delaying the lifting of the siege . The enemy will not succeed with its extortion policy , and we will not sit back as our people are pushed over , & rdquo ; the groups said in a statement quoted by Israeli media . & nbsp ; Hamas leader Yayha Sinwar , who met with Tor Wennesland , the UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process , said Monday that the talks failed , and accused Israel of extortion , urging Palestinians to resist . & nbsp ; & ldquo;It was a bad meeting , & rdquo ; Sinwar said . It was not positive at all , and we clarified to the [ United Nations ] delegation that we would hold a meeting of Islamic and national factions in Gaza to decide our next steps . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; So while the world watches as southern Israel burns from balloons launched from Gaza , the flames are growing just as deadly in the West Bank . Israel needs to get both fires under control before it&rsquo;s too late .",shin bet reports dramatic increase in west bank attacks on israelis
2023-11-26 16:10:58.753,jpost,"Against the backdrop of the ongoing 46th day of the war against Hamas , the question arises of how the terrorist organization perceives the large-scale ground operation carried out by the IDF in the Gaza Strip.In a conversation with Yinon Magal and Barak Seri on 103FM , Zvi Yehezkeli , the head of the Arab Desk at Channel 13 , commented on the mindset of Hamas since the outbreak of the conflict.What were they thinking when they committed the horrific massacre on October 7 ? "" Killing Jews is Yahya Sinwar's strongest instinct . We are currently in the midst of a military operation , with the army actively engaged , showcasing an incredible fighting spirit . "" Now , let's discuss the future . As long as there is a political entity in the Gaza Strip , you will always have Hamas . You cannot eradicate Hamas ; it's deeply engrained in the Palestinian identity , more so than Fatah or anything else . If the situation in the north Gaza Strip were to replicate itself in the south Gaza Strip & ndash ; with refugees seeking protection elsewhere and finding host countries & ndash ; leaving the Gaza Strip without Hamas and a large population will be impossible . "" It's either Hamas or the people . Eventually , whoever governs the Gaza Strip will never accept your existence . No Palestinians , in any form , neither the Palestinian Authority nor a reformed Authority , will acknowledge your presence . "" What do you propose for the day after ? "" What has happened in Gaza can also happen in the West Bank . We have a zero-sum game with the Palestinians , and if we fail to realize this , it will consume us . Even in Judea and Samaria , my friends , it's just a matter of time . "" Just ask the residents of settlements ; they know this is coming their way . Palestinians passing by the fence warn us , ' We will do to you what they did to you in Gaza . ' I receive calls from Haredi individuals living in Beitar Illit , telling me , ' The Arabs are coming , and Gaza is a precursor . ' "" Understand that something has fundamentally changed regarding Palestinian existence . They have achieved what Nasrallah did in 2000 ; they managed to enter , kill , and massacre , and we did nothing . "" Does witnessing the ongoing events in Gaza not make them think twice ? "" Their concern is not for the residents . Yahya Sinwar doesn't care that two million people have become refugees . It simply doesn't matter to him . He believes it is a noble cause , something greater than himself , and it would be a miscalculation if he doesn't pursue it . "" Hence , even if you push it towards the West Bank , even if it's true that Abu Mazen doesn't incite them for jihad , the public will . Is Jenin no longer like Gaza ? Is Nablus no longer like Gaza ? These are small places that have embraced jihad . Jihad holds greater significance for them than anything else , even if it brings them down and backfires . "" Yehezkeli also said , "" Gaza , before the massacre , was in a state of development . They built infrastructure and thriving buildings . Yet , they are willing to destroy all of it , reducing it to rubble , just to fight you . They know that eventually , you will feel remorse over their situation and leave . "" There's an Arabic saying , ' If you want your stocks to rise , deal with a Jew . They will always take care of you . ' The mercy of the Jews is something Arabs praise & ndash ; their compassion . They know we won't turn the tables ; they know we are merciful . A soldier said to me , ' Jews kill to survive , while Arabs live to kill . ' That's the difference . "" "" Every day the token falls to us , we are in the Middle East . This war is not a month or two , I think something strategic has happened here , the State of Israel is about to go through a huge process for the next few years . You will not stop seeing soldiers here in reserves and with weapons . "" This will not end friends , it will not end in Gaza , it will continue to Judea and Samaria . We have many more arenas . What , do you think that Nasrallah has finished his story ? "" he asked.Part of the arguments for not launching a preemptive strike and a second front against Nasrallah and Hezbollah was that "" we will dismantle Hamas "" so that those in the north will see what we are doing and not want to enter.Are you saying it makes no impression on them ? "" If you end Gaza in a ' wow ' way , everyone will step back and say , ' Listen , the Jews did something that is beyond their nature , and that's it . ' "" What is beyond nature ? "" What is beyond nature ? That no Palestinian refugees remain in the Gaza Strip . "" What ? Where will the two million go ? "" 200,000 to 10 countries , what's the problem ? Germany took in four million Syrian refugees , Europe took in another two million , Lebanon took in two million from Assad , Jordan took in Egypt . Those who protect the Palestinians all the time , what's the problem if they take some Palestinians ? What's the problem ? Why can't they ? "" You will not be able to establish your control and for the State of Israel to be safe , as long as you have an entity there that will always threaten you . Or you will once again build shields and protected rooms , etc . "" How is Dahlan ? Is he planning to return to Gaza ? "" I don't know . He's a star in Israel and among the Americans , but I think they don't understand either . Everyone who took care of the Gaza Strip in recent years must hold themselves accountable .

2020-12-29 21:16:05.783,jpost,"Relationships developed between Israel and Qatar to provide sufficient funding to Hamas and avoid an economic collapse and war in the Gaza Strip could be the engine for normalization between Jerusalem and Doha , The Jerusalem Post has learned . Pressed that in November , Qatar rejected any imminent normalization with Israel , sources told the Post confidently that this would likely change during the incoming Biden administration&rsquo;s term . Further , they said that close coordination between Israel and Qatar to facilitate sufficient funding for Hamas to keep Gaza&rsquo;s weak economy from collapsing will likely be the key to moving Doha to a normalization deal . Ironically , even as Hamas is committed to Israel&rsquo;s destruction and periodically fires rockets at Israeli towns and cities , the strange dynamics with Gaza&rsquo;s rulers could help bring a legitimacy coup for Israel with the state that runs the influential Al Jazeera network . Qatar has long been a focal point for many parties in the Middle East and Doha has been in a diplomatic and economic war with Saudi Arabia and other moderate Sunni Gulf countries since June 2017 . In mid-December , Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas met with Qatari Emir , Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani , to try to convince him to host a peace conference in 2021 . The idea would be to move the conversation back from the Trump peace plan to the previous conventional Palestinian-Western plans for peace . Surrounding all these contacts with Qatar is the fact that the US maintains close relations , including its key military base in the Middle East , in Qatar . The combination of a US connection along with Qatar&rsquo;s ability to keep Hamas from starting a broad war , as occurred three times between 2009-2014 , was part of what made Israel , through the Mossad , ready to deal with Doha on Gaza issues . This was in spite of Jerusalem&rsquo;s unhappiness with many of the more Islamist causes and groups which Qatar supports , including that it has a strong relationship with Iran . With Israel&rsquo;s approval , and often with Mossad Director Yossi Cohen&rsquo;s personal involvement , Qatar has periodically provided millions of dollars in cash to Hamas to keep its economic situation stable so that it will not want war . When Hamas grew anxious that the payments would end in August , Cohen reportedly even took an especially active role to convince Doha to continue them , despite economic issues in Qatar related to the pandemic . When attacked by some on the Right that the Mossad and Israel are serving as a middle-man to fund Hamas , Cohen has pushed back hard saying that the funds are humanitarian and that complex decisions are preferable to war . Sources also indicated that there could be a breakthrough in unfreezing relations between Qatar and the Saudi-led Gulf states coalition as early as next week , while Trump is still in office . Statements by officials on the possibility of Israeli-Qatari normalization have to date been mixed . In October , US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Qatar but declined to tell the Israeli media anything definitive about whether Qatar would be the next country to normalize ties with Israel or whether the US will sell it F-35 stealth jets . Also in October , Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Army Radio that to preserve its qualitative military edge , Israel will ask the US not to sell F-35 fighter jets to Qatar . & ldquo;For us , our region still hasn&rsquo;t become Switzerland . Israel is the most threatened country , not only in the Middle East , but in the whole world , and as such , we need to preserve our superiority , & rdquo ; he said . In mid-December , Rabbi Marc Schneier , an unofficial envoy for normalization with Gulf states , told the Post : & ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be content until I see Qataris , Saudis , Omanis and Kuwaitis join as well . Then , you will see a transformation . & rdquo ; Qatar is preparing for the World Cup , and Schneier thinks it is a natural fit for Israel . & ldquo;Qataris are very excited about welcoming Israelis for the World Cup , & rdquo ; he said . Schneier has worked on addressing the needs of kosher cuisine in Doha . & ldquo;In regard to the question about Israeli guests coming to watch the games , the Qataris have already said that they will be allowed to do so , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;But I believe that by November 2022 [ the start of the World Cup ] , we will already see relations between them and Israel . & rdquo ; He also said that moving forward with Qatar might require progress with the Palestinians , but that this could also be more likely with the incoming Biden administration .",how hamas could be the engine for qatar-israel normalization

Three suspects cut the border fence and crossed into Israel where they were joined by another four suspects ; they then started a fire inside Israeli territory , which spread to Lebanese territory . & ldquo;The behavior of the suspects indicated that they were planning to commit a terror attack in Metulla , & rdquo ; the military said in a statement .

Yossi Kuperwasser , who formerly headed the research division of the Israel Defense Forces ' Intelligence Corps.At the program's inauguration , Israel's Agriculture and Rural Development Minister , Avi Dichter , stressed the significance of looking beyond language acquisition . "" Beyond learning the Arabic language , it is essential to understand the Arab mindset , which differs from ours . The students of this new course will have a unique opportunity to do so with the expertise of top professionals in the field . I applaud this amazing initiative , which will enable you to represent Israel honorably in the Arab world , "" he said.The JCPA created the program after recognizing a growing need for Israeli students to bridge the cultural divide with their Arab neighbors . This need became particularly evident after the outbreak of the current war when the center actively disseminated information to the international community . "" With the start of the war , the concept has changed , and the Arabic language and culture have become important and even essential tools for every Israeli , especially those seeking to participate in Israel's efforts in the Middle East , "" said Middle East expert and Vice president of the JCPA Aviram Bellaishe . "" This is particularly necessary for analyzing threats and risks in order to understand ' Middle Eastern thinking , ' to build bridges with regional countries and expand the historical Abraham Accords , "" he added . "" Speaking Middle East "" offers a comprehensive curriculum tailored towards Israeli students , which includes courses in spoken Arabic , diplomacy , Islamic studies , and international law.Workshops , field trips , and even a homestay experience with an Arab family are also incorporated . Upon completing their academic specialization , graduates will have the opportunity to join a regional leadership program.The program has attracted over 40 Israeli students from across the country , representing diverse fields such as Middle Eastern studies , international relations , engineering , and computer science.Khaled Abu Toameh , a former Jerusalem Post Palestinian affairs correspondent , course leader , and specialist in Arab society and communication , commented on the program's unique approach for Israeli students . & nbsp ; "" Participants who join the program will meet and interact directly with Israeli diplomats , journalists , and commentators , as well as those from the Arab and Muslim world . At the end of the program , they will not only be able to speak Arabic fluently but also understand regional thinking . & rdquo;What is the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs?The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs specializes in policy , diplomacy , and communication . Since its inception in 1976 , the JCPA has evolved from primarily focusing on regional security , strategy , and international law research.The center actively cultivates both overt and covert strategic partnerships with key figures from Arab and Muslim nations and remains a pivotal force in combating BDS and global antisemitism",changing mindset : new program teaches israeli students arabic language and culture

2022-07-29 11:00:12.697,jpost,"The & ldquo;Maslul Batuah&rdquo ; ( Safe Route ) operation , which set out to stem the tide of crime in Arab communities , spanning joint efforts of nine governmental offices , has recorded impressive strides since its initiation eight months ago.Last year , the violence in the sector exploded to a dramatic peak of 130 murders & ndash ; on average , a person was murdered in Arab society every three days . Weapons seemed to flow freely in Arab towns , in what to locals felt like a lawless land , but since the Safe Route crackdown , the police say they have turned the tides and restored law and order.But are the operation&rsquo;s effects really felt in Arab communities as the police claim?In the enforcement of the operation , mostly in the North , 3,871 suspects were arrested , thousands of weapons were seized , and 1,153 indictments were filed for weapons offenses across Israel.Since the beginning of the year , the police have increased their activity against weapons crimes in Arab communities . In the past half-year ( January-June 2022 ) , the police across the country arrested 3,871 suspects for crimes of armed robbery and shooting , and about 92 % of the suspects arrested were from the Arab community.Also , in the first half of 2022 , at the end of the police investigations , 1,153 indictments were filed against those accused of shooting and assault offenses all over the country . About 88 % of the indictments filed for the offenses of shooting and possession , trafficking and use of weapons were filed against defendants from Arab society.In addition , 31 illegal buildings were destroyed , a total of NIS 10 million was confiscated , and , as part of the fight against road crime , over 8,000 traffic fines with a total value of over NIS 5m . were distributed . & ldquo;Since the beginning of Operation Safe Route , the Israel Police has recorded significant achievements in dealing with crime and violence in Arab communities , in dealings with crimes of extortion through threats and seizures of firearms held against the law . & rdquo;Leon Hirsch&ldquo;Since the beginning of Operation Safe Route , the Israel Police has recorded significant achievements in dealing with crime and violence in Arab communities , in dealings with crimes of extortion through threats and seizures of firearms held against the law , & rdquo ; said Ch . - Supt . Leon Hirsch , head of the Operational Coordination Section in the Police Intelligence Division . & ldquo;The Israel Police has also recorded significant achievements in filing indictments for these crimes which constitute a significant nuisance to the public in Arab communities . Since the operation began , there has been a much higher demand for police services , and we see this in the responses we receive from the residents , & rdquo ; he added.Seizing weapons , arresting criminalsDuring this period in 2022 , tens of thousands of weapons , explosives , ammunition , grenades and other illegal items were seized in towns of Arab communities , including 770 handguns , and more than 100 submachine guns and 350 guns of different types , thousands of items of ammunition , as well as hundreds of grenades , weapon parts and explosives & ndash ; a significant increase when compared to the same time period in 2021.The operation has been carried out so far in 19 localities , including Haifa , Umm el-Fahm , Nazareth and Rahat.After almost half of 2022 has passed , data shows that the extensive operation launched by the police to eradicate violence resulted in success & ndash ; at least partially : until June 5 , 31 people in the Arab community were murdered in Israel , including four women , compared to 50 murdered in the first half of 2021 ( up to May 27 to be exact ) . In total , according to police data , since the beginning of the year , 42 people have been murdered throughout the country , of which , as mentioned , 31 were from Arab society . So far the police have solved only 12 murder cases in the Arab sector this year . The police attribute this decrease in the number of murders in the sector to the operation.Murder on the riseDespite the effort police have put forward , some remain skeptical about the actual effect they have , as murder cases in Arab society continue to rise , hitting 55 murders up until July , according to data from independent NGOs.WHILE POLICE actions are at the forefront of the operation , it is much larger in scope when looked at from a broader lens . Efforts of the Finance Ministry and income tax officials , for example , set out to combat money laundering and illegal loans , which in turn entangle many civilians . & ldquo;Many Arab towns in the North don&rsquo;t even have a bank or any other means of legally handling financial affairs . Left out of options , they turn to organized criminal syndicates , & rdquo;Ola Najami-Yousef&ldquo;Many Arab towns in the North don&rsquo;t even have a bank or any other means of legally handling financial affairs . Left out of options , they turn to organized criminal syndicates , & rdquo ; Ola Najami-Yousef , vice president of the Abraham Initiative NGO , which tracks crime in Arab communities , told the Magazine in an interview.The issue , she explained , is much larger than a simple lack of policing . The Arab communities have long faced neglect from all governmental offices , from finance to education . Residents are often left to their own devices , something that leaves a large vacuum for criminals to fill.Arabs were viewed as a security threat themselvesBefore Safe Route was initiated , Arabs were viewed as a & ldquo;security threat themselves . Even though a lot of these issues were well known to the government , nothing was done , until now . & ldquo;The way Arab society is viewed and discussed has changed ; we&rsquo;re no longer social pariahs , and a wide range of efforts is now being undertaken to give Arab communities what they rightfully deserve as Israeli citizens , & rdquo ; she said.THE PROBLEM with crime in the communities often stemmed from this larger perspective that painted Arabs as a collective threat.Even if a plain citizen got entangled with criminal elements on account of a lack of services , he had no one to turn to when things turned sour , a situation that not only left an opening for crime on its own but also severely hurt the communities&rsquo ; trust in the police , further increasing the reign of criminals.In towns like Nazareth , where Najami-Yousef lives , you could hardly notice police presence , and towns like Jisr e-Zarka didn&rsquo;t even have a functional police station , even though the building for it existed.Now , police are making efforts to increase their presence , understanding that the lack of trust from locals severely impacts how well they could combat crime effectively.The change is certainly being felt.Jasser&rsquo;s police station , which had been vacant until now , is fully staffed , and towns like Rahat and Nazareth are seeing more patrol cars on the streets . Najami-Yousef , a resident of Nazareth herself , even stated that & ldquo;you could even hear less gunfire in Nazareth these days . & rdquo;To further the bond with the community , the Abraham Initiative has organized meetings between teens and police officers from local stations . The change , Najami-Yousef said , is slowly starting to take effect.But when looking at the still high murder rate which claimed the life of 11 Arabs in the last month , one could question the effectiveness of this change . & ldquo;These things take time , & rdquo ; Najami-Yousef explained . & ldquo;It may take up to five years until we would see a practical change in murders . & rdquo;Najami-Yousef even theorized that the latest chain of murders could be a direct response to police efforts , with criminal organizations feeling the pressure and , in turn , attempting to clean house.Police officials claimed , on the other hand , that the operation has attained significant achievements , and that the decrease in the number of murders is felt & ldquo;everywhere&rdquo ; in the Arab sector.One of the reasons for this , according to them , is that budgets are now being diverted to combating violence in the sector , making it possible to strengthen the forces stationed in the Arab communities and also recruit Arabs directly to the police . & ldquo;In the last five years , 800 Muslims have been recruited to the Israel Police . Today the police can react quickly when cases of violence occur , & rdquo ; a police official said . & ldquo;Along with the continuation of enforcement and its deepening , in order to deal with the phenomenon and completely deter it , a multisystemic treatment and a deep-rooted change beyond police enforcement are needed , & rdquo ; said Ch . - Supt . Hirsch . & ldquo;The Israel Police will continue the determined fight in Arab society and everywhere else , all in order to maintain public peace and security . & rdquo ; ■",have israel's police helped stem the tide of arab sector crime ?

This could have a ripple effect since joining the government gave it legitimacy , especially against the protest movement , but that could now change , he said.Netanyahu met with opposition leader Yair Lapid on Wednesday .

There are so many people walking around now with absolute hopelessness , even inside the Likud.The cracks are there , and they will keep forming . This government is failing by every measure . Things are falling apart , and Likud MKs see that . & rdquo;The coalition suffered another attack when United Torah Judaism chairman Moshe Gafni threatened to leave the government if funding for haredi education was not addressed.A kindergarten teacher in Kiryat Shmona was not receiving her salary because she is haredi , while secular teachers in Safed and Ma&rsquo;alot had received theirs , he said in the Knesset plenum . & ldquo;I have to say that there is deprivation [ and ] discrimination , [ and ] it&rsquo;s wrong , & rdquo ; Gafni said . & ldquo;The education system isn&rsquo;t functioning in the North , yet the kindergarten teacher in Safed and the kindergarten teacher in Ma&rsquo;alot received a salary , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;Only if the kindergarten teacher is haredi she doesn&rsquo;t receive a salary .

2022-08-21 16:34:34.633,jpost,"Palestinian security prisoners held in Israeli jails are planning a series of measures this week to protest the alleged failure of the Israel Prisons Service ( IPS ) to improve their conditions.The move could escalate tensions between Palestinians and Israel , especially in the wake of calls by several Palestinian groups to hold rallies in support of the prisoners.What are the claims made by the Palestinians?The prisoners claim that the IPS has failed to fulfill its previous promise to ease severe restrictions that were imposed on them in the aftermath of the jail break by six inmates from Gilboa Prison last year . The restrictions include , among other things , solitary confinement and the transfer of dozens of inmates to other prisons.The prisoners then announced a series of protests against the restrictions and threatened to go on a hunger strike.Last March , however , they agreed to suspend their protests after reportedly receiving a promise from the IPS to ease the restrictions.On Sunday , the Palestinian Prisoners Club , a group that supports the security prisoners , said the inmates would resume their protests on Monday.It said they would refuse to leave their cells for routine security checks & ldquo;as a step of disobedience against the prison administration laws . & rdquo;What's next for the Palestinian prisoners?The next stage of the protests will begin in two weeks when the prisoners are expected to go on an open-ended hunger strike.More than 1,000 prisoners are scheduled to participate in the hunger strike , the group claimed.Palestinian sources said the prisoners who are planning to participate in the protests belong to all the Palestinian factions , including Hamas , Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the ruling Fatah faction headed by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.The sources said the prisoners formed an & ldquo;emergency national committee&rdquo ; after the IPS imposed a number of sanctions on them in response to the Gilboa Prison jailbreak , during which six inmates escaped through a tunnel they dug inside their cell . All the fugitives were later captured by Israeli authorities.Since then , the prisoners claim , the IPS has been moving many of them every few weeks to different prisons as part of punitive and preemptive measures designed to prevent another escape.The Palestinian Prisoners Club called on Palestinians to support the prisoners in their struggle against the restrictions imposed by the IPS.The planned protests come as three security prisoners are continuing their hunger strike in Israeli jails.One of them , Khalil Awawdeh , 40 , has been refusing food for nearly six months . He went on a hunger strike after he was placed under administrative detention ( detention without trial ) .

2024-04-07 21:43:04.017,jpost,"Lines of freshly planted trees . Israeli flags , each at a different height on a stick above where a tree will one day grow , fly in the wind . It&rsquo;s been six months since the Nova festival massacre took place here.On each flag is printed the name of one of the victims who was killed here , or in the nearby forests and fields , during the massacre . Meanwhile , the sound of artillery can be heard in the distance . By this late point in the day , the military had already announced that it was rotating forces out of Gaza.A sense of change , noted by the passage of half a year , can be felt here . Time continues to pass , and each day ends , but there is no closure for the families , who are left in limbo while Hamas continues to hold 134 hostages.On Sunday morning , families of the Nova victims gathered at the site . They talked of the feeling of abandonment they experienced , especially from the government ; they talked of pain , of getting treatment for that pain . They spoke about how this massacre could have been prevented , and how difficult it is to return to life.Right then was when the news broke that a mourner&rsquo;s wreath was sent to the family of 19-year-old hostage Liri Albag , blaming the government for the lack of a deal . The Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) later said it suspected Iranian forces were behind it . It was as if the news hammered home just how deeply wrong it is that this is still the situation six months later.How can it be that six months into the war the hostages are held just across the border from where I am standing?Gaza is not very large , so wherever you stand along the border , you are always a few miles from the coast and not far from Rafah . There are 134 people across the border ; IDF units are being withdrawn . Israeli citizens were promised that & ldquo;there won&rsquo;t be any more Hamas&rdquo ; when the war was over , and that military pressure would lead to the release of the hostages . From the border , it is obvious that neither has come to pass.For me , Sunday was a return to a border I&rsquo;ve been to many times since October 7 , as well as before the war as well . Back in 2005 , before the Disengagement from Gaza , I visited Netzer Hazani , a settlement in Gaza near Khan Yunis.Border region became a target for HamasAfterward , this border region became a target for Hamas ; rockets rained down on Sderot . This a place where there were many wars : in 2009 , 2012 , 2014 , and briefly in 2021 ; it always carried dangers . At Kibbutz Nirim , a resident told of threats dating back to the 1970s . There was always a threat from Gaza , but there were also times of peace and efforts at coexistence.The sense on Sunday , at Nova , is that all that is broken . The festival grounds today are made up of various memorials , like the new section of trees that will grow and an area of photos of the victims , staked in the ground so that each victim has their area.Besides the few monuments , such as some benches and individual make-shift memorials people have left , or graffiti on a concrete bunker , much remains as it would have been before the festival . There are trees with no undergrowth ; there is a dirt road running down Route 232 , which runs parallel to the border . It was on this dirt road , from the festival grounds to the main road , where cars would have been stacked up on October 7 after the festival organizers stopped the music and told everyone to run and hide.I look around among the trees and think about the thousands of people fleeing ; their desperation and confusion . The area is familiar to me from the many videos that came out that morning ; the bathrooms where people hid , the bar where people were massacred , the fields that people tried to drive through and flee through , the rescuers & ndash ; like the Davidians & ndash ; who came and saved people.Six months later , this conjures up the ghosts of the past , the spirits that roam this forest now . Nearby Kibbutz Mefalsim had almost 1,000 residents on October 7 . Like Kfar Aza , it was a place people wanted to live . The residents in many of these communities say that these kibbutzim were 95 % heaven and 5 % hell & ndash ; before October 7.Today , many of them are empty and lack residents & ndash ; proud , peace-loving people who were evacuated . At Mefalsim , there is a sign supporting the & ldquo;Kaplan&rdquo ; protesters , the anti-Netanyahu camp . These kibbutzim are proud of their heritage . In a small building housing the archive of Mefalsim , there is a photo of the bolt-action rifles acquired by the Jewish state via Czechoslovakia in 1948 that helped defend Israel.On October 7 , the members of the security team , using modern rifles , defended this community successfully from the terrorists . In many cases , the terrorists assigned groups of 30-40 men to attack each border community . When they didn&rsquo;t succeed in some places , there was no second wave . When they did succeed , such as breaking into Kfar Aza , waves of men came from Gaza to loot and murder.In Sderot , terrorists shot upon entry , firing bullets at the streets , targeting the police station in a battle that went on for hours into the night . The building eventually burned down . Residents had to hide indoors for several days amidst fear that infiltrators were still inside . Eventually , the city of 30,000 was evacuated . Six months later , it recovered a lot : many residents returned , and there were even traffic jams downtown . But the signs of war remain & ndash ; soldiers stand at the city entrances , checking cars.In Ofakim , around 30 minutes away from Gaza by car , one particular neighborhood saw an intense gunfight ; more than two dozen people were killed in different incidents . In total , around 50 residents of the city were killed , some in a bus for retirees that was traveling to the Dead Sea from Ofakim through Sderot . The bus was attacked , and the people were killed . Police officers in Ofakim were killed as well . In one neighborhood , the terrorists attacked several homes . Residents helped defend the city and eventually , the terrorists were hunted down.Back on the border with Nirim , the small , 240-person community , it is quiet , but eerily so , like a ghost town . The kibbutz minimarket has been reopened , and the customers are mostly soldiers who come over from units stationed nearby . Several green parrots inhabit a tree , apparently escaped pets . Other former pets are wandering around , including a cat that wouldn&rsquo;t stop following me . Wild dogs had infiltrated from Gaza on October 7 , following the marauding looters.In contrast to Sderot and Nova , fields of memories , Nirim is almost deserted , the burned homes on one side of the kibbutz unchanged since October 7 , cleared on October 10 and 11 of bodies.In the background , like a whisper , ring concerns about what comes next in Gaza , with the IDF decision to pull out Battalion 98 , though the military remains steadfast in its goals , holding as a stark symbol of a lack of strategy , a symbol that haunts these roads.I drive back along the 232 , the same road the terrorists would have driven on ; it is quiet today . Six months ago , this was a road of death . No matter how much the fields are full of green today , and the orchards of oranges are pregnant with fruit , this place will always hold the massacre it witnessed . & nbsp ;","reporter's notebook : the gaza border , six months after oct . 7"

IDF soldiers were called to the scene alongside police after the body was found . The Samaria Regional Council referred to the incident as a terrorist attack , adding that Hurgan was found overnight with & quot;her head crushed . & quot ; & nbsp ; & quot;A dear woman so full of kindness , goes out in the afternoon in the center of the State of Israel to exercise a minute away from her home , and is murdered by vile people in such a cruel way , & quot ; said the head of the Samaria Regional Council , Yossi Dagan . & quot;I ask @ @ @ what barbarians , like in the Middle Ages , what cruelty to hack the face of a 52-year-old woman with a rock in cold-blood ? What evil are we facing ? @ @ @ & quot ; He added : & quot;I want to say clearly to these barbarians from the Palestinian Authority in front of the whole world : you will never break us . The settlements in Samaria will flourish and grow and build together with the whole State of Israel , because you in the barbaric Palestinian Authority chose death and we chose life . You act like barbarians from the Middle Ages & ndash ; and we are in 2020 and the people of Israel will win . & quot ; & quot;The late Esther Hurgan was brutally murdered when she went for a run near her home , & quot ; said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in response to the incident . & quot;The security forces will get their hands on the killer as soon as possible and we will bring him to justice . I would like to send my deepest condolences to the family . & quot ; & quot;I send my deepest sympathies to the Horgan family on the horrific murder of Esther , of blessed memory , & quot ; said Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz in response to the incident . & quot;Israel&rsquo;s security forces are working to find the despicable murderer and take him promptly into custody . We will never accept a reality in which human life becomes dispensable . & quot ; President Reuven Rivlin commented on the murder , saying : & quot;This is a hard , heart-breaking morning with news of the cruel murder of Esther Hurgan , who left her house yesterday and did not return . A full life of wonderful works & ndash ; of home and family , of creativity and care & ndash ; has been cut short by a beast in human guise . I have full faith that our security forces will get to the despicable murders and that justice will be done . I embrace Esther @ @ @ s family , her children and their father . We are with you in this time of such deep grief . & quot ; & quot;Esther went out yesterday as she was used to , to walk in nature , which she loved so much here around the settlement , & quot ; said Benyamin , Esther @ @ @ s husband . & quot;No adventurous deeds , a walking trail like every normal place in the country & ndash ; and she did not return . It does not suit her , so full of life and light and love for everyone , and all this is cut off in an instant . Who can do such a thing ? & quot ; & nbsp ; & quot;We should all be here in the settlement in the regional council , all the people of Israel , and give the appropriate Zionist answer to acts of destruction and killing with more light , more life , more construction , more creation , and more action on the ground for our children and all the people of Israel , & quot ; he stressed . & nbsp ; & quot;Esther raised a family for glory , loved her grandchildren and now they will have no mother , no grandmother , & quot ; the bereaved husband said . & quot;Esther will be missed by all of us , the family and everyone who knew her . Before I knew what was going on , I got messages from all sorts of people how much she touched them and how much she did . We see the great success of the family and of the community in general , and that is largely due to her . & quot ; & quot;We start the morning with the sad news of the brutal murder of Esther Hurgan , a mother of six , last night in Samaria . It cannot be that a woman goes for a run and does not return home , & quot ; said Jerusalem Affairs Minister Rafi Peretz . & quot;I trust the security and police forces to lay hands on the perpetrator of this heinous crime , and I send my condolences to the grieving family . & quot ; & quot;The murder of Esther Hurgan , a mother of six , is heartbreaking . Such cruelty and evil , & quot ; said opposition leader Yair Lapid . & quot;I send condolences to the family and am sure that the security forces will catch the heinous killer . & quot ; & quot;My heart weeps over the murder of the late Esther Hurgan , a mother of six from Samaria & ndash ; all she did was go for a run near her home , & quot ; said Yisrael Beytenu leader Avigdor Liberman . & quot;I send my condolences to the family and hope that the IDF and the security forces will reach those responsible for the murder soon . & quot ;","woman @ @ @ s body found in west bank forest , police investigating terror attack"
2024-03-14 04:04:36.987,jpost,"Winner of the prestigious Rechter Prize for Young Architects , Daniel Zarhy ( 43 ) hails from a prestigious lineage of architects . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I am , in fact , the fourth generation in my family to pursue architecture , & rdquo ; he shared in an interview with The Jerusalem Post , shortly after clinching the esteemed Rechter Prize for young architects.Zarhy won the prize for designing the Faculty of Engineering at the Tel Aviv University . The judges&rsquo ; reasoning stated that & ldquo;The project harnesses innovative engineering thinking , brilliantly intertwining technological and ecological perspectives , and fostering a genuinely distinctive architectural outcome . By creatively reinterpreting the modernist context of the campus structures in a contemporary light , Zarhy&rsquo;s project reflects current global trends . The exceptional level of design and execution showcased by the project stands out prominently , deserving commendation within the Israeli context . & rdquo;Zarhy explained with pride , & ldquo;My great-grandfather was Ze&rsquo;ev Rechter . He met my grandfather , Moshe Zarhy , when they studied together at the Technion . Moshe married Rechter&rsquo;s sister , and they established a firm that later split and was continued by my father . & rdquo;Zarhy graduated with honors from Tel Aviv University&rsquo;s School of Architecture . In 2012 , after working for renowned offices such as OMA & ndash ; Rem Koolhaas in Rotterdam and Herzog & amp ; De Meuron in Basel , he founded Studio PEZ together with Pedro Pe&ntilde;a.The studio has won numerous international competitions , among them : The Jerusalem Courthouse , Ideas competition for a New Opera House in Busan , S . Korea , Broadcom&rsquo;s R&amp;D Center at Tel Aviv University , and most recently the campus for Bern&rsquo;s University of Applied Science ( in collaboration with Wulf Architetken ) . Zarhy said that working abroad has influenced his work tremendously . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I am influenced both by my family&rsquo;s heritage & ndash ; I practically had architecture streaming in my veins since childhood & ndash ; and my work experiance , which gave me new and different perspectives . When you work in a big international firm with people who hail from around the globe , and everyone brings their point of view , it opens your mind , you get new ideas . & rdquo;Zarhy and Pe&ntilde;a established STUDIOPEZ International Architecture Studio in 2012 & ndash ; now based in Basel , Switzerland , and Tel-Aviv & ndash ; as a continuation of their ongoing collaboration while working at Herzog & amp ; De Meuron . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We started off working together in our spare time on two projects and won both . We thought this was it & ndash ; we made it . But the reality was different , both projects never got completed but our partnership survived and flourished , & rdquo ; Zarhy said.Duo begin journeyObserving the world&rsquo;s rapid pace outstripping architecture&rsquo;s ability to keep up , the duo began their venture by plunging into the depths . They successfully took on complex , large-scale projects and paved their way to solving major architectural challenges . Prioritizing simplicity over complexity , their goal in each project is to craft adaptable and people-centered spaces , fostering long-term benefits for communities and cities . & nbsp;Since its establishment , PEZ has been able to showcase this philosophy in a significant number of successful projects and competition awards.The building for which Zarhy received the prize houses both R&amp;D Center for a worldwide leading semiconductor company and the Tel Aviv University Engineering Faculty . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The building combines the engineering faculty with the semi-conductors&rsquo ; research . Excluding the University Gallery , which was built 35 years ago , this is the first building on campus that was built with the idea of opening to the city . & nbsp ; & ldquo;This is part of the changed attitude of the university . The campus perimeter , which for years was made up almost exclusively of car parking , will change to be made of buildings that will be open to the urban surroundings as well as the campus , & rdquo ; Zarhy explained.Challenging the enclosed campus paradigm of the university , the building connects the city and the campus creating a meeting point for academia and industry . & nbsp ; & ldquo;This is the first building in many years that rises from this level and connects the street outside the campus , to the university campus itself , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;You can enter the building , and the University&rsquo;s campus from the street that encircles the university , while on the other side of the ground floor - the street floor visually continues , forming a patio , or an enclosed four-meter deep shaded courtyard which is open to the cafeteria . & ldquo;It is a new model of a research building & ndash ; simple and efficient on one hand , and iconic on the other , & rdquo ; Zarhy said.This building is , at the same time , both iconic by its merit , and simple by design . When looking for simplicity you sometimes come across the best ideas , new ideas , & rdquo ; said Zarhy proudly , stressing that his architectural vision is & ldquo;to make a statement but to keep it simple&rdquo ; . & ldquo;Winning this prize was extremely important for us , & rdquo ; Zarhy concluded .",tau faculty of engineering zarhy and studio pez win rechter prize for young architects
2024-03-29 06:03:54.427,jpost,"MK Benny Gantz's political future remained stable while Netanyahu's leadership remained in doubt : An election poll conducted by Maariv and political pollster Dr . Menachem Lazar uncovered what the political landscape would look like had elections been held today . & nbsp;The National Unity Party , led by MK Benny Gantz , continued to weaken despite its boost following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war and Gantz's entry into the government . National Unity would see a decrease of two mandates ( decreasing to 33 from the last poll's 35 seats ) . At the same time , the Likud Party , headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , slowly recovered two more seats to be positioned at 19 mandates . & nbsp;MK Gideon Sa'ar , who left National Unity and quit the coalition in mid-March to form his own party , New Hope & mdash ; The National Right , is predicted to rise above the electoral threshold with four mandates . & nbsp;Sa'ar remains in , Smotrich outWhile Sa'ar is predicted to remain in the Knesset , others are less fortunate . Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , who heads the Religious Zionist Party , is expected to not pass the threshold with merely 2.9 % of the vote . & nbsp;Other religious parties expected to remain in the Knesset include United Torah Judaism , who could gain up to one more seat , and in general , most parties remain unchanged in the Knesset's seat distribution since the last polls . & nbsp;Regarding potential coalition formations , the opposition and coalition are weakened by two mandates each due to Sa'ar's incoming bloc of four seats , leading to a projected balance of 65 mandates for the current opposition and 46 mandates for the current coalition government . & nbsp;Along with polling for the distribution of mandates in the Knesset , respondents were asked about leadership and who they deemed fit to lead Israel as prime minister . These results remained similar to last week's , with 45 % of respondents supporting a Gantz premiership , while support for Netanyahu as prime minister decreased by four points , currently at 34 % . & nbsp;Dr . Lazar is a political pollster , public opinion specialist , and CEO at Panels Politics , and conducted the electoral poll in cooperation with a panel of internet respondents using the site Panel4All.co.il . & nbsp;The survey was conducted between March 27 and 28 , 2024 , and was answered by 503 respondents representative of the State of Israel's population .

2022-02-06 19:18:38.760,jpost,"The US State Department has informed the father of a World Vision official on trial for allegedly assisting Hamas that it is closely monitoring the case , according to an email obtained by The Jerusalem Post . Mohammad El Halabi , who claims the charges against him were made to delegitimize his humanitarian work , has been detained for nearly five and a half years and has been waiting for a verdict from the Beersheba District Court since closing arguments concluded last July and October . His father , Khalil El Halabi , had sent a letter to the US government to request assistance to free his son or to at least hasten a verdict and a close to the unprecedentedly drawn-out proceedings . In the January 31 email being disclosed now for the first time , the US Embassy in Jerusalem responded to El Halibi , saying : & ldquo;The United States is aware of your son&rsquo;s case and has also covered it in our annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Officers at the Embassy have closely monitored his case and have previously been in touch with World Vision and Mohammad&rsquo;s attorney to learn more about his detention and court case , & rdquo ; it said . & ldquo;We&rsquo;ve also been in touch with the Israeli authorities to express our concerns over the impact his case has had on the shrinking humanitarian space in Gaza , & rdquo ; it added . & ldquo;We will continue to monitor the case closely and raise our concerns with the appropriate officials , & rdquo ; the US Embassy said . In parallel , Mohammad El Halabi&rsquo;s lawyer , Maher Hana , is trying to get him freed from detention pending the verdict , given that he has been in pre-verdict detention for so long . A hearing on the issue before the Supreme Court that had been scheduled for this coming Tuesday has been postponed until February 15 . El Halabi has vehemently denied the charges and accused the prosecution and the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) of manufacturing charges , coercing a confession to undermine humanitarian organizations in Gaza and dragging out the case . To date , only the defendant has been criticizing the prosecution , with the state refraining from responding publicly due to concerns about revealing classified intelligence . El Halabi was indicted in August 2016 for channeling $ 7.2 million a year to Hamas to buy weapons and build attack tunnels . The money was to have been used by World Vision for food , humanitarian assistance and aid programs for disabled children . Neither World Vision nor an Australian government audit found the wrongdoing allegedly uncovered by the Shin Bet . Meanwhile , Israel is trying to convince the International Criminal Court and countries in Europe that its legal system is legitimate and fair to avoid war-crimes trials and combat charges of apartheid from Amnesty International and others . Closing arguments for the prosecution started last spring , but like much of the case , they dragged out for unclear reasons until October . Last March , the Justice Ministry indicated it would release key points of its closing arguments to the public in response to some of the defendant&rsquo;s allegations that his rights had been abused . Ultimately , the ministry decided not to release any information and to postpone that issue at the court&rsquo;s discretion as part of the verdict . Though the ministry claims the court postponed any disclosures , it usually is the prosecution that requests gag orders in the first place . Since last March , more allegations have emerged from El Halabi&rsquo;s side . One is that he was fooled by an undercover informant in detention into confirming details that the informant kept pressuring El Halabi to confirm . According to the defense , El Halabi told law-enforcement officials the confession was coerced from the first moment they raised it with him . The original document recording the confession was lost by the police . The defense has said the case should have been dismissed in light of the circumstances in which the confession was given . The police record of what was said is an inauthentic photocopy , raising questions of a police cover-up , it said . In addition , the defense has claimed that World Vision did not transfer any materials to Gaza at some of the crossing points where the prosecution says El Halabi made illegal transfers to Hamas . Although these allegations are new to the public , the prosecution has been aware of them and responded to them behind closed doors throughout the trial , the Post has learned . The prosecution&rsquo;s responses are classified at this stage , but the prosecution apparently acknowledges having used an undercover informant and would say this is a standard approved tactic and that no illegal pressure was applied . Moreover , the prosecution would point out that the court had already rejected any allegations of a coerced confession earlier in the case and that the only question left for it to settle is how much weight to give the confession . Regarding the allegation of a lost document , it appears the prosecution would likely express regret and reject any conspiracy theories , adding that this is not the first case such an error occurred and that the defense has not flagged any specific issues to invalidate the authenticity of the copy of the confession . Regarding the border crossing , the prosecution would respond that El Halabi was a clever operator and sometimes used different organizations or names to move materials , while using World Vision as his main laundering tool . Last March , Khalil El Halabi told the Post Mohammad El Halabi had & ldquo;brought conclusive evidence and testimonies of the employees of the organization and internal and external international auditors , as well as contractors and even farmers , who all testified that there was no diversion of any funds from the activities of the organization . & rdquo ; El Halabi said this shows that allegations regarding his son misappropriating humanitarian funds for Hamas were unfounded . Further , he said , & ldquo;At least three defense experts confirmed that the existing & lsquo;evidence&rsquo ; is clearly unreliable and untrue&hellip ; based on limited preliminary examination only&hellip ; Due to the confidentiality imposed on me by the state , I am not allowed to comment on the nature of the evidence . & rdquo ; According to Khalil El Halabi , the defense has called three expert witnesses , likely relating to finance or auditing , as well as employees of World Vision , contractors and farmers involved with how the NGO&rsquo;s funds were spent . The defense also claims it did not see all of the evidence . The prosecution would say El Halabi used tactics such as falsifying documentation or concealing the use of certain funds using other entities to hide his use of World Vision as a financial laundering instrument , just as he did with physical transfers of mat&eacute;riels for Hamas , the Post has learned . Further , the prosecution has said even though the public has not seen the full evidence , the defense has . Both sides accuse the other of unconscionable delays relating to fighting over how the trial would take place , what evidence the defense would get to see and the possibility in the earlier years of reaching a plea deal .",us state dept . closely monitoring world vision case verdict

2021-05-06 22:12:55.873,jpost,"& nbsp;Fakhri Abu Diab lives in east Jerusalem , but everything he knows about Israel&rsquo;s capital is different from the one that his Jewish neighbors love . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Anyone who comes to east Jerusalem knows that it is not the same city and not the same language , & rdquo ; said Abu Diab , who is a spokesman for the Silwan neighborhood . & nbsp ; The barrier that once divided Jerusalem prior to 1967 has long since been torn down . Fifty-four years have passed since Israel created a united capital when it wrested control of the eastern part of the city from Jordan during the Six Day War . & nbsp ; Next week , as Israel celebrates Jerusalem Day to mark that victory , few will remember where that barrier really stood , but the scars of the division still resonate in the city . & nbsp ; At issue are not just the cultural and linguistic differences between the Palestinian population that largely lives in east Jerusalem and makes up 39 % of the municipality&rsquo;s 900,000 people . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Geopolitics plays a role . Most of the international community supports a divided Jerusalem , where the eastern part of the city would be the capital of a future Palestinian state . An additional complicating factor is the fact that most of the Palestinians have Jerusalem residency but lack Israeli citizenship . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; But over time , for many Jewish Israelis , the differences have almost begun to appear cosmetic . They walked around a city that easily looks united and whose redivision seems unrealistic and unfeasible . & nbsp ; For Jerusalem&rsquo;s Deputy Mayor Fleur Hassan-Nahoum the city&rsquo;s unity is obvious . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Jerusalem is a city comprised of communities . That is the essence of Jerusalem . It is a city of communities , but it is a united city . What makes it united ? You have one municipal authority taking care of all of its residents , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; That authority is in charge of transport , health , education and public spaces , she added . & nbsp ; & ldquo;That municipal authority , especially in the last few years , has made it a point of being an inclusive authority , where everyone has a voice , and where everyone can approach the mayor and the deputy mayor and can advocate for their community and receive resources for that community , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;On a public level , what we have seen in the last five to 10 years is a city that is more integrated than it has ever been . Ten years ago , you never had a young Arab student working in Fox , & rdquo ; Hassan-Nahoum said , adding that many of the shops throughout the city are staffed by Arab residents . & nbsp ; Today , public space is shared by Jewish and Arab residents of the city , including in coffee shops and gyms . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Whether people admit it or not , whether the detractors can still point fingers at the divided city & ndash ; in essence , in the day-to-day experience for most people , & rdquo ; the city is integrated physically , logistically and relationally , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think our work is finished , & rdquo ; she said , adding that more needs to be done on issues of equity and job placement , particularly in the hi-tech industry , but that is true with respect to any community that has been marginalized , she said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; For many years the governments of Israel , whether left or right , did not know what to do with the issue of east Jerusalem , Hassan-Nahoum said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The Left thinks one day it will be the capital of a Palestinian state , and the right wing is concerned with other issues , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Partially , she said , the problem lay with the Palestinians themselves . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We had a hostile community , with little leadership , manipulated by the Palestinian leadership in Ramallah . It was difficult . I am not saying it was all their fault , but I believe we are in a different place now . The Arabs in east Jerusalem are realizing that they are getting zero , nothing , from the Palestinian leadership , she said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; She credited Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion and former Jerusalem Affairs minister Ze&rsquo;ev Elkin , now a New Hope MK , for making strides in closing the equity gaps between Jewish and Arab residents of the city , including the development of partnership with the local Arab leadership . & nbsp ; When riots broke out a few weeks ago , Lion , who is Sabbath observant , walked on Saturday to meet with community leaders to seek a way to calm the situation , she said . & nbsp ; The city&rsquo;s unity was most clearly apparent , she said , during the COVID-19 pandemic , when everyone banded together to fight a common enemy . & nbsp ; & ldquo;It was beautiful . It was a difficult time , but we came together as a city and that is the measure of how far we have come , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The DNA of Jerusalem is one of diversity , & rdquo ; she said , as she explained that King David chose this space to build this city 3,000 years ago because it did not belong to any one tribe and thus it could be a place where everyone could gather together . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Our DNA is one of convergence , of east and west , of old and new , of past and future and heaven and earth . We will solve all of the conflicts in our country and in our region from Jerusalem , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; THE EXECUTIVE director of the left-wing NGO Ir Amim , Yudith Oppenheimer , said that , factually speaking , Israel annexed east Jerusalem in 1967 and since then it has been managed by one municipality . & nbsp ; On the surface , & ldquo;you can look at Jerusalem and say here is an urban space in which people can move from one place to another , so maybe this is a united city , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer said . & nbsp ; But & ldquo;when you look deeper into the situation , you see that the city is actually divided in many aspects , and each one portrays a picture of two very unequal societies , in which one controls the other , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer added . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;One side has all the resources and is very dedicated to expressing its hegemony , & rdquo ; and the other side lacks those resources , she said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The issue , she said , starts with the fact that most of the city&rsquo;s Palestinian residents lack Israeli citizenship and have only residency rights . Those rights are conditional and can easily be removed , she explained , adding that this insecure status dominates many aspects of their lives , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Everything is conditional . They may not leave the city ; they may lose their residency status . They cannot build in the city , but they have to live in the city , or they lose all their entitlement to the city , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer said . & nbsp ; Palestinians have individual rights in Jerusalem but not collective ones , she said . & nbsp ; Oppenheimer dismissed claims that the Palestinians are to blame for this situation because they refused to take citizenship . & ldquo;This is an urban legend , & rdquo ; she said . Palestinians were never offered collective citizenship , but rather the right to apply individually and that application is very complicated . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;It takes years and many are denied , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Those who do not want citizenship should be offered permanent residency that cannot be easily revoked , so that they can live their lives more securely , she said . & nbsp ; The issue of inequity is the main issue , she said , and that issue is separate from the final political status of Jerusalem , which needs to be negotiated between Israelis and Palestinians , she explained . & nbsp ; & ldquo;So is the city united ? & rdquo ; she asked . It&rsquo;s those who speak so highly of unity that seem to want it the least , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Do they really want for Jerusalem to be united in a meaningful way , in the full meaning of what it means ? Because their actions actually say the opposite , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Her organization , she said , supports a two-state resolution to the conflict in which Jerusalem would be the capital of both an Israeli and a Palestinian state . & nbsp ; & ldquo;But this doesn&rsquo;t mean that the city has to be physically divided , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;It is getting more and more difficult to divide the city . If you ask , the majority of the residents actually enjoy the diversity that the city offers and do not want to see the city divided again . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; There are creative ways to create two capitals without physically dividing the city , and the sustainability of a two-state solution depends on the capacity of Israelis and Palestinians to share the municipal public space in the fullest way possible , Oppenheimer said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; The issue is not about dividing the city but about sharing it , she said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We are actually working very hard not for a vision of divided or united , but for a vision of shared city , & rdquo ; she said . & nbsp ; Abu Diab said it is clear to him that the city is divided . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The food is different , even the dreams are different , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;Here they [ Palestinians ] know they are living under occupation , & rdquo ; said Abu Diab who does not consider himself unified with the Jewish residents of the city . & ldquo;We think they are not living with us and that they want to live without us , & rdquo ; he added . & nbsp ; He has never sought Israeli citizenship , nor does he want it . He dreams of being a citizen of a future Palestinian state in which east Jerusalem will be its capital . But this doesn&rsquo;t mean he imagines that a wall would divide the city , but , rather , that the city would be governed by two different entities , with its citizens walking freely between both . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Jerusalem belongs to everyone . It should be a city of love and peace and nonviolence . It should be an international city , but allow for everyone to be part of their own people , & rdquo ; he explained . & nbsp ; SARA HAETZNI-COHEN , who chairs the right-wing NGO My Israel Movement , said that obviously Jerusalem is Israel&rsquo;s united capital and , as such , all effort must be made to ensure that this is true in practice and not just a slogan . & nbsp ; To make that happen , she said , the issue of inequity between the eastern and western parts of the city must be addressed and it must be the Right that leads that charge . & nbsp ; Failure to do that , she said , gives an erroneous message that Israeli sovereignty in east Jerusalem is temporary . There is little reason to invest in neighborhoods that will one day be given away . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Israel has to make a statement of sovereignty by normalizing its treatment of those neighborhoods , including offering Israeli citizenship to the Palestinians who seek it , she said . & nbsp ; Otherwise , Palestinians have the feeling they are temporary here , Haetzni-Cohen said . & nbsp ; From the start , Israel made a decision to apply sovereignty to the city , and now it should shore up that sovereignty , she said . & nbsp ; To not recognize this reality , she said , is to & ldquo;put one&rsquo;s head in the sand . & rdquo ;","jerusalem day : 54 years later , is the city united or divided ?"

2023-04-24 15:17:52.963,jpost,"Last week saw an interesting discussion around China playing a possible role in peacemaking between Israel and the Palestinians . The discussion illustrates China&rsquo;s growing role in the Middle East.After China helped broker a deal between Saudi Arabia and Iran , it appeared that Beijing could solve many problems by posing as an outsider with no real agendas or baggage.China&rsquo;s foreign minister indicated that Beijing could play a role in Israel-Palestinian peace talks , according to reports last week . He had separate calls with Israel and the Palestinians , The Guardian reported . & ldquo;The separate phone calls between the Chinese foreign minister , Qin Gang , and the Israeli and Palestinian top diplomats comes amid recent moves by Beijing to position itself as a regional mediator , & rdquo ; the report said.According to an article at Al-Ain media in the UAE , for many years , & ldquo;China maintained good relations with the Palestinians and the Israelis , but it did not present itself as a mediator to resolve the conflict between the two parties . & rdquo;China has now played a role bringing Saudi Arabia and Iran together , however , so why not tackle another area of tensions , the report said . & ldquo;Israel considers the United States to be the exclusive mediator in its conflict with the Palestinians , and has always rejected European , UN and Russian mediation , & rdquo ; it said.It appears the Palestinians think the Chinese might play a positive role . This was raised by Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki last week . However , China is now perceived as a rival by the US , and Washington has been clear to Israel and other countries that they should be wary of China&rsquo;s influence , especially as that might relate to sensitive technology.This is at the heart of several controversies over the years , such as China investing in ports or communications . Because Israel has such close ties to the US and Israeli defense companies have many US partners , there is an increased spotlight on China&rsquo;s role in the region . In fact , China&rsquo;s growing influence in Israel appeared to peak a few years ago.China is reaching out to the Palestinians . Beijing says it supports the PA , seeks to continue assisting the Palestinians and backs the two-state solution . The Chinese said they would welcome visits by Palestinian officials.So how would China facilitate peace talks with Israel and the Palestinians?SO HOW would China facilitate peace talks with Israel and the Palestinians ? Considering how China signed a 25-year deal with Iran recently , is it an impartial actor today ? The global shifts that are taking place in the wake of COVID and Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine may have changed things so much that Beijing would find it to be an uphill struggle these days.Nevertheless , China appeared to have message discipline on this issue . It has spoken to Israel and the Palestinians . Chinese President Xi Jinping appears serious . There are several ways this could develop , and China could try to mediate more and play a larger role.This will put Israel in an awkward position . If Israel appears to not be interested , it could cause China to see Israel in a negative light and begin to invest more in ties with the Palestinians and Iran . Tehran has interests here as well . Iran&rsquo;s agenda is to undermine the PA and spread chaos in the Palestinian cities via weapons smuggling.China is officially against militants , terrorists and chaos . Beijing claims to want stability in the region , and it wants deals between parties in conflict so that it can develop trade relations.China has been talking up its Belt and Road Initiative for years . This was supposed to knit the region together in economic terms . However , once again , the Russian war in Ukraine and US-China tensions have changed things . Russia&rsquo;s war accelerates processes in international relations , which means it accelerates China&rsquo;s confrontation with the West.Despite France&rsquo;s outreach , Beijing is indicating it supports Moscow undermining the global rules-based international order . Beijing continues to make comments about the Baltic states that cause dismay in the West.On the other hand , as the Belt and Road Initiative may not be as important these days , because the world is more divided , and China&rsquo;s soft , quiet and consistent approach to influence building in the region has shifted , it&rsquo;s not clear if the economic-stability model is even relevant.For instance , for many years , we were told that linking Russia&rsquo;s economy to Europe would reduce the chances of war . In the end , this globalization neoliberal agenda failed because China and Russia have shown that despite economic links , they have become more nationalist , authoritarian and hostile to the West.Thus , democratic peace or Belt and Road have not come to fruition . Therefore , how will China&rsquo;s talk of brokering peace deals come to fruition?For China , the role of mediator is bolstered by it not having a major historic role in the region . On the other hand , it suffers from declining perceptions of neutrality in the region as it plays a greater role here . That means countries all pour into China their hopes and beliefs of what it might be to the region , and as with all diminishing returns and feedback loops , it will inevitably come up short because you can&rsquo;t be all things to all people.The region has a history of having expectations and then being angry when they aren&rsquo;t met . At the same time , China doesn&rsquo;t have a long historic track record of mediation or solving conflicts . The US , despite its baggage , does have a long role of helping end conflicts . This goes back more than 100 years , when Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo;s administration helped end the Russo-Japanese War.China&rsquo;s track record closer to home at ending conflicts does not bode well for peacemaking in the region . A more powerful China is clearly rising , and it is willing to take risks , such as working with the Saudis and Iranians . That may not mean that what it achieved in those talks can be replicated .",could china serve as broker of israel-palestinian peace ? - analysis

No one should ignore the writing on the wall.Israeli designers who worked for Roberto Cavalli ■ SEVERAL LEADING Israeli fashion designers worked for Roberto Cavalli , the iconic Italian designer who died last week.Among the first was Tamara Yovel Jones , who maintained a close friendship and professional relationship with him until his dying day.Not only that , but in her capacity as head of the fashion design units at Shenkar and Bezalel , she sent some of her more talented students to Milan&nbsp;to be inspired by Cavalli , who had a very positive attitude toward Israel and Israelis & ndash ; particularly Israeli women whom he admired both for their beauty and their strength.In November 2011 , when Motty Reif , who inter alia is a well-known producer of fashion shows , decided to revive Israel Fashion Week but called it Tel Aviv Fashion Week , Cavalli came to inject additional glamour by opening the event with a new collection of his own.The revived Fashion Week , after a very long hiatus , did not have the extravaganza that had been the highlight of openings of Israel Fashion Weeks in the 1970s and 1980s , when the late Lea Gottlieb , the founder of Gottex , and her star model , the late statuesque and sensual Tami Ben Ami , provided opening night viewers with a glittering mix of Las Vegas , Paris , and Milan . Gottlieb had an innate sense of drama , which was reflected both in her designs and in her fashion shows , though she herself wore modest classics.Although there definitely is a sense of glamour in the shows produced by Reif , it is more low-key and geared to commerce more than entertainment . Aside from that , there is very little new in fashion today . Innovation resides more in technology than in style . In fact , perusal of fashion publications of the second half of the 1960s proves that what goes around comes around . The designs are exceedingly similar to those paraded on fashion runways today.When Cavalli came to Tel Aviv in 2011 , Tel Aviv Fashion Week , of which he was the key attraction , was naturally launched at the residence of the Italian ambassador , who at that time was Luigi Mattiolo . Among the guests were Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai , international fashion model and actress Noa Tishby , and fashion designer Gideon Oberson , whose beachwear range was the closest rival to Gottex.In their heyday , Israel Fashion Weeks were the country&rsquo;s best means of image promotion , attracting hundreds of overseas buyers along with writers of leading fashion magazines and newspapers . The designs were eye-catching , and the Israeli models were tall , beautiful , and graceful.One of the reasons that Reif wanted to revive Fashion Week was that , just under a decade earlier , he had completed his term as cultural attach&eacute ; to the Israeli Consulate in Los Angeles , where he was extremely conscious of how Israel was perceived . He wanted to promote the beautiful lifestyle image of Israel rather than the military one . The more tension there was in the Middle East , the more Israel&rsquo;s military image came to the fore.There is no doubt that Cavalli helped Reif to get Tel Aviv Fashion Week off the ground , and for that Israel&rsquo;s fashion industry is deeply in debt to himBatman writers sign letter calling for the return of Bibas family&nbsp ; ■ A FONDNESS for the enduring Batman character , who first appeared in comics in 1939 , had the entire Bibas family of Kibbutz Nir Oz dressed in some semblance of Batman for Purim 2024 . On October 7 , 2023 , they were among the hostages taken by Hamas to Gaza.In late November , Hamas said that 10-month-old Kfir Bibas , his four-year-old brother , Ariel , and their mother , Shiri , had been killed , but provided no proof to the claim.There is video evidence that they were alive when taken to Gaza , and the hope in Israel is that despite the inhuman conditions to which the hostages are subjected , the family is still alive.A petition organized by the David S . Wyman Institute for Holocaust Studies , in Washington , DC , and sent to Sheikh Meshal bin Hamad Al Thani , the ambassador of Qatar , and Motaz Zahran , the ambassador of Egypt , has been signed by more than 50 writers , artists , and editors associated with the iconic Batman character . The petition urges the two envoys to Washington to press for the release of Ariel.The signatories on the letter include many of the most renowned comics creators involved with the Batman franchise . & ldquo;Every hostage is equally important , but naturally Batman writers and artists feel a special connection to this young Bat-fan and his family , & rdquo ; said Dr . Rafael Medoff , historian and director of the institute . & ldquo;These comics creators have spent decades developing a hero who fights for the innocent and stands as a beacon of hope for his community , and we&rsquo;re trying to channel that spirit through this effort . & rdquo;Tweeting the Iranian drone attack on Jerusalem ■ FORMER US ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk tweeted during the Iranian assault on Israel : From what one can see on CNN , Iran&rsquo;s drones and missiles are targeting Jerusalem ! That has almost never happened before , because of the sanctity of the Holy City for Muslims . Maybe Iran doesn&rsquo;t value Al Quds in the same way.It was pointed out to him , in replies , that Jerusalem has been targeted several times , but , as can be expected , on the whole Jewish people agreed with him , and Muslims did not . A tweet from a latter source said that Indyk was once a responsible diplomat , but that now it seems that he wants Eylon Levy&rsquo;s job.Eylon Levy and Douglas Murray ■ A VIDEO in which former government spokesman Levy is seen interviewing Douglas Murray is doing the rounds on social media.Though Levy is fiercely pro-Israel , Murray may be even more so . The two don&rsquo;t agree on everything and argue a lot , but in a fairly civilized manner , which makes the interview more interesting . What they have in common , other than their attitudes to Israel , are their beautifully modulated British accents . Both are Oxford alumni , and both are journalists and authors.Khamenei gives Netanyahu a lifeline&nbsp ; ■ DESPITE ALL the rhetoric and the missile bombardment last Saturday night , one has to wonder whether Iran&rsquo;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei actually wants to keep Benjamin Netanyahu in office , in accordance with the old adage & ldquo;Better the devil you know than the one you don&rsquo;t . & rdquo ; Netanyahu&rsquo;s waning popularity & ndash ; even in right-wing circles & ndash ; suddenly reversed in his favor as his years of warning about the Iranian threat leaped from obsession to reality . This was Bibi&rsquo;s & ldquo;Aha ! I told you so&rdquo ; moment.Though presumably as concerned as anyone else in Israel , he&rsquo;s unlikely to send Khamenei a thank-you note , but there&rsquo;s little doubt that Khamenei gave him a lifeline , though in doing so the ayatollah lost some of his own clout and was widely castigated in the international community.If anything good came out of the Iranian belligerence , it was the digital traffic of the overseas relatives and friends of tens of thousands of Israeli residents , who all wanted to be sure that the recipients of their messages were all right . The widespread concern of people living in different time zones and countries was amazing and heartwarming . It was also a sign that when Israel is in trouble , Diaspora Jews rally to help physically , morally , emotionally , and financially . When we speak of ourselves as brothers and sisters , it may sound trite , but it happens to be true.Kaori Matsutomi and Israel&nbsp ; ■ OF COURSE , it&rsquo;s not just Jews who care . During the time she spent in Israel , Kaori Matsutomi , the wife of Shigeo Matsutomi , who was then Japan&rsquo;s ambassador to Israel , made many friends due to her vivacious personality . She has maintained contact with several of them & ndash ; particularly since October 7 , and again since the Iranian missile blast last weekend.She enjoyed her time in Israel and would like to come back.Meanwhile , Japan&rsquo;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced that Koichi Mizushima , Japan&rsquo;s most recent ambassador to Israel , has been appointed as his country&rsquo;s envoy to South Korea . This will be Mizushima&rsquo;s second stint in Seoul , where he previously served as a minister . His new appointment became effective immediately.Israel-Poland diplomatic exchanges&nbsp ; ■ THOUGH JAPAN is quick to send successors , Poland is still dragging its heels in sending a new ambassador to Israel . Marek Magierowski , who was the last Polish ambassador to serve here , was recalled in August 2021 and sent to Washington . Thirteen months ago , following a diplomatic semi-freeze , Poland announced that it was sending an ambassador.In the spirit of the revival of mutual diplomatic exchanges , Israel did send an ambassador in the person of Yacov Livne , who is currently having a very tough time because some people on Poland&rsquo;s extreme Right are accusing Israel of deliberately murdering Damien Sobol , the Polish victim of an accidental shooting of workers of the World Central Kitchen.Taiwan : Israel's constant friend&nbsp ; ■ NONETHELESS , A lot of the animus leveled at Israel for refusal to call a ceasefire has subsided since Iran attempted to make good on its threats against Israel.Among the constant friends of Israel is Taiwan , whose President Tsai Ing-wen met this week with a cross-party Knesset delegation led by Yesh Atid MK Boaz Toporovsky , who chairs the Israel-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group.Members of the delegation included MKs Boaz Bismuth , Vladimir Beliak , and Matti Sarfatti-Harcavi , who were accompanied to the president&rsquo;s office by Maya Yaron , representative of the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei.Tsai commented that bilateral interactions between Taiwan and Israel have recently been very close . She indicated that in addition to regular dialogues on energy , the environment , and the economy , Taiwan and Israel have signed agreements to strengthen exchanges in education , public health , tourism , and other domains.Tsai added that she looks forward to Taiwan and Israel leveraging their industrial strengths and continuing to deepen their partnership , based on their shared values of freedom and democracy , to jointly build more resilient global supply chains.Tsai also expressed her sincere concern and sympathy following Iran&rsquo;s attack on Israel and condemned the use of violence to undermine global peace and stability.She thanked the delegation for its support of Taiwan and expressed appreciation to Toporovsky for his active promotion of cooperation on youth education and humanitarian aid between Taiwan and Israel , and his consistent support on social media and in op-eds for Taiwan&rsquo;s participation in international forums.Referring to Israel as an important global hub for start-ups , Tsai said that Taiwan&rsquo;s Industrial Technology Research Institute , Asia Silicon Valley Development Agency , and major manufacturers are all eager to explore opportunities to further cooperate with Israel.Toporovsky called Taiwan & ldquo;a beacon of democratic and liberal values&rdquo ; and commended Tsai as & ldquo;a beacon of democratic and liberal leadership . & rdquo;He offered Israel&rsquo;s condolences for the loss of life and injuries after the earthquake in eastern Taiwan , noting that the Taiwanese once again showed the world their resilience and strength.He also spoke of the security situation in the Middle East and of the challenges confronting Israel . In this context he said that Israel will always remember Taiwan&rsquo;s support after the attacks by Hamas on Israel on October 7 , and by Iran last weekend.Australian attachment to the Arava ■ THE AUSTRALIANS are coming . It has been mentioned previously in this column that there has been a steady flow of solidarity visits by individuals and groups from Australia.Australian friendship and support groups have given generously to many and varied institutions and projects in Israel , but the folks from Down Under are particularly attached to the Arava.Among contributors to the development of the Arava are Erwin and Lottie Vidor , whose son Allan came with his wife , Sharon , on a familiarization tour and were warmly welcomed by Meir Zur , head of the Central Arava Regional Council , and Naomi Becker , the CEO of the Central Arava Development Company.The senior Vidors are long-term generous donors to Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund , which is responsible for projects all over Israel , including the Arava.After seeing various projects , the Vidors went to Moshav Hatzeva , where the Vidor Visitors&rsquo ; Center is established as a place where visitors can see a film and other exhibits that will give them an insight into agriculture . The couple also visited Sapir Park with its charming lake , waterfall , sculpture garden , and picnic areas.Also in Israel this month were Tony Ziegler , president of the New South Wales Friends of Magen David Adom , and his wife , Carolyn , who are both ardent , hands-on supporters of MDA . When in Israel , they go out with ambulance drivers to actually see for themselves how emergency treatment can often save lives.And coming up on May 20 is an Israel reunion of alumni of Mount Scopus Memorial College , a pioneer of Jewish day schools in Australia , which this year celebrates its 75th anniversary . There are many Mount Scopus alumni , some of whom were actually pupils in the school&rsquo;s kindergarten when it opened , now living in Israel.Special guests at the reunion in Tel Aviv will be Dave Sharma , a former ambassador to Israel and currently a senator for New South Wales , and Daniel Andrews , a former premier of the State of Victoria.Experts discuss agricultural research and development&nbsp ; ■ LAST WEEK , US and Israeli officials convened at the US National Arboretum for a seminar and dinner reception marking the 45th anniversary of BARD , the US-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund.The seminar featured experts who discussed promising prospects on topics related to numerous aspects of agricultural research and development . These included the use of AI and IoT in various spheres of agriculture , including smart farming , postharvest food loss , water security , agro-energy , and photovoltaics.There was general recognition of the importance of international ties in promoting sustainable solutions for agricultural challenges , and of interdisciplinary cooperation.Michael Herzog , Israel&rsquo;s Ambassador to the US , said : & ldquo;The time has come to recognize agricultural security as an integral component of national security . In the realm of food security , we face many challenges . No one country can confront these challenges alone , and we must pool our scientific resources to find solutions . & ldquo;The long-standing partnership between Israel and the US is a crucial foundation for this mission . & rdquo;Agriculture and Rural Development Minister Avi Dichter agreed , saying : & ldquo;We are working on long-term planning . Our policy is targeting food security . We all know and understand that maintaining and providing food security is a necessity that cannot be neglected . We see our agriculture as one of the pillars that must be safeguarded . & rdquo;BARD Executive Director Prof . Yoram Kapulnik noted : & ldquo;Today , both the US and Israel are facing many similar challenges in agricultural practice . & ldquo;Our vision is to catalyze mission-oriented research and collaborative innovation in agriculture , food , and nutrition , transforming global future food systems with more sustainable approaches . We aim to do so by supporting innovative agricultural research and training the next generation across a broad range of agriculture , food , and nutrition-related topics through our fellowship programs . & ldquo;We are also looking into ways we can accelerate innovation in agriculture by bringing together academic leaders and industry experts . & rdquo;Tel Aviv University celebrates 115th anniversary&nbsp ; ■ TEL AVIV , the Hill of Spring , is celebrating its 115th anniversary . Tel Aviv was founded during Passover in 1909 . In the Jewish calendar , Passover is one of four New Years , and marks the beginning of spring . Also founded in 1909 in Jerusalem was the legendary Gymnasia Rehavia , where former president Reuven Rivlin and former minister Dan Meridor were many years later among the students.Officially opened in April 1925 , the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , which was founded in 1918 by Weizmann and Albert Einstein , will celebrate its centenary next year.Rivlin and Meridor are also alumni of the Hebrew University , where Rivlin&rsquo;s father was a member of the faculty . Coincidentally , Meridor will celebrate his 77th birthday on April 25 , which this year falls during Passover.Also celebrating a milestone anniversary next year is Bar-Ilan University , which was opened in 1955 , after its initiation in 1950 by the president of the Mizrachi movement in the US , Pinkhos Churgin.Tel Aviv University took somewhat longer to develop from an idea to a reality . It was initially promoted in the 1930s by mayor Meir Dizengoff ; and after the establishment of the state , another mayor , Chaim Levanon continued to push for it . Eventually , it was founded in 1956 through the merger of the Tel Aviv School of Law and Economics , the Institute of Natural Sciences , and the Institute of Jewish Studies.Event for singles in their 20s and 30s to be held at the Jerusalem Great Synagogue ■ FOR MANY new immigrants who are single , as well as students and volunteers from Zionist youth groups spending a year or two in Israel , festival times such as Passover and Rosh Hashanah can be very sad and lonely because these are the two festivals in which families get together more than at any other time . A sense of loneliness and nostalgia is particularly bad in the case of young singles who are thinking about what they might be missing out on because they are not back in the old country with family and friends.Aware of this , Steve Eisenberg , a resident of Miami , in conjunction with the Jerusalem Great Synagogue and several organizations , has organized a special event for singles in their 20s and 30s to be held at the Great Synagogue on Saturday evening , April 27 , with music , drinks , and refreshments.Cost is the equivalent of $ 25 . Participation is free for soldiers who can prove that they are currently serving . For reservations , Eisenberg can be contacted on WhatsApp at 917-945-7342.The story of Holocaust survivor Avraham Roet ■ THE ORGANIZERS of the Tel Aviv International Salon are already thinking ahead to Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday May 5 , when a ceremony will be held in English , and Dutch-born Holocaust survivor Avraham Roet , who also fought in the War of Independence , will present his amazing story . He was hidden during the war by a Dutch organization called Rightness of the World . Most of his family , including two sisters , did not survive.In March 1946 , he arrived in what was to become the State of Israel . He was wounded while fighting in the War of Independence , and for many years dedicated his life to the rights of Holocaust survivors , retrieving art looted by the Nazis and getting financial compensation for Holocaust survivors from the Dutch government and financial institutions.The venue for the memorial ceremony is Ichud Shivat Zion at 86 Ben-Yehuda Street in Tel Aviv . ISZ hosts a wide variety of religious , cultural , and social events that attract people from across the Jewish spectrum , from totally secular to ultra-Orthodox . Admission to the ceremony is free of charge.Lior Suchard attempts to win friends for Israel ■ LONG BEFORE the conflicts in which Israel is now embroiled , it had an image problem , and has used many strategies in an effort to overcome negative perceptions and attitudes.Even mentalist Lior Suchard is using his unusual talents to win friends and influence for Israel . In an interview with Riki Rath that was published in Makor Rishon , he told of having risked popularity with this decision to serve Israel&rsquo;s interests , and though he may have succeeded to some extent , he lost 20,000 followers . But this doesn&rsquo;t bother him , he said , because he doesn&rsquo;t want people of that kind listed as followers on his social media accounts.It took him a while to realize that there is no point in arguing with anyone who is anti-Israel , so what he did was to explore various pro-Israel platforms and study the messages to determine what he should deliver on his own social media accounts.Sometimes he feels that he&rsquo;s knocking his head against a brick wall , but there are also success stories.He cited the case of Kim Kardashian&rsquo;s mother who had posted on her Instagram account the desire for peace on all sides . Suchard got in touch with her and , in the most objective manner that he could summon , explained the overall situation to her , resulting in her sending a pro-Israel post.If only it was that easy in more influential quarters.Rewarding female reservists&nbsp ; ■ MOST ISRAELIS appreciate the sacrifices being made by reservists , especially female reservists who are the mothers of young families . Some of these women did not wait to be called up but volunteered and insisted on serving.The Snir Association , which supports many charitable projects , believes that such women are entitled to some form of reward , and in cooperation with hairstylist Ofir Almog gave free hair treatments and styling to female reservists as a gift for the Passover festival.greerfc@gmail.com","grapevine april 17 , 2024 : the next prime minister ?"
2024-05-15 16:36:15.317,jpost,"Since the outbreak of war between Ukraine and Russia on February 24 , 2022 , a staggering 83,198 Olim from Russia have sought refuge in Israel , as reported by the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration . According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics , this influx is part of a broader pattern that has seen approximately 1.3 million Russian speakers settle in Israel , making up 15 % of the nation's population&mdash;a demographic that includes those from other post-Soviet states.However , the transition to Israeli life has not been seamless for many . Struggling with cultural and religious assimilation , these newcomers often experience profound isolation and loneliness . As their adjustment hurdles persist well into their second year , the urgency to address their integration challenges becomes increasingly apparent.For more stories from The Media Line , go to themedialine.org.To gain insights into their situation , The Media Line recently spoke to Rabbi Binyamin Minich , a Russian "" war aliyah "" expert from the Daniel community in Jaffa who frequently interacts with new Israeli citizens from the post-Soviet regions . "" Surely , repatriates from the post-Soviet space encounter difficulties integrating into Israel . Although everyone has ' returned home , ' the immigrant crisis remains . People find it difficult from a financial point of view . First and foremost , everyone wants to eat , not to pray . Then comes the crisis of culture and language , "" admits Rabbi Minich . "" It's impossible to be fully Israeli without being born here . And therefore , the crisis will always exist , "" he adds.The rabbi calls the current weakness in integrating Russian repatriates a failure of the multicultural approach . "" People think that because there is a huge Russian-speaking diaspora here , they can settle without much effort . This is not the case . Despite Israel's liberalism , there are cultural and religious codes here , even among the most secular citizens , "" notes Minich.Challenges Russian immigrants face in IsraelDasha Shkolnikova , a 28-year-old Russian immigrant , speaks about the difficulties many face while integrating into Israeli society . "" A fundamental mistake that many make is closing themselves off . Israel is not the right kind of country for that . You have to go out and socialize ; everything here is designed for you always to be outside . Nobody stays at home , and that's the culture , "" says Shkolnikova . "" Many people from Russia left involuntarily , and in their minds , it's ' I fled . ' They only communicate with Russians , & rdquo ; she adds , & ldquo;and it turns into a real Bat Yam ( an Israeli city popular among Russians ) , almost a ghetto . & rdquo;Journalist Ilya Egorov echoes that experience . "" I literally fled to Israel with just one suitcase because I was on a business trip . Then I somehow managed to get the documents transferred and repatriated . "" & nbsp ; "" I rented some apartment and just closed myself off on the balcony every day , opened Zoom , and communicated with my colleagues and friends who remained in Russia . Honestly , apart from one business trip , I haven't even been to Jerusalem , "" admits Egorov.In addition , many immigrants from the post-Soviet space feel nostalgic for their country of origin . Russians may feel their identity and culture are being threatened . "" There's a huge layer of Russian shops and events here , & rdquo ; says Shkolnikova . & ldquo;You can find basically everything . But many things feel unfamiliar here because it's the East . For example , everyone here is very tactile , and for someone from the post-Soviet space , this is very unusual . "" "" I feel that this life&mdash;as if it's not mine , and mine stayed in Russia , & rdquo ; Egorov adds . & ldquo;I can beat my chest and shout , I'm Jewish , I'm Israeli , but I'm only Israeli because I have a passport . "" At the same time , he wants to learn the language and feel like an Israeli . Egorov admires the Israeli mentality and the resilience of people in the face of difficulties and war . "" Nowadays , I keenly feel antisemitism in the world , and I believe I have the right to say that it directly affects me too , "" he says.Rabbi Minich explains that the Jewish self-awareness of many repatriates changes after moving to Israel , which makes their integration harder . "" Perhaps in the country of origin , they felt like Jews , and no one objected to that , but in Israel , they are reminded that they are not by matrilineal descent , and therefore - ' not truly Jewish , ' "" says Minich.His words are confirmed by Polina Altzitser , a 25-year-old language teacher who was repatriated to Israel from Russia in April 2022 due to the start of the war in Ukraine . "" Although I have Jewish roots , no one in my family supported Jewish traditions at all , unfortunately . We didn't talk about it . I always knew my grandfather was Jewish , but we never emphasized that , "" she explains . "" I see strong discrimination here against those who aren't Jews , according to halacha ( Biblical law in Judaism ) . It greatly upsets and angers me . I don't understand what the problem is . Why , for example , can't you get married without some certificate stating that your mother is Jewish ? I faced this when I started dating my boyfriend , and it's been difficult for me , "" confesses Polina . "" It's a secular but , at the same time , very religious country . When it comes to family , traditions , and everything else , I clearly feel a lack of knowledge because my family is not entirely Jewish , & rdquo ; says Shkolnikova . & nbsp ; & ldquo;You must get used to the traditions and understand them , & rdquo ; she adds thoughtfully . & ldquo;Living in a different world , you cannot cut yourself off from it and continue to live as if you were in Russia . Why are you here if you do so ? "" Rabbi Minich shares that besides being liberal , his community is also multilingual and multipolitical , where not only Jews of matrilineal descent but also children , grandchildren , and spouses of Jews are welcomed . "" I believe less in the concept of Russian-speaking synagogues because , ultimately , I think it's impossible to avoid the side effect of ghettoization . Therefore , my community is completely Israeli ; they speak six different languages , "" Minich shares.Repatriates also emphasize the importance of language . "" I immediately enrolled in ulpan ( Hebrew language school ) ; I just knew it was necessary . Language is the DNA of a people and culture . If you don't have the language , assimilating will be much harder for you , "" says Shkolnikova.Ulpan is a big step but not always a complete solution . "" Ninety percent of my surroundings remain Russian-speaking , & rdquo ; says Alzitser . That's why Hebrew is so difficult for me . The problem is that I still can't fully accept that I need the language . I can't say I've completely abandoned my past and understanding of myself as Russian . & rdquo;Minich believes that despite all the difficulties , those repatriates who stay in Israel will significantly contribute to the development of Israeli society . "" Israel is a complex country , and living here isn't easy . Those who are comfortable in Israel ultimately dedicate themselves to the country and make it better , "" he says . "" Immigration is always challenging . And the least we can do for those who have just arrived is to help them feel at home , "" Minich concludes .",isolated amid independence day : russian immigrants face israeli integration issues
2021-07-29 20:42:04.757,jpost,"The UN Security Council must pressure Israel to halt the pending eviction of 3,000 Palestinians living in east Jerusalem including in&nbsp;Sheikh Jarrah , Ir Amim executive-director Yehudith Oppenheimer urged in a special briefing she delivered to the 15-member body . & nbsp ; & ldquo;It is therefore essential to hold the Israeli government accountable , and to urge it to prevent the large-scale displacement of these communities , & rdquo ; said Oppenheimer , who heads an Israeli left-wing NGO that focuses almost exclusively on issues relating to east Jerusalem . & nbsp ; Oppenheimer spoke to the UNSC virtually from Jerusalem during its monthly meeting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . She briefly outlined issues relating to the 350,000 Palestinians who are residents of the city , but not citizens of the country . & nbsp ; Since 1967 , & ldquo;Israeli authorities have employed a system of discriminatory policies to weaken the Palestinian hold on the city , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer charged . & ldquo;These policies have included : land confiscation , settlement [ Jewish ] building , denial of citizenship and political rights , permanent residency revocation , insufficient service provision&nbsp ; and severe restrictions on planning and building in east Jerusalem . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; But Oppenheimer focused specifically on the fate of four small communities in east Jerusalem , where some 3,000 Palestinians are&nbsp;in danger of losing their homes ; Sheikh Jarrah , Batan al-Hawa , Bustan and Walaja . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I am speaking because these measures of Palestinian displacement have recently increased in scope and scale in an unprecedented manner , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer said . & nbsp ; At issue are four legal battles ; two involve city plans to build two national parks and the others involve landlord-tenant disputes over land ownership and the legality of the homes . & nbsp ; The most high-profile dispute has been the fate of four families in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood , also known as the Shimon HaTzaddik neighborhood . & nbsp ; The four families have appealed to the High Court of Justice to overrule two lower court rulings , which determined that their homes are owned by the Nahalat Shimon Company that wants to develop the largely Palestinian neighborhood for Jewish housing . & nbsp ; The area had been a Jewish one prior to the 1948 War of Independence when the residents fled . In the aftermath of the war , Palestinians who fled sovereign Israel , including west Jerusalem , moved to that area . & nbsp ; Some 28 families were offered homes there in exchange for relinquishing their refugee status . But the land , previously owned by two Jewish companies , was not registered in their names . & nbsp ; The High Court of Justice is expected to hold a hearing on the appeal on Monday . It had initially delayed the hearing to give Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit time to determine if the government wanted to be a party to the case and to render an option . & nbsp ; Mandelblit told the court earlier this month that he saw no reason for the state to intervene , and threw the matter back to the court . & nbsp ; A source told The Jerusalem Post that Prime Minister Naftali Bennett would not order the eviction of the Sheikh Jarrah families . Police have the option to refuse eviction orders that might cause a danger to security . & nbsp ; Hamas has claimed that Sheikh Jarrah is one of the reasons that it launched a salvo of rockets at Jerusalem and other towns in May , which sparked an 11-day Gaza war . & nbsp ; Bennett&rsquo;s opposition to the demolitions is likely to delay the matter , possibly for a long time , but it could not ultimately subvert the legal process should the High Court rule against the families . & nbsp ; It is believed that the fate of the petition by the four families will determine the fate of the remaining 24 families in the neighborhood at risk of losing their homes . & nbsp ; Ambassador to the US and the UN Gilad Erdan attacked Oppenheimer when he addressed the council , charging that she had brought & ldquo;Hamas&rsquo;s lies about Jerusalem to the Security Council . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; It&rsquo;s a move , he said , which & ldquo;strengthens the terrorist organization and weakens the Palestinian Authority , & rdquo ; and that it is an & ldquo;absurd&rdquo ; and & ldquo;dangerous&rdquo ; situation . & nbsp ; Erdan warned that the & ldquo;Hamas narrative&rdquo ; put forward by Oppenheimer could be used to justify terror attacks against Israel . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Today&rsquo;s discussion might serve to increase Hamas&rsquo ; influence in Jerusalem and the Palestinian arena , & rdquo ; Erdan said . & nbsp ; He charged that Ir Amim had a & ldquo;long history of spreading distorted claims regarding Israel&rsquo;s legitimacy and presence in Jerusalem , while ignoring inconvenient facts . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Erdan claimed that more than & ldquo;half of Jerusalem&rsquo;s Arab residents would prefer Israeli citizenship to Palestinian citizenship . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Far from being displaced , Erdan said , & ldquo;Jerusalem&rsquo;s Arab population has increased by over 400 % since Jerusalem was reunited in 1967 . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; An Ir Amim briefing to the council , he said , is & ldquo;as absurd as bringing a leader of the Yellow Vests protests to give an & lsquo;objective&rsquo ; briefing on the French Government&rsquo;s economic policy . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Neither the NGO nor the Security Council can undermine the & ldquo;millennia-old connection between the Jewish People and its eternal capital of Jerusalem . & rdquo ; He added , & ldquo;We will always keep that promise . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Despite & ldquo;false claims to the contrary , we will never accept the delegitimization of our legal , historical and national rights in Jerusalem , by the Security Council or any other international body , & rdquo ; Erdan said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Successive Israeli governments had framed these cases as standard property disputes , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer explained to the UNSC , but that in reality they were & ldquo;systematic campaigns&rdquo ; aimed at changing the demographic makeup of east Jerusalem . This is done by uprooting Palestinian families and supplanting them with Jewish enclaves within larger Palestinian neighborhoods , Oppenheimer said , adding that it&rsquo;s a situation that creates friction and makes normative communal neighborhood life difficult . & nbsp ; The situation is possible because of the discriminatory legal system that allows Jews to reclaim property lost as the result of the 1948 war , but forbids Palestinians from reclaiming property they lost in that war . & nbsp ; The & ldquo;pretexts for many of the demolitions are the absence of building permits , which are nearly impossible to procure due to the absence of proper zoning plans that the Israeli authorities have failed to advance , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Many of the families facing evictions are Palestinian refugees who lost homes in 1948 , and who now stand to be displaced for a second time , & rdquo ; she claimed . & nbsp ; Oppenheimer also highlighted the case of Batan al-Hawa in Silwan , noting that the court had asked Mandelblit to provide a response by August 29 . The request indicates & ldquo;a possible understanding that these cases have far-reaching political and moral ramifications and therefore require&nbsp ; government involvement , & rdquo ; Oppenheimer said , adding that & ldquo;the Israeli government is now being compelled to take an explicit position on these eviction proceedings . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; That is why international pressure is so important at this juncture , she said . & nbsp ;","pressure israel not to evict 3,000 palestinians , ir amim tell unsc"
2021-10-27 22:17:10.883,jpost,"& ldquo;Palestinians renew threat to nix agreements with Israel , & rdquo ; read the headline to a story in Wednesday&rsquo;s Jerusalem Post . According to the story by Khaled Abu Toameh , Palestinian officials are threatening to rescind the Oslo Accords , cut off security cooperation and demand one democratic state & ndash ; instead of a two-state solution & ndash ; if Israel does not recognize an independent Palestinian state with east Jerusalem as its capital along the pre-1967 lines . In addition , the Palestinian leadership has decided to dispatch envoys to several countries urging them to pressure Israel , and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas is planning a visit to Russia to get Moscow to do the same and press Israel into committing to a two-state solution . Maybe , in Moscow , an idea first broached in 2007 , a Russian-sponsored international conference on the Middle East , will be floated yet again . Abu Toameh&rsquo;s story , with a slight change of the names of some of the officials quoted inside , could have been written in 2005 , 2010 and 2015 . It is as if time has stood still , as if the Palestinians have a set diplomatic menu from which they call in an order from time to time . Nothing has changed . Not the threats to scrap Oslo , stop security cooperation with Israel or lobby the world to step up the pressure on the Jewish state . One staple on that menu that was not mentioned this time , at least not yet , was that Abbas would resign , something he has threatened to do & ndash ; but has failed to deliver on & ndash ; numerous times in the past . What is clear from these tired threats , and the same old pattern of actions & ndash ; saying all signed agreements will be canceled , going to Moscow , threatening to revoke recognition of Israel & ndash ; is that the PA has no idea what to do next diplomatically . The diplomatic process has ground to a halt , the Americans & ndash ; realizing that it is not going anywhere right now & ndash ; have pushed it way down their list of priorities , and the PA leadership has no idea of how to further its aims . So it reverts to the default option : threats . THERE ARE two problems with that option , however . The first is that these threats have been issued so often in the past that they simply don&rsquo;t move anybody . They are empty . And the second problem is that using these threats has not worked . The PA leadership has not moved any closer to its goals by threatening to break off agreements with Israel or get an international conference convened . Issuing these threats may serve a domestic political need to flex a muscle from time to time , to show the home audience that the leadership is doing something , but it is having exactly no impact on Israeli policy , and not doing much either in terms of mobilizing international involvement . All these threats do is demonstrate that the Palestinian leadership is out of ideas . Short of complaining that Israel is an apartheid state committing ethnic cleansing and trying to get the International Criminal Court to step in , it has no fresh propositions to put forward . Not , mind you , that the Israeli government is bursting with them . But it is trying to put forth a more constructive approach , though others will argue that the recent announcement about a plan to advance construction of more than 3,000 homes beyond the Green Line is anything but helpful . Even there , however , that announcement was preceded by approval of some 1,300 units for Palestinians in the West Bank , as well as the granting of legal status to some 4,000 Palestinians living there & ndash ; types of & ldquo;constructive gestures&rdquo ; toward the Palestinians not seen in years . This is all part of an idea that has taken hold in the Bennett government of & ldquo;shrinking the conflict , & rdquo ; making life for the Palestinians easier , improving the economic conditions in the West Bank , and promoting economic independence there , even while acknowledging that an overall peace settlement is nowhere in the offing . Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has not taken this idea , developed by Micah Goodman & ndash ; who reportedly has Bennett&rsquo;s ear & ndash ; as far as Goodman would like , but it is still something . Goodman&rsquo;s idea is for more than just an & ldquo;economic peace , & rdquo ; but actually for Israel to give the Palestinians more area to control , a direction that Yair Lapid could conceivably follow if/when he becomes premier in August 2023 . Even if Bennett is not going as far as Goodman might like , he is still pushing something positive . The PA leadership , on the other hand , is just going back to the same slogans and the same methods , vainly hoping that this time they will render a significantly different result . They won&rsquo;t . Some new ideas , new thinking , new approaches are badly needed out of Ramallah . The PA needs to come up with something better than the & ldquo;same old , same old , & rdquo ; because that has proven to be a path leading nowhere .","the palestinian ‘ same old , same old ’ is getting them nowhere - analysis"

2024-03-18 12:02:07.347,jpost,"The government , rabbis , and general public have been at their wits&rsquo ; ends arguing about whether and how to encourage haredi ( ultra-Orthodox ) yeshiva students to join the Israel Defense Forces and/or get an academic education to be able to support their families and strengthen the economy.According to newly published research supported by the Edmond de Rothschild Foundation and published in the journal Learning , Culture , and Social Interaction , 93.8 % of haredi students at the Jerusalem College of Technology ( JCT ) described having a positive experience in volunteer programs.Haredi students&rsquo ; participation in volunteer programs offered by their colleges can make other members of their community more inclined to enroll in higher education , the study reveals.The study , led by Dr . Zvika Orr , Prof . Edith Blit-Cohen , Maya Vardi , Bina Beieri , and Prof . Daphna Golan-Agnon , found that student volunteers from underrepresented minority groups like Israel&rsquo;s ultra-Orthodox sector can bridge the gap between academic institutions and their communities by serving as agents of societal change . & ldquo;This is the first study to explore community engagement programs involving haredi students , and it is our hope that the findings can serve as a template for analyzing students&rsquo ; community engagement among various minority groups worldwide , & rdquo ; said Orr , a senior lecturer in the Selma Jelinek School of Nursing at JCT , who , along with Dr . Adi Finkelstein , is the co-founder and co-director of the college&rsquo;s Lev Bakehila community engagement program.The paper examined responses from questionnaires and in-depth qualitative interviews with students enrolled at JCT , many of whom are first-generation students . A case study on JCT students contained within the report aimed to show how social engagement can impact minority and underrepresented groups navigating the academic world.Student responses were based on several volunteer programs , including Perah , a volunteer framework in which college students serve as tutors to younger children and provide them with academic and emotional assistance ; Lev Bakehila , where students work to promote the rights of people with disabilities affiliated with Jerusalem&rsquo;s haredi community ; and the Payis Scholarships and Impact Program , in which students engage in volunteer work in a variety of fields and organizations , such as schools , community centers , hospitals , and assisted-living facilities.Haredi student volunteers : experience is informative and enriching&ldquo;Through their community engagement , haredi students act as agents of knowledge and change in their communities . Although this process is wrought with challenges and dilemmas , the haredi student volunteers described their experiences as informative and enriching . This case study illuminates how community engagement can help underrepresented students cope with navigating their communities and the academic world , & rdquo ; said Prof . Blit-Cohen of the Paul Baerwald School of Social Work and Social Welfare at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem ( HU ) . Responses from students participating in the study revealed that their community engagement experiences helped them bridge the gap between the haredi and academic worlds . The authors said that community engagement serves as a positive catalyst among the ultra-Orthodox because volunteering coincides with one of the basic religious and cultural values practiced in their community , where the prevailing discourse emphasizes charitable and benevolent endeavors , acts of loving kindness , and compassion.Additionally , community engagement work helped them foster social change within their communities . During their service , they were able to formulate a new perception of social phenomena and offer this newly adopted perspective within their communities . In the interviews , those involved in a disability rights project , for example , mentioned their sense of commitment to changing social perceptions about people with disabilities in their haredi communities and beyond.Along with the many well-documented social and academic benefits associated with community engagement , volunteer service also reflects JCT&rsquo;s institutional commitment not only to excellence on academic and religious levels but also to fulfilling the college&rsquo;s responsibility to make positive contributions to society.The study&rsquo;s authors chose to spotlight haredi students because they are often caught at the crossroads between their community and academia . According to the Central Bureau of Statistics ( CBS ) , in 2020 , only four percent of Israeli students were ultra-Orthodox , less than a third of their share in the college-aged population , and the dropout rate among haredi students is almost three times higher ( 23.9 % ) than the rate among non-haredi Jewish students ( 8.2 % ) . & ldquo;Given our findings , we are calling for more inclusive community engagement programs that reflect and further enhance the diversity in higher education , & rdquo ; Orr concluded . & ldquo;It appears that the key solution for the optimal integration of haredi students in community engagement programs should be understanding the unique needs and cultural sensitivities of this community . & rdquo ;",community engagement motivates ultra-orthodox jewish men to pursue higher education - study

2021-06-09 21:45:42.343,jpost,"Operation Guardian of the Walls was not meant to overthrow Hamas , but to bring about deterrence by severely hitting the capabilities of the terrorist groups in the Gaza Strip , IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Aviv Kohavi said Wednesday . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Operation Guardian of the Walls was not intended to overthrow Hamas in the Gaza Strip but to use such military force that it would deprive Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad of many of their capabilities , & rdquo ; said Kohavi , who was speaking at an event in memory of former IDF chief Amnon Lipkin-Shahak at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya . & nbsp ; And while the groups were struck by extreme force over the course of 11 days , Kohavi warned that & ldquo;we need to be modest about what deterrent effect it will produce . The Six Day War was a sharp and smooth victory ; but shortly after , the War of Attrition began . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Deterrence is & ldquo;an elusive concept subject to the cruel judgment of the time , & rdquo ; he continued , adding that it must be translated into & ldquo;strategic and political achievements , and we have all said & ndash ; the prime minister , defense minister & ndash ; that whatever was will not be , both in our reactions and our attitude toward Hamas . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The mainly air campaign saw hundreds of targets struck by the IDF in response to the over 4,000 rockets fired by the terrorist groups . Hundreds of the targets hit had been found , marked and hit in real-time , including missile launchers that were aimed at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem . & nbsp ; & ldquo;During three days of Operation Guardian of the Walls , the Southern Command and the Gaza Division destroyed 70 multibarreled launchers . They destroyed a multibarreled launcher every hour , & rdquo ; the chief of staff said , adding that thanks to techniques and capabilities developed during the fighting , & ldquo;we were able to bring a new connection between the sensors and intelligence&rdquo ; and expose the multibarreled launchers . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We then set out to attack one after the other , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; Other targets destroyed included rocket launchers , rocket manufacturing , production and storage sites , military intelligence offices , drones , residences of commanders , and Hamas&rsquo;s naval commando unit , where Israel has destroyed most of the group&rsquo;s infrastructure and weaponry , including several autonomous GPS-guided submarines that can carry 30 kilograms of explosives . & nbsp ; The majority of attacks that the groups tried to carry out against Israel were also stopped and the majority of the rockets fired towards Israel were intercepted . & nbsp ; Hamas , Kohavi said , did not succeed in the way they wanted . & nbsp ; During the fighting & ldquo;we attacked three times more every day , and with high-quality and accurate targeting , than in previous operations . This shows the capabilities of the IDF that we will continue to develop , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp ; But the capabilities of the IDF are not cheap , he said , and neither are the munitions and other weapons that the military needs . & nbsp ; & ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do what I said without money . Without a fixed and regulated budget . All over the world , the concept of an army is that it is going to be more expensive . An anti-tank missile is more expensive than 30 years ago , for many reasons . Tanks are more expensive , F-35s are more expensive . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; And the Iron Dome , which the military says intercepted 90 % of rockets fired towards residential areas , is not cheap either . But , Kohavi said , the cost of the Iron Dome is worth it because it saves significantly more amount of money in damages should the rockets fall in those areas . & nbsp ;",idf chief kohavi : be modest with how long gaza deterrence will last
2022-07-27 18:06:30.783,jpost,"After countless operations in the Gaza Strip where the army failed at legitimizing its actions , the IDF has published several military sites used by Hamas in the heart of urban areas.The sites , including a weapons warehouse next to Shifa Hospital as well as several mosques , will likely be targeted in a future conflict between the two sides.The IDF has been highly criticized during military operations in the densely populated Gaza Strip , both abroad and in Israel . During last year&rsquo;s 11-day Operation Guardian of the Walls , the military was condemned for a strike that targeted the 12-story al-Jalaa tower in Gaza City , which housed AP&rsquo;s offices , among others.During last year&rsquo;s conflict , Israel also targeted what they described as Hamas&rsquo;s & ldquo;Metro&rdquo ; network of underground tunnels . The strikes on the underground network , 60 km . long , caused some homes to collapse , killing close to 60 people , including children.Though the operation destroyed what the IDF considered was a Hamas & ldquo;backbone&rdquo ; & ndash ; where its commanders could move troops and weapons and direct attacks against Israel & ndash ; the military was criticized for the civilian deaths.An assessment by Airwars , which tracks all civilian harm by all foreign actors in Syria and other conflicts , found that between 56-68 civilians were killed during the strikes targeting the & ldquo;Metro , & rdquo ; with at least 25 children having been killed . Another 168 civilians were injured.IDF investigates PR issuesFollowing the May conflict , the IDF opened an investigation into public relations-related issues connected to the conflict and began to work on better coordinating its public advocacy efforts with its actions during war . & nbsp;While it&rsquo;s a complex effort , the military believes that legitimizing its actions even before war would provide it with more freedom of action when conflict breaks out . Defense officials said that while the military does not see another war breaking out , preparations for another round of conflict in the Strip are conducted regularly.On Wednesday shared with both foreign and local press several sites used by the terror group that are military targets.Among the sites disclosed to journalists on Wednesday was a tunnel used to store weapons and and move fighters in Gaza City's Tuffah neighborhood next to a now-closed Pepsi factory that closed following last year&rsquo;s war as well as close to a UNRWA&nbsp;elementary school which is used as an emergency shelter for some 2,500 people in times of hostilities.Another tunnel used by Hamas in the Zabara neighborhood of Gaza City identified by the IDF on Wednesday is under a UNWRA school and a central ambulance center with 14 ambulances as well as a medical equipment storage complex . The tunnel also runs under a church and schools that are used as shelters during hostilities.Another site is a tunnel entry shaft that was exposed during last year&rsquo;s conflict near the al-Azar university in Gaza City which has about 20,000 students . According to the IDF , the tunnel entry shaft leads to a network of subterranean tunnels that branches throughout the Tel-Hawa area southwest of Gaza City and is also close to a police station , a UNWRA school , medical clinic , mosque , a community center and UNRWA&rsquo;s headquarters in the area.According to the IDF , Hamas has a munition production facility located in a building that is also used as a residential building . The site , which contains explosives and flammable material that would cause extreme damage should it explode , is 45 meters from a mosque , 55 meters from a UNRWA clinic that is used as a triage and primary screening center , and 60 meters from Shifa hospital.Shifa is considered the blockaded enclave&rsquo;s main hospital and treats thousands of patients daily . But it has also been used by the terror group for years , including in the 2009 Operation Cast Lead , when senior Hamas officials hid in the building . It also used the hospital in 2014 during Operation Protective Edge as its main headquarters.The IDF also shared the location of a munition warehouse used by Hamas inside the al-Shahid Mosque in the Bureij refugee camp , in the heart of a civilian neighborhood and next to a public library funded by Germany&rsquo;s KfW bank . The mosque serves as a community center , providing first aid courses and activities for local children.Another mosque identified by the IDF as an ammunition depot was the Abdullah Azzam Mosque in the Nuseirat refugee camp . According to the army , the mosque is an important part of the camp , is surrounded by residential homes and is just 86 m . from the offices of UNRWA&rsquo;s North Nuseirat relief and social services . & ldquo;An explosion , an accident or even a fire in the warehouse could result in injuries to civilians , from worshipers in the mosque to people who come to receive humanitarian aid , & rdquo ; the IDF said.Following a Wednesday tour of the Gaza Division , Defense Minister Benny Gantz said , & ldquo;Hamas fires from within the civilian population and into the civilian population & ndash ; the world should charge Hamas a price for its crimes . & rdquo;Gantz : world must be aware of Hamas ' crimesFollowing a Wednesday tour of the Gaza Division , Defense Minister Benny Gantz said , "" Hamas fires from within the civilian population and into the civilian population - the world should charge Hamas a price for its crimes . & rdquo;Gantz was accompanied by Deputy Defense Minister Alon Shuster , General of the Southern Command Maj . - Gen . Eliezer Toledano , Head of the Operations Directorate Maj . - Gen . Oded Basiuk and Head of the Gaza Division Brig . - Gen . Nimrod Aloni.Gantz said the Defense Ministry has been & ldquo;working extensively&rdquo ; to create a sense of security for residents of the South , as well as work toward allowing the residents of Gaza to have a better economy while continuing to disrupt Hamas&rsquo;s attempts to strengthen itself militarily . & ldquo;Today , the IDF revealed to the world examples of the depth of Hamas&rsquo;s use of the civilian population , which it chooses to put in the front line of fire , & rdquo ; Gantz said . & ldquo;The whole world should be exposed to the crimes committed by Hamas , and exact a heavy price for that . & rdquo ;",idf unveils hamas sites to be targeted in future gaza conflicts

We weren&rsquo;t able to control the ball the way we wanted to , but I&rsquo;m very happy with the win . Sometimes you have to work very hard to win . & ldquo;This is another game that gives Reineh more and more credit , & rdquo ; Sharon Mimer said . & ldquo;I can say that I am very proud of my team and my players , even more than some of the games that we did win . We gave Maccabi some gifts and that gave them confidence , but we have shown time and time again that we won&rsquo;t break . & rdquo;Meanwhile , by the Carmel Mountain , Maccabi Haifa defeated Hapoel Haifa 2-0 as Dean David scored a second-half brace to hand the Greens the derby points and the win to stay in the title race.After a goalless first half , Frantzdy Pierrot sent David a through-ball that he put past the Carmel Reds & rsquo;keeper Yoav Gerafi in the 72nd minute to break the deadlock . Two minutes later , David found the back of the goal from 16 meters out to sew up the victory . & ldquo;Hapoel Haifa is a very good defensive club , & rdquo ; Maccabi Haifa head coach Messay Dego began . & ldquo;We had to figure out when it was best to press them . & nbsp;I was a bit upset as to how we played in the first half , but we took some chances in the second half . The dream is still alive and if we still have a chance to win the title we will do our utmost . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We had a very weak day and we couldn&rsquo;t control the ball at all , & rdquo ; Hapoel Haifa coach Roni Levy said . Unfortunately that didn&rsquo;t help our cause . When we play an open style of game that doesn&rsquo;t play to our advantage and every loss , especially a derby , is a bitter defeat for us and the fans . & rdquo;Beitar Jerusalem crushes Hapoel Tel AvivAt Bloomfield Stadium , Beitar Jerusalem crushed Hapoel Tel Aviv 5-1 to cruise to the big win and take the three points.Ori Dahan struck first as he opened the scoring for the yellow-and-black in the fourth minute while 45 minutes later Mayron George doubled the advantage for a 2-0 lead . Yarden Shua added the third marker just five minutes later while Ismaila Toro gave Beitar a 4-0 lead by the 79th minute.Mavis Tchibota pulled back a goal for Hapoel Tel Aviv by penalty , but Nehoray Dabush put in the visitors&rsquo ; fifth goal of the match to polish off the four-goal victory . & ldquo;Terrific , no question about it , & rdquo ; a content Beitar head coach Barak Itzhaki said . & ldquo;To come in here and win this way it feels great . We took a 1-0 first half lead and we weren&rsquo;t that great but we put on quite a performance in the second half . The guys are just champs . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Really rough feelings , & rdquo ; Hapoel Tel Aviv head coach Yossi Abukasis said . & ldquo;To lose such an important game the way we did after the first half & ndash ; which was perhaps one of our best & ndash ; and then fall apart in the second half is very disappointing and painful . We will have to figure out a way to deal with this . & rdquo;Elsewhere , Hapoel Beersheba got by Bnei Sakhnin 2-1 as the Southern Reds came back from a deficit to take the victory.Following a goalless opening half , Basil Khuri scored off a counter attack in the 57th minute , but a Dor Hugi own-goal three minutes later evened up the score . However , Constantinos Soteriou picked up a red card , resulting in a Helder Lopes penalty that he calmly slotted home to give Beersheba the slim win . & ldquo;This was a crazy game , & rdquo ; Beersheba beach boss Eliyaniv Barda said . & ldquo;The game began to our advantage and we had chances , but we couldn&rsquo;t score . The guys worked very hard and we are the best home team in the league . We want to play our best and collect as many points as we can over the course of the next month . & rdquo ; & ldquo;We were leading 1-0 and we tried to pressure Beersheba , & rdquo ; Sakhnin coach Slobodan Drapic said . & ldquo;Not every club will go and do that . We made mistakes and lost the game . We are trying to get more and more of our young players time to play and from there we will see what we have for next season . & rdquo;Also , Hapoel Jerusalem downed Hapoel Hadera 2-1 thanks to a pair of quick second-half goals to take all the points.Ido Levy opened the scoring for visiting Hadera as he headed home Samy Bourard&rsquo;s cross to give Haim Silvas&rsquo;s squad a 1-0 lead , but five minutes into the second half Ohad Almagor drew the hosts even . Just two minutes later Dia Lababidi redirected a Cedric Don ball for an own-goal which was the eventual winner for Ziv Arie&rsquo;s team . & ldquo;The small changes we made in personnel specifically for Hadera&rsquo;s system worked out well , & rdquo ; Jerusalem&rsquo;s Arie said . However , most important was how the players reacted positively . I thought that once we took the lead we would be able to have a bit more control but we ended up with a couple of injuries . & rdquo ; & ldquo;After we took the lead , Jerusalem took some chances and I&rsquo;m disappointed that we couldn&rsquo;t take advantage of them , & rdquo ; Hadera coach Haim Silvas said . & nbsp ; & ldquo;This was a wide open game and I knew they would take some risks in the second half as they went forward , but I felt we would be able to score a second goal with the weapons that we have . & rdquo ; Maccabi Netanya blanked Maccabi Petah Tikva 2-0 as the diamond city side scored a goal in each half to take the victory.Netanya grabbed a 1-0 lead after Joel Abu Hana&rsquo;s ball went off of Obeadia Khattab and into his own net in the 16th minute , while Igor Zlatanovic doubled the advantage in the second half to snatch the three points . & ldquo;We deserved the win , & rdquo ; Netanya coach Marko Balbul exclaimed . & ldquo;The result should have been even more than it was but I am very content . We were able to calm down after the State Cup loss which was pretty painful for all of us.But the guys with mentally and physically put on quite the show in terms of the game they played and the result . & rdquo ; & ldquo;This was not a good game from us in terms of pressure and energy , & rdquo ; Petah Tikva assistant coach Ben Binyamin said . & ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t come into this game properly and we have to see why that was the case . We were weak in the middle and we didn&rsquo;t do what we needed to do in this game . & rdquo;Finally , Ashdod SC slipped by Hapoel Petah Tikva 1-0 as Ezekiel Henty scored the lone goal of the game at the stroke of halftime to give the port city squad the conquest .",yellow-and-blue edges closer to clinching title
2024-06-20 19:25:46.950,jpost,"A 5 % across-the-board budget cut for government ministries was the main proposal in a series of budget cuts laid out at a Finance Ministry meeting on the 2025 budget held Wednesday , Globes said sources from the ministry told them.Other proposed cuts included pay cuts for senior managers in the public sector , postponed raises in the civil service , abolishing unnecessary ministries , and a NIS 2 to 4 billion cut in funds allocated to coalition parties - all amounting to NIS 3.5 billion , according to Globes.While the total amount of cuts that the ministry makes in order to reduce Israel's deficit is critical to the country's economic recovery ; given Israel's political and social climate , the composition of the cuts that are made is also critical.Unequal treatmentFlat budget cuts across the board for all ministries will likely have significant repercussions for all parts of Israel's society , which could cause widespread frustration if the public does not think that serious cuts to coalition funds , and funds for unnecessary ministries that prop the coalition up are being prioritized over cuts that hurt the entire public.The recent controversy over the "" rabbis bill "" and the haredi draft law have highlighted deep discontentment in Israel's society when it comes to the treatment of different sectors of society differently and the equal sharing of national burdens.The rabbis bill aims to give the government control over appointments of municipal and neighborhood rabbis , instead of the current system where the cities appoint their rabbis.As pointed out in The Jerusalem Post's editorial on Wednesday , this bill is widely viewed as an attempt by the coalition&rsquo;s haredi parties to appoint its members to positions and gain influence over issues of religion and state.Highlighting the sense that this bill is seens as a coalition jobs-grab , Yesh Atid MK Yaron Levi summed up the inequality many felt this bill strengthened . & ldquo;If the prime minister can approve 1,000 new rabbis , and not 1,000 psychologists , then this place is a piece of trash , "" he said.Public protest of the unequal sharing of the security burden has also been coming to a head recently as the haredi draft law is advanced with no real solution in sight.The IDF says that they need more manpower , the ultra-Orthodox leadership has not made concessions that would allow for a bill that satisfies this need , and the public fury over this inequality grows with every day that the law is not amended and that more IDF soldiers are killed in the Israel-Hamas war and in Israel's northern conflict with Hezbollah.The 2025 budget may become just another instance of the government's failing balancing act between coalition pressures and demands by the public to meet the needs of the majority of Israelis.This wouldn't be entirely new . The current government has already been criticized for how sectoral its allocation of funds has been and for failing to address this and cut coalition funds when the war necessitated a rethinking of the 2024 budget . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We found in this budget , that to a much larger extent than in previous coalition agreements , coalition resources were very sectoral , & rdquo ; former Bank of Israel Governor Karnit Flug told The Jerusalem Post last month . & ldquo;The fact that they didn&rsquo;t cut coalition expenditures [ after the outbreak of the war ] that are very sectoral and are not based on professional work substantially undermines the trust in the government . This will make it much harder to come to the public and say & lsquo;look , there is an additional burden that you will have to incur , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; explained Flug.The Israel-Hamas war has brought the issue of the unequal burden on Israel's different sectors , long kicked down the road , to a head . Given this and the precarious situation of the coalition , Israel's budget could potentially be the next crisis that could topple it , or bring the widespread public protest to new boiling points.Public trust in the government has been stretched and challenged possibly beyond repair since the outbreak of the war , and also in the year prior during the advancement of the judicial overhaul.The budget is another opportunity for the government to try to show the public it is prioritizing the needs of the many ; or for it to show that coalition demands are the top of its list of priorities . & nbsp ;",is the 2025 budget israel's next social powder keg ? - analysis

He accused Abbas of walking away from the Palestinian national consensus and violating the resolutions of Palestinian institutions that called for severing ties with Israel . & ldquo;This meeting comes within the framework of consolidating the security and economic solution by offering more economic bribes in return for preserving the security of the settlers and the occupation , & rdquo ; Awadallah said . The Mujahideen movement in the Gaza Strip said the PA leadership was wasting its time by betting on the option of negotiations and the good intentions of Israel and the US . & ldquo;The path of comprehensive resistance is the only way to restore the rights of the Palestinian people , & rdquo ; it said in a statement . & ldquo;The meetings with the Zionist leaders encourage the Zionist entity to continue with its policy of aggression against our people . & rdquo ; Al-Ahrar , a Gaza-based group of Hamas-backed Fatah dissidents , said the Abbas-Gantz meeting was a continuation of the security cooperation between the PA and Israel . & ldquo;This is a stab [ in the back ] to the Palestinian people , their revolution and their resistance , & rdquo ; it said in a statement . & ldquo;Such treacherous meetings are not related to political work . This is a new betrayal of national resolutions and the will of the Palestinian people . & rdquo ; Ghassan Jadallah , a senior member of the Democratic Reform Current headed by ousted Fatah leader Muhammad Dahlan , also criticized the meeting between Abbas and Gantz . Dahlan , who is based in the United Arab Emirates , is an archrival of Abbas . The meeting came at a time when Abbas was setting conditions for meeting with his political rivals , Jadallah said . & ldquo;It could take months to arrange a meeting between one Palestinian official and the other , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;But it takes one phone call to hold a meeting with the minister of war of the enemy . & rdquo ; Referring to Abbas , Jadallah asked : & ldquo;What political culture is this that some are trying to inculcate in our behavior , when he [ Abbas ] places a thousand conditions to meet his Palestinian brothers , while he does not even dare to protest against the crimes of his enemy ? When will all this immorality and all this arrogance end ? & rdquo ;",‘ abbas stabbed palestinians in the back by meeting with gantz ’
2023-11-08 18:37:08.830,jpost,"A school in Nablus run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) posted a video to its official Facebook page in which a young student called for the victory of Hamas&rsquo;s & ldquo;Jihad warriors&rdquo ; in Gaza and evoked Mohammad&rsquo;s defeat of the Jews at Khaybar , per a new report from the Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education ( IMPACT-se ) . In the video , several dozen assembled students call out "" Amen "" after each line recited by the boy , who is flanked by what appears to be an UNRWA school administrator . It also shows students reading a passage from a fifth-grade Islamic Education textbook that incites violence and Jihad against Israel , per the report.The report also documented several examples of teachers at UNRWA schools in Gaza praising the attacks on social media , and found ties between Hamas terrorists and UNRWA schools.At least 14 teachers had taken to social media to praise the massacre , both while the atrocities were still ongoing and weeks later.Sarah Alderawy , an UNRWA teacher in Gaza , took to Facebook on October 7 to post a video of Hamas terrorists shooting at Israeli cars that day . The video was captioned with a verse from the Quran that read "" We will surely come to them with soldiers that they will be powerless to encounter , and we will surely expel them in humiliation , and they will be debased . "" UNRWA teacher Ebrahim Al Azaia posted a video on Facebook of a rocket landing in a parking lot in Israel . He included the caption "" What a splendid sight ! "" Afab Talab , a teacher at an UNRWA school in Gaza , posted on the day of the attacks that they represented the "" first real victory "" on the way to liberating all of Palestine , along with a video montage of the infiltrations , the kidnapping of an Israeli soldier , and Israelis at a party fleeing for their lives.The report also found that more than 100 Hamas terrorists were confirmed to have graduated from UNRWA schools , and stated that is statistically likely that the majority of the 3,000 terrorists who perpetrated the October 7 massacre attended UNRWA institutions , which make up half of all schools in Gaza . In one terrorist&rsquo;s car , a diploma from an UNRWA-run school was found . & nbsp;UNRWA , which has received nearly $ 1 billion from the US over the past 5 years , and similar amounts from the UK , EU , and others , uses textbooks written by the Palestinian Authority , which have been found to consistently promote Jihad , antisemitism , and suicide attacks against Israelis . The report gave several more examples of this from 2023 textbooks , including excerpts from math and science lessons . In one example , a fourth-grade math problem reads : & ldquo;The number of martyrs of the First Intifada ( the Intifada of Rocks ) is 1,392 martyrs , and the number of martyrs of the Al-Aqsa Intifada is 4,673 . The number of martyrs in the two intifadas is _________ martyrs . & rdquo;Another demonstrates Newton&rsquo;s Second Law of Physics by displaying an animation of a Palestinian aiming a slingshot at approaching Israeli soldiers , and asks students to identify the forces that affect the projectile after its release from the slingshot and spring . First-graders are taught as part of a grammatical exercise that "" Jihad is one of the gates to paradise . & rdquo;A chapter discussing the role of women in combat in Islam glorifies a woman who fatally stabbed a Jew as "" justly an example of a brave Muslim woman in defense of the Muslims . "" Most graphically , an eighth-grade Arabic textbook contains a story for reading comprehension glorifying suicide attacks against Israeli soldiers . The story praises Palestinian fighters in the battle of Karameh , describing how they "" wore explosive belts , thus turning their bodies into fire burning the Zionist tank . "" An illustration is shown depicting a Palestinian spraying bullets at Israeli soldiers in a tank . The story then describes how the soldiers ' bodies and body parts became "" food for wild animals on land and birds of prey in the sky . "" UNRWA's history of using educational materials that glorify terrorismGlorification of terrorism in textbooks used by UNRWA has been reported on for several years . UNRWA's policy is to use textbooks that are provided by local educational authorities , despite this not being listed as a requirement in the UN's mandate to the organization . An UNRWA official told The Jerusalem Post in 2020 that the organization&rsquo;s protocol was to review all educational materials given to its teachers by local educational authorities , but rather than to censor or refuse to use them , to instruct its teachers to simply skip over potentially inciting material.UNRWA&rsquo;s chief spokeswoman told Foreign Policy Magazine in 2021 that & ldquo;there is zero tolerance&rdquo ; in UNRWA schools for & ldquo;incitement , antisemitism , and discrimination . & rdquo;However , UNRWA has itself directly published material containing the glorification of terrorism and antisemitism . An IMPACT-Se report from 2021 found that UNRWA had sent its schools self-study materials for students to use at home during the coronavirus pandemic , which "" egregiously violated "" UN , UNESCO , and UNRWA's stated values and standards . The material , which contained the official UNRWA symbol , contained antisemitic material as well as calls for "" martyrdom , violence , and Jihad , "" per the report.UNRWA subsequently acknowledged that it had "" mistakenly "" published inappropriate material for student use , and stated that the issue had been dealt with and that future instances would be prevented through a rigorous review process . However , a July 2022 report by IMPACT-se found that self-published material from UNRWA continued to encourage "" jihad , violence , and martyrdom , "" as well as "" antisemitism , conflict discourse , hate , andintolerance . "" Former US president Donald Trump cut off all American funding for UNRWA in 2018 , drawing outcry from Palestinian rights advocates . President Joe Biden restored the US&rsquo;s relationship with the organization in 2021 , with the US having sent nearly $ 750 million to the organization over the past three years .",unrwa school celebrates hamas's ' jihad warriors ' in gaza - report

2021-12-28 17:00:11.610,jpost,"Israel&rsquo;s continued war-between-wars campaign has led to a decrease in Iran smuggling weapons into Syria , according to IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Aviv Kohavi . & ldquo;The increase in the scope of operations over the past year has led to a significant disruption of all smuggling routes into various arenas by our enemies , & rdquo ; he told reporters on Sunday , ahead of New Year&rsquo;s Day . Israel has repeatedly warned about Iran&rsquo;s nuclear ambitions as well as aspirations of regional hegemony . It has admitted to hundreds of airstrikes as part of its & ldquo;war-between-wars&rdquo ; ( known as MABAM in Hebrew ) campaign to prevent the transfer of advanced weapons to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the entrenchment of its forces in Syria , where they could easily act against Israel . In an attempt to halt Iran&rsquo;s hostile regional activity , Israel has increased its operations in Syria . The firing of antiaircraft missiles by regime forces has also increased . The military believes Iran , Syria and Hezbollah are deterred from war with Israel , as they rarely retaliate against Israeli strikes . When they do , they tend to target US bases . The latest alleged Israeli strike on Tuesday morning targeted Latakia Port and destroyed an immeasurable amount of advanced and strategic weaponry . However , the strikes have not been limited to Syria . Iran&rsquo;s air , land and sea corridors did not function for 70 % of 2021 due to operations carried out as part of the MABAM . Kohavi said last year that the increase in operations , both overt and clandestine , had led to a slowdown of Iran&rsquo;s entrenchment in Syria . & ldquo;But we still have a long way to go to complete our goals in this arena , & rdquo ; he said . With the risk of regional war breaking out being low , and as Israel&rsquo;s campaign against Iran in Syria is achieving satisfactory results , the MABAM will continue into the coming year , senior military officers have said . During a visit to the Ramat David Air Force Base along with IAF Commander Maj . - Gen . Amikam Norkin and OC Strategy and Third Circle Division Maj . - Gen . Tal Kalman , Defense Minister Benny Gantz called on the countries in the region to stop Iran from harming their sovereignty . The IDF had a year with & ldquo;significant operational action , & rdquo ; Gantz said , adding that the military has dealt with threats on various fronts , & ldquo;all of which are fueled by Iran , which is the greatest enemy to the citizens of Israel and the people of the Middle East . & ldquo;The Iranian regime cannot provide education or water to its citizens , but it continues to invest huge sums in its nuclear project and its proxies . Iran is undermining governance in Syria , Lebanon , Yemen and other countries , and it seeks to set the region on fire . I call on the countries of the region to stop Iran from harming its sovereignty and residents . & rdquo ; Israel will not allow Iran to send balance-breaking weapons to its proxies to threaten Israeli citizens , he said . & ldquo;The IDF will continue to operate everywhere & ndash ; in the air , on land and at sea & ndash ; to ensure the security of the State of Israel , & rdquo ; Gantz said . In addition to Israel&rsquo;s policy of removing Iran from Syria , the regime of President Bashar Assad has been working with the Russians in an attempt to expel all foreign forces from Syria . After Assad regained control of 60 % of the country , the government has been trying to reassert itself as sovereign and expel Iran and its proxies , including Hezbollah and other Shi&rsquo;ite militias . As Assad works with Russia , Israel will continue to take advantage of the situation to push Iran out . While Israel&rsquo;s strongest ally remains the United States , the IDF continues to work with Russia , a key influencer in the Middle East and especially in Syria , where it has leverage over Assad . In addition to continuing the MABAM , the IDF is advancing plans for a military strike against Iran , to be prepared if or when the political echelon decides to carry out that strike against Tehran&rsquo;s nuclear program . During a speech at the Institute for National Security Studies conference in Tel Aviv last year , Kohavi said he had ordered the military to begin preparing renewed plans for a strike on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program . & ldquo;Iran can decide that it wants to advance to a bomb , either covertly or in a provocative way , & rdquo ; Kohavi said . & ldquo;In light of this basic analysis , I have ordered the IDF to prepare a number of operational plans in addition to the existing ones . We are studying these plans , and we will develop them over the next year . The government , of course , will be the one to decide if they should be used . But these plans must be on the table , in existence and trained for . & rdquo ; With tensions increasing over Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program and regional hostility , both Israel and Iran have been threatening each other . Senior officers have said the military is capable of carrying out a strike . On Friday , at the end of five days of military drills , Iran fired 16 ballistic missiles toward a target simulating Israel&rsquo;s nuclear facility in Dimona . The IDF knows that should a strike be ordered , the response would be a multifront war with Hamas , Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies , firing thousands of rockets , including precision missiles , toward Israel and its strategic assets . To prepare for such a scenario , the IDF has increased its intelligence-gathering capabilities for future operations , procuring additional weaponry , updating operational plans for all fronts , increased training exercises over the past year , and updated its target banks . Although the amount of precision weapons it has is 10 times the number it had on the eve of the Second Lebanon War , the IDF is continuing to procure a large amount of precision and special munitions . The NIS 58 billion defense budget set for the IDF in the coming year is expected to allow the military to focus on the threats posed by Iran across the region , with NIS 3.5b . designated for this . Intelligence and operational cooperation , along with joint exercises with foreign and regional countries , are also helping Israel&rsquo;s security and are of great significance , the military believes . A year after the signing of the Abraham Accords , which led to the normalization of relations with several Arab countries , the potential for cooperation and the building of significant military manpower is already evident . The main threats to the country remain the rocket arsenals of Hamas and Hezbollah , Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program , and potential nuclear weapon and infiltration forces such as Hezbollah&rsquo;s Radwan Unit . As tensions with Lebanon and Syria remained high , 31 rockets were fired from Lebanon and another two long-range rockets were fired from Syria . In response to the rockets fired from Lebanon ( by Palestinians and Hezbollah ) , the IDF fired munitions from fighter planes and some 200 artillery shells . The military also thwarted nine attempts to infiltrate from Lebanon and another two from Syria . It also confiscated 120 kilograms of drugs and 75 weapons over the past year . Despite the ongoing tensions , the IDF views the overall strategic-security situation as having improved compared with previous years .",kohavi : increase in syria ops has led to decrease in iran weapons smuggling
2021-06-03 19:16:04.230,jpost,"The Palestinians do not believe that an Israeli government headed by Yamina head Naftali Bennett will advance the peace process with Israel because of his far-right political positions , but his hi-tech background as a software entrepreneur could open opportunities for economic cooperation between the two sides , a Palestinian official said on Thursday . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The man has proven that he is more right-wing than [ Prime Minister Benjamin ] Netanyahu , & rdquo ; the official said referring to Bennett . & ldquo;Therefore , we do not expect someone who supports annexation and settlement expansion to make any progress on the political track . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Asked if he thought there was hope for boosting economic ties between the Palestinians and Israel under a Bennett government , the official replied : & ldquo;Absolutely . It seems the man has been very successful in his business career and has adopted a liberal approach on economic issues . We are ready to work with any Israeli leader who will help us strengthen our economy . But Bennett and other Israelis need to understand that the Palestinian issue is not just about the economy or improving the living conditions of people . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; A Palestinian businessman from Ramallah said that the Palestinians would & ldquo;welcome&rdquo ; any plans for boosting the Palestinian economy , & ldquo;even if they come from someone like Bennett , who is an extremist when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . As a politician , Bennett is bad for the Palestinians . But if he wants to work with us on economic issues , we say ahlan wa sahlan ( welcome ) . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Palestinian Authority officials refused to publicly comment on the political drama in Israel and the prospects of Bennett heading the new government . & nbsp ; In private , however , some said they would be & ldquo;more than happy&rdquo ; to see an end to the Netanyahu era . & nbsp ; The officials said that the PA was ready to deal with any Israeli government that believes in the two-state solution and the implementation of all United Nations resolutions pertaining to the Israeli-Arab conflict . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The Palestinian Authority is closely following the political developments in Israel , & rdquo ; said one official . & ldquo;We are confident that the departure of Netanyahu and his extremist right-wing government will be good not only for the Palestinians , but for the Israelis as well . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Another Palestinian official said that the chances of reviving the stalled peace negotiations with Israel would be much higher once Netanyahu is out of office . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We are currently working with the Biden administration , the European Union , Egypt and Jordan to resume the political process&rdquo ; with Israel , the official said . & ldquo;There is hope that these efforts will be successful under a new Israeli government . There is no real difference between Bennett and Netanyahu , but some elements of the new coalition are committed to the peace process . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Palestinian political analysts , meanwhile , said that they did not expect & ldquo;real changes&rdquo ; toward the Palestinian issue under a Bennett-led government . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Bennett is dreaming of annexing parts of the West Bank and he is opposed to a Palestinian state , & rdquo ; said political analyst Eyad al-Ahmed . & ldquo;Those who think that the new government in Israel will change Israeli policies toward the Palestinians are deluding themselves . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Ahmed said he and other analysts do not share the view that Bennett could promote economic cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians . & ldquo;You can&rsquo;t promote economic cooperation when you hold hostile views toward the Palestinians , & rdquo ; he remarked . & nbsp ; Sufian Abu Zaida , a senior official with the ruling Fatah faction and former PA prisoners affairs minister , said that the new government will avoid making decisions related to the conflict with the Palestinians and instead & ldquo;focus on fixing what Netanyahu destroyed internally . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Hamas officials said that the Palestinians are not banking on any government in Israel . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Our Palestinian people do not count on any Israeli government , & rdquo ; said Hamas official Ezzat al-Risheq . & ldquo;We only rely on our resistance and unity to extract our rights . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said that his group does not differentiate between Israeli politicians . & nbsp ; & ldquo;They are all the product of a Zionist project , & rdquo ; Barhoum said . & ldquo;The new government will not change the nature of the conflict with the occupier . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Meanwhile , several Palestinians and Arabs denounced Mansour Abbas , head of the Ra&rsquo;am ( United Arab List ) Party , for signing an agreement to support the new coalition . & nbsp ; Arabs from the Gulf states described Abbas as the & ldquo;head of the Muslim Brotherhood in Israel , & rdquo ; and accused him of hypocrisy for supporting the new coalition . Palestinians described the agreement Abbas reached with the coalition as & ldquo;shameful . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;In the Israeli political circus , there is a clown named Mansour Abbas , & rdquo ; commented Palestinian political analyst Yousef Zaatreh . & ldquo;He leads a group called the Islamic Movement .

2023-02-03 12:25:15.547,jpost,"Since the signing of the Oslo Accords , the peace treaty between Israel and Jordan , and the Wye River Agreement in the 1990s , efforts by politicians and diplomats to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have stalled . In the 21st century , according to Rabbi Ron Kronish , religious extremism , ultranationalist fanaticism , and intransigent leadership on both sides , fueled by competing narratives about the past and the present , meant & ldquo;a war process replaced the peace process . & rdquo;According to Kronish , after then-opposition leader and Maj . - Gen . ( res . ) Ariel Sharon made a provocative visit to the Temple Mount , Palestinians launched a Second Intifada ; the Israeli government constructed what it called a & ldquo;security fence , & rdquo ; which Palestinians blasted as an & ldquo;apartheid wall&rdquo ; ; and , in 2005 prime minister Sharon ordered what turned out to be a disastrous withdrawal of Jewish settlers and the IDF from the Gaza Strip.These developments , Kronish states in his book Profiles in Peace , have made peacebuilders & ldquo;the only game in town . & rdquo ; The initiatives of the non-governmental organizations they established , he believes , provide the last best hope to influence decision-makers to reverse course and make compromises to ensure a just and lasting resolution to what is now regarded as an intractable conflict.Can NGOs help decision-makers make peace?Born in the US and educated at Brandeis University and Harvard&rsquo;s Graduate School of Education , Kronish immigrated to Israel in 1979 , four months after Israel and Egypt signed a peace agreement . In 1982 , Kronish took to the streets , joining protests declaring the Israeli army complicit in the massacre of Palestinians in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla in Beirut . & nbsp;From 1991-2014 , he served as the founder and director of the Interreligious Coordinating Council in Israel ( ICCI ) . A harsh critic of what he calls the & ldquo;militaristic , anti-Palestinian , pro-occupation&rdquo ; Likud Party , as well as PLO and Hamas terrorists , Kronish is the author of The Other Peace Process ( 2017 ) . In Profiles in Peace , Kronish reviews efforts by politicians to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since the 1967 Six Day War and provides biographical sketches of six peacebuilders & ndash ; three Israelis and three Palestinian Arabs & ndash ; and four members of a younger generation of activists . & nbsp;Despite & ldquo;overwhelming obstacles and complex challenges , & rdquo ; Kronish claims , these men and women have demonstrated that & ldquo;enriching and energizing&rdquo ; relationships with perceived enemies can be forged , laying the foundation for a common future for Jews , Christians and Arabs.Peacebuilders operate on the assumption that dialogue on subjects of mutual interest , undertaken in supportive settings , enhanced by precepts of trauma healing and conflict resolution , can empower individuals to bridge religious and ethnic differences . Hands of Peace , for example , brings Israeli and Palestinian teenagers to the US for four successive summers . In 2018 , the Alliance for Middle East Peace created a Storyteller&rsquo;s Project to enlist peacebuilding alumni , including Israeli and Palestinian soldiers , to share their experiences.Again and again ( Profiles in Peace , alas , is often repetitious ) , Kronish singles out initiatives to & ldquo;get to know & lsquo;the other&rsquo ; deeply , & rdquo ; and take seriously his or her religious and historical narratives , as central to peace work.Who are the activists?KRONISH&rsquo;S ACTIVISTS & ndash ; Huda Abuarquob , Mohammed Dajani Daoudi , Munib Younan , Michael Melchior , Galia Golan , and Hadassah Froman & ndash ; have certainly exhibited an abundance of courage , conviction , commitment , perseverance and resilience.It&rsquo;s less clear , however , how effective their efforts have been . Kronish does not address studies revealing that contact does not increase religious or ethnic toleration in & ldquo;weak relationships . & rdquo ; And that self-selection is a significant ( and therefore limiting ) factor in forging enduring relationships with perceived enemies.As Kronish and his peacebuilders acknowledge , moreover , the political context between Israel and the Palestinians has made free and unfettered interreligious and intercultural dialogue difficult to arrange . When Dajani , a professor of American studies and librarian at Al-Quds University , proposed taking 30 Palestinian students to Auschwitz and 30 students to a refugee camp in Bethlehem , a violent response to the trip led to his resignation and the cancellation of the project . & nbsp;And neither Israeli nor Palestinian authorities accepted the recommendation of Bishop Younan&rsquo;s Council of Religious Institutions of the Holy Land to revise textbooks in the schools.Most important , during the last two decades , peacebuilders&rsquo ; initiatives have not had a significant impact on Israeli or Palestinian politicians , or for that matter , on public opinion.And so , it should not be surprising that , along with frequent expressions of hope , Kronish&rsquo;s peacebuilders sometimes give voice to pessimism about the future . Given & ldquo;the many forces of violence and opposition to what we are doing , & rdquo ; Froman declares her intention , somehow , to & ldquo;create a small oasis of peaceful coexistence&rdquo ; in her area of the West Bank . & nbsp;Convinced that & ldquo;civil strife may one day lead to the end of Israel , regardless of the occupation , & rdquo ; Golan finds it & ldquo;very difficult to be optimistic these days . & rdquo ; Although dialogue has broadened his horizons , Tareq Saman , one of Kronish&rsquo;s younger peacebuilders , has concluded that & ldquo;there is no solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict&hellip ; It looks like one party will win and the other will lose . & rdquo;Responding in his prison notebooks to the rise of fascism in the 1930s , Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci indicated he was & ldquo;far from feeling beaten . It seems to me that&hellip ; a man out to be deeply convinced that the source of his own moral force is himself&hellip ; never falls into those vulgar , banal moods , pessimism and optimism . My own state of mind synthesizes these two feelings and transcends them ; my mind is pessimistic , but my will is optimistic&hellip ; I imagine the worst that could happen in order to summon up my reasons and willpower to overcome every obstacle . & rdquo;In all likelihood , Kronish does not endorse Gramsci&rsquo;s pessimism of the intellect & ndash ; even if the considerable obstacles in Israel , the West Bank and Gaza make it seem reasonable to do so .  The writer is the Thomas and Dorothy Litwin Professor of American Studies at Cornell University.PROFILES IN PEACEBy Ron KronishL.E.A.R.H.N .

Netanyahu&rsquo;s media team knows how to put him in the limelight when they want to : they use video statements , pictures , written statements , and often a mix of all of the above . In this case , a written statement from the Likud party , not the prime minister himself , shows that the prime minister intends to keep himself as far away as possible from the report&rsquo;s conclusions.The content of the response follows this theme . It begins , & ldquo;The Meron disaster was tragic , our hearts are with the families of the victims . In practice , the government has already implemented the required conclusions , and the last event at Meron was held with a large crowd and without fault . The government will examine the need to implement additional operational lessons to prevent a repetition of a disaster such as this . & rdquo;The statement then moves on to accusations : & ldquo;However , it is unfortunate that for the first time in history , the government led by Bennett and Lapid formed a committee of investigation against its predecessor in the political Right , and in which a central member was a confidante of Lapid , Shlomo Yanai , who received an offer for a spot in the Yesh Atid Knesset list . This is a completely distinct political provocation . Lapid&rsquo;s cynical and intentional attempt to turn the Meron disaster into a political tool will not succeed . & rdquo;This response was criticized by members of nearly all of the political parties , including the Likud itself , as well as by a forum that represents the families of the victims , who called it & ldquo;disgraceful . & rdquo;It is worth noting that members of the National Commission of Inquiry were chosen by then-chief justice Esther Hayut , not by the Lapid-Bennett government . The Netanyahu government at the time of the disaster dragged its feet in forming the committee , and at first attempted to form a governmental or parliamentary committee , which would give it some power over the identity of the committee members , as well as reduce the impact of its conclusions.Furthermore , the Likud&rsquo;s response did not mention that Yanai is a retired IDF Major General , a recipient of the IDF&rsquo;s Medal of Distinguished Service , a former CEO of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries , and , according to Haaretz reporter Yossi Melman , was Netanyahu&rsquo;s choice to head the Mossad in 2010 ( which Yanai turned down ) . Nor did the response mention the other distinguished members of the commission & ndash ; former Supreme Court President Miriam Naor , who was replaced by Tel Aviv District Court president Devorah Berliner , and Rabbi Mordechai Karelitz , former mayor of Bnei Brak.Instead of at least acknowledging the fact that Netanyahu was found to bear personal responsibility for the disaster , the response attempts to discredit the members of the committee . Other than saying that the government will examine whether there are any more lessons to implement , the response does not address any of the sweeping systemic failures that the committee found led to the disaster & ndash ; nor the fact that these failures were exacerbated during the decade before the disaster , during which Netanyahu was prime minister.Likud responds similarly to October 7The response is indicative of how the Likud has responded to the October 7 massacre . At least on two occasions , the Likud put out immediate responses to reported intelligence failures leading up to the massacre , in which it said that Netanyahu was not aware of the intelligence and that he was not forewarned by IDF officials.The prime minister has promised that there will be a committee of investigation , but it is not clear when such a committee will be formed . In addition , since the October 7 massacre , he mentioned the word & ldquo;responsibility&rdquo ; in just one press conference & ndash ; and said that he was & ldquo;responsible for the future of the State of Israel , & rdquo ; which implied that he was not responsible for events in the past.The government was slammed with responsibility for the failures of October 7 , and at first , the word & ldquo;responsibility&rdquo ; was uttered by no one ; slowly , that changed . IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi said it first , followed by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich . Netanyahu still has not.A direct line links the Likud&rsquo;s response to the Meron report and its statements since the October 7 massacre : Netanyahu is not responsible , and whoever claims so has political motives . This is likely to continue , and it is thus not clear how and when those who bear responsibility for the events of October 7 will be held accountable . & nbsp ;",likud's response to the meron report is indicative of what's to come - analysis
2024-05-30 01:27:48.777,jpost,"As international actors debate the legitimacy of Israel&rsquo;s operation in Gaza , the war on Israel&rsquo;s northern front rages on . Deaths from the Israel-Hezbollah conflict are continuing to rise , and over 100,000 Israelis are still evacuated from their homes in northern Israel , leading some to question the efficacy of the UN peacekeeper force meant to maintain security in southern Lebanon.After the Israeli army finished a military operation against the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) in Lebanon in 1978 , the UN established a temporary peacekeeping force known as the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) . The body was meant to restore international peace and security and to assist Lebanon&rsquo;s government and army in restoring control of the border with Israel.Israel&rsquo;s 1978 invasion pushed the PLO north of the Litani River , about 18 miles from the border , in order to limit attacks against Israel . Despite the establishment of UNIFIL as a peacekeeper force , Israel returned to Lebanon in 1982 . In 2006 , another conflict broke out between Israel and Hezbollah , a Lebanese Shiite group with ties to Iran.After 34 days of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006 , the UN brokered a cease-fire . Under the agreement , UN Security Council Resolution 1701 , Israel and Hezbollah agreed to cease hostilities , and UNIFIL was tasked with ensuring that no armed groups other than itself and the Lebanese army operated south of the Litani River.Today , UNIFIL comprises more than 10,000 soldiers from 49 nations . In addition to monitoring the border , the organization also provides humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by the exchange of fire in southern Lebanon.UNIFIL's role pre-October 7&ldquo;Before Oct . 7 , we were able to guarantee the overall stability of the southern border for years , and this was clearly a success , & rdquo ; Andrea Tenenti , spokesperson for the UNIFIL mission , told The Media Line . & ldquo;We played an active role . In fact , we have helped the Lebanese army , starting from 2008 , to regain control of the southern part of the country . & rdquo;Despite UNIFIL&rsquo;s successes , Hezbollah has grown stronger in southern Lebanon since 2006 , especially in the towns and villages along the 75-mile-long demarcation line , leading some to criticize UNIFIL as ineffective . Since Oct . 7 , as constant clashes between Hezbollah and Israel have plagued southern Lebanon and northern Israel , those criticisms have grown louder . & ldquo;The UNIFIL mission started with very weak points and ended up being more a cease-fire resolution than a peacekeeping one , & rdquo ; Hanin Ghaddar , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute , told The Media Line . She noted that the forces mostly report violations . & ldquo;They do not possess the tools and permission from the UN to confiscate weapons or even arrest those affiliated with&rdquo ; Hezbollah , she said.Tenenti characterized UNIFIL as & ldquo;the only ones who can mediate properly&rdquo ; amid the rising tensions , noting that the group had arranged meetings between the Israeli and Lebanese armies.UNIFIL does not only monitor the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel&mdash;at times , it finds itself caught up in that contact . & nbsp;Among other incidents , a car bomb killed six UNIFIL personnel in 2007 , and in October , two mortar shells of undetermined origin hit a UNIFIL base , injuring one peacekeeper . & ldquo;Hezbollah targets UNIFIL because they do not want another actor in the south , & rdquo ; Ghaddar explained . & ldquo;It is never an accident when UNIFIL personnel is targeted because the militant group aims to send a message both to the countries that serve in these forces and to the UN : do not interfere with our activities in the southern part of the country . & rdquo;Avraham Levine , a speaker at the northern Israel-based Alma Research and Education Center , told The Media Line that Hezbollah has more control over UNIFIL than UNIFIL does over Hezbollah . & ldquo;There are areas where UNIFIL personnel cannot go to , and if they end up by mistake in Hezbollah&rsquo;s territory , they are attacked on the spot , their vehicles are burnt , and sometimes they are even shot down , & rdquo ; he said.Levine also said that Hezbollah uses UNIFIL bases for its military purposes . & ldquo;Both in 2006 and in further operations that Israel carried against Hezbollah , the militants used UNIFIL compounds as shields for their operations in order to stop Israel&rsquo;s counterattacks against a UN base , & rdquo ; he said.One of the rockets launched at Israel by Hezbollah in December originated just 20 yards from a UNIFIL compound.Levine said that the Lebanese army&rsquo;s lack of action to rein in Hezbollah relates to the Shia sympathies of many of the soldiers as well as the interest in avoiding another Lebanese civil war.Describing both UNIFIL and the Lebanese army as ineffective deterrents to Hezbollah , he said that Israel may have to invade Lebanon once again . & ldquo;We cannot risk another Oct . 7 in the northern part of Israel since [ Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan ] Nasrallah publicly claimed his goal to invade the Galilee . Even if this scenario is not pleasant for both sides , we may need to stop Hezbollah by entering Lebanon as we did in the past , & rdquo ; he said.In the event that a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah does break out , UNIFIL may be a target , Levine said . & ldquo;Maybe this may push to reconsider its mission in the first place , & rdquo ; he speculated .",international peacekeepers day : unifil's role questioned amid israel-hezbollah conflict

2021-01-06 22:15:45.593,jpost,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised to allocate an additional NIS 14 million to advance work on a project & ndash ; dubbed & ldquo;sovereignty&rdquo ; or & ldquo;apartheid&rdquo ; road & ndash ; that would link the E1 section of the Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim settlement with Jerusalem . & ldquo;This is a significant breakthrough in advancing the issue , & rdquo ; Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim Mayor Benny Kashriel said in a statement on the matter posted on the city&rsquo;s website . The project , also called the & ldquo;Fabric of Life&rdquo ; road , is considered essential for the development of E1 , where Israel is slated to build 3,412 homes in a move that would vastly expand Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim , which is the third-largest settler city in the West Bank , after Modi&rsquo;in Illit and Betar Illit . The E1 project has been largely frozen for close to three decades because Palestinians and the international community consider it harmful to the feasibility of a contiguous future Palestinian state . The US , excluding the Trump administration , had also historically objected to the project . Israel has argued that the issue of contiguity is best addressed by an efficient but separate road system , including this one , that would allow direct Palestinian traffic between Ramallah and Bethlehem that skirts the E1 blocs , while Israeli travel between Jerusalem and Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim would also be made easier . Critics of the project have accused Israel of & ldquo;apartheid&rdquo ; for its promotion of a road that separates Israeli and Palestinian traffic . The municipal notice about the project stated that there would be & ldquo;a separate road for Palestinians in the E1 area , & rdquo ; which would distinguish between Israeli and Palestinian traffic so that & ldquo;Palestinian vehicles could pass without traveling through the Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim bloc , near the Jewish settlements . & rdquo ; It noted that & ldquo;at the political level , the road would connect Jerusalem and Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim and allow Jewish settlement construction in the E1 area . & rdquo ; The municipality added that it would ease traffic congestion and eliminate the need for checkpoints . The road would then exit from Eizariya-Abu Dis to the tunnel under the a-Zaim checkpoint , and vehicles would travel on a separate road toward Hizma-Ramallah , the municipality said . Yamina party head Naftali Bennett had initially promoted the project in March when he served as the defense minister . Kashriel said he had campaigned and pushed Netanyahu to allocate more funding , a move that bore fruit only this week , with a conversation between Kashriel , Netanyahu , Transportation Minister Miri Regev and Finance Minister Israel Katz , both of the Likud Party . Prior to the meeting Kashriel sent Netanyahu a letter in which he accused him of dragging his feet on the issue , noting that he had promised to pave the road three years ago at a Likud faction meeting in the Knesset . Then it was determined that the road would be paved in 2020 . Again in August , a pledge was once more given with respect to the road , and yet , Kashriel noted in his letter , he was still seeking funds for the project . After receiving another pledge from Netanyahu for funds this week , Kashriel thanked the prime minister , along with Regev and Katz , for the help . The left-wing group Peace Now charged on Wednesday that the project was part of Netanyahu&rsquo;s reelection campaign . & ldquo;Netanyahu&rsquo;s election campaign is costing Israel a very heavy price . Once again , he is using the election period to try to impress key Likud supporters by promoting a plan that could eliminate the possibility of a two-state solution . The planned road will allow Israel to cut the West Bank in two , build E1 and the separation barrier , and close the door on the possibility of developing a sustainable Palestinian state . & rdquo ; In the last year , Netanyahu allowed for plans for 3,412 settler homes in E1 to be deposited . Peace Now has filed an objection to those plans .",‘ sovereignty road ’ linking jerusalem to e1 to receive nis 14m . boost

They bonded over forming centrist political parties and have discussed ways to promote centrist politics . They are in regular contact over the WhatsApp messaging application.Macron grinned when Lapid arrived at the Elysee Palace in a Renault hatchback , and they embraced , walking into the presidential building with their arms around each other . The French president was effusive in his praise of the new Israeli prime minister . & ldquo;You chose France as your first visit abroad , something I found very moving , dear Yair , & rdquo ; Macron said . & ldquo;The people of Israel are lucky to have you as their new prime minister . & rdquo ; & ldquo;It&rsquo;s a true pleasure for my first visit as prime minister to be to a country and president that is a close friend , & rdquo ; Lapid said.Following his meeting with Macron , Lapid was asked whether he would meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas . Lapid said he would not & ldquo;have a meeting for the sake of a meeting . I would only do it if there was a chance of a positive result for Israel , so it is not at the agenda for the moment . & rdquo;Lapid said , however , he would not rule out such a meeting.The Palestinian issue came up in the meeting with Macron , but it was only a small part of the conversation , a source in Lapid&rsquo;s entourage said .

2023-01-25 11:56:42.110,jpost,"The Border Police on Wednesday shot and killed a masked Palestinian in Shuafat , who had aimed a realistic-looking dummy gun at them , as he fled.A video showing some of the chaos surrounding police and IDF forces preparing to demolish the house of terrorist Udai Tamimi in Shuafat , shows several moments in the back and forth between the sides.At one point in the video , the now-deceased Palestinian is seen aiming his "" gun "" at Israeli forces and then lowering it when a large car passes by in between the sides.Then at another point , the Palestinian is seen again aiming his "" gun "" at Israeli forces.While one cannot see the actions of the Israeli forces in the video , at a certain point , the Palestinian turns around and starts running away.After a few seconds of running , he also tosses away the "" gun . "" A few seconds later in the video , he falls down dead.Police say they didn't know the gun was fakeFrom the limited vantage point of the video , it is possible that : 1 ) he was shot at only after he dropped the dummy gun and fled ; 2 ) while holding the gun he aimed at police but then managed to toss the gun and run another 30-40 feet before collapsing ; or that 3 ) the police started shooting at him while he held the gun but may have only hit him after he was fleeing . The police said he was hit while still aiming the gun at them.The police reported that they discovered the & ldquo;gun&rdquo ; was a dummy weapon only after the fact . At the same time , it was unclear whether the killing was justified . If he was hit before he was fleeing it was certainly justified . If he was hit after he dropped the "" weapon "" and fled , it gets hairier.Rules of engagement in such situations do provide for firing at the legs of such a person who has presented a threat in order to prevent their escape and arrest them.An initial response response from the police did not address the issue of the Palestinian dropping his weapon and fleeing , but did highlight that he had shown all of the open signs of presenting a threat . & nbsp;The IDF declined to comment , saying that even though there were soldiers in the area , the incident had been managed by the border police . & nbsp;The police would have been in charge given that the incident was taking place in east Jerusalem as opposed to the West Bank , where the IDF has primacy.Tamimi was killed in mid-October when he was shot dead in a failed shooting attack at the entrance to Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim , south of the Israeli capital.He arrived at the entrance to the West Bank city and opened fire at nearby security personnel . According to United Hatzalah volunteer EMT Akiva Skolnick , the terrorist was killed by returning fire from the guards . A grenade and knife were found on his person . "" Two highly experienced security guards that were at the checkpoint at the city entrance neutralized the terrorist immediately , with bravery and a lot of resourcefulness and without fear . "" The shooter was responsible for the killing of 18-year-old Military Police officer Noa Lazar on October 8 when he opened fire at a checkpoint near the Jerusalem neighborhood of Shuafat . A 30-year-old security guard remains in intensive care , sedated and on a ventilator . A third person , a soldier , was also injured . & nbsp ;",border police kill palestinian who aimed dummy gun at them as he fled
2024-06-03 08:46:01.000,jpost,"That old joke was wrong . The book of Jewish sporting achievements is in fact quite thick . . . and fascinating . & ldquo;In many ways , the development of Jewish sports reflects the realities of Jewish life over the past 120 years , & rdquo ; says Osnat Zur , director of the Iris Smith World Jewish Sports Museum in Ramat Gan&rsquo;s Kfar Hamaccabiah campus.The innovative 21st-century museum , inaugurated during the 22nd Maccabiah in 2022 , depicts an under-recounted aspect of the development of Jewish identity and Zionism . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The museum in essence tells not only the story of Jewish sports but of the Jews in general in the 20th century , & rdquo ; says Zur . & ldquo;We embark on a journey through time , see how the nationalist movements arose around the world , how the first Maccabiah offered a vision , through the disaster of the Holocaust & ndash ; from which it took decades for Jewish sports to recover & ndash ; the Munich massacre , and on to October 7 . & rdquo;A visit to the interactive display , suitable for children and adults alike , puts Jewish sporting achievements in perspective . The 1,500 square-meter museum , designed by Israeli company Breeze Creative , presents the history and heritage of Jewish sports through more than 1,000 rare items , videos , and exhibits . & nbsp;The museum&rsquo;s timeline begins in 1890 with the establishment of the first Jewish sports club in Constantinople , Turkey , built around a fencing team . Then Max Nordau&rsquo;s famous & ldquo;muscular Jew&rdquo ; speech at the second Zionist Conference in Basel , Switzerland , in 1898 sparked the birth of dozens of Jewish sports clubs throughout Europe , and Jewish sports flourished in the early part of the 20th century . & nbsp;In terms of achievements , the best was Hakoah Vienna , champions of the Austrian national soccer league in 1924-25 and runners-up in 1921-22 . The soccer club&rsquo;s parent association was the largest sporting organization in the world in its time , numbering more than 5,000 members and offering a wide variety of sporting activities . & nbsp;Jewish sports & ndash ; notably fencing and boxing & ndash ; prospered in Europe until Nazism reared its evil head . The museum&rsquo;s displays chart the rise in antisemitism in Europe , with Jewish athletes and teams gradually banned from competing . The chronological section devoted to 1933-39 is titled & ldquo;From Champions to Victims . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Hitler viewed the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games as a propaganda tool & ndash ; and the world agreed to his terms , as one of the video displays explains ( in your chosen language ) . Signs at entrances to the Olympic stadium pronounced & ldquo;No entry for dogs and Jews . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Then-world champion swimmer Judith Deutch refused to represent Austria , made aliyah instead , and passed away in 2004 after a meaningful life in Israel . It should be noted , however , that other Jews competed in the Olympic Games , and were forced to salute Hitler . & nbsp;Hakoah Vienna could not survive the Anschluss of March 11-13 , 1938 , when Nazi Germany annexed neighboring Austria , and the club disbanded in 1941 , only to reestablish itself after World War II on a modest scale.Meanwhile , as more Jewish immigrants poured into pre-state Israel , the local sporting unions Maccabi , Hapoel , and Beitar burgeoned , each with its own political affiliations and patrons . & nbsp;The Maccabiah is really one man&rsquo;s idea . Yosef Yekutieli & ndash ; who later went on to establish the Israel Football Association and Israel Olympic Committee & ndash ; had the then-maverick vision of holding a & ldquo;Jewish Olympics&rdquo ; in 1932 , and advertised the event by riding his motorcycle throughout Europe . Some 470 competitors turned up for the inaugural Games in Tel Aviv that year . For the second Maccabiah in 1935 , some 1,200 athletes competed in a specially erected stadium and swimming pool . Then came the war.The third Maccabiah in 1952 was a small , sad event that became known as the & ldquo;revival Maccabiah&rdquo ; & ndash ; an axiom to be repeated in the 2025 event . Since then , the quadrennial Games have increasingly attracted Jewish ( and some non-Jewish ) athletes by the thousands , earning the moniker & ldquo;the second-largest sporting event in the world&rdquo ; ( in terms of number of athletes competing ) after the Olympics . The Maccabiah is an event with a meaning beyond sports . Among the dignitaries attending the last opening ceremony was US President Joe Biden.Documenting the pastThe need for a museum documenting the rise , fall , and rise again of Jewish sports has become more evident as more Jewish athletes have made their mark on the world stage . & nbsp;Admittedly , Jews may not have left their mark the way they have , say , on the Nobel Prize , but the list of Jewish sports legends & ndash ; from the 18th-century father of scientific boxing Daniel Mendoza , through baseball legend Sandy Koufax to multiple gold medalist swimmer Mark Spitz & ndash ; is richer than generally perceived . & ldquo;There had been more talk about establishing the museum over the past decade , & rdquo ; says Zur . & ldquo;Then came a generous donation from Iris Smith that allowed the project to go ahead . & rdquo;Orit Engelberg-Baram was chosen as content curator , a committee of leading sportspeople and sports historians assembled . . . then the pandemic broke out , and everything stopped . & ldquo;Ultimately , this actually worked for our good , & rdquo ; says Zur . & ldquo;Maccabi&rsquo;s outside activities came to a halt , suddenly freeing up time and resources for this project in a new building under construction on the site of the old museum . & rdquo ; ( The site at Kfar Maccabiah was previously home to a charming , if somewhat aging , corner called The Pierre Gildesgame Maccabi Sports Museum , established in 1982 , with an archive and exhibits concerning Judaism , Zionism , and Sports . ) & nbsp;The museum employs English - , Spanish - , and Hebrew-speaking guides . Over 40,000 visitors have passed through so far , mainly Israeli school and pensioner groups and Jewish groups such as Taglit-Birthright and Masa , but also & ndash ; somewhat surprisingly & ndash ; many individual non-Jewish tourists . & ldquo;They want to understand the essence of this country , and sports is part of that , & rdquo ; explains Zur , a former Young Maccabi emissary in the US who is now director of the Maccabiah's Education Department&nbsp ; & ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy to be a Jewish sportsperson nowadays , & rdquo ; she notes . & ldquo;Jewish athletes worldwide are increasingly afraid to identify with Israel . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Even more so their non-Jewish colleagues , at a time when being pro-Palestinian is considered cool . & nbsp;Within days of October 7 , the Maccabi World Union launched its Sportspeakup project , recruiting over 150 leading athletes from around the world & ndash ; including 15 non-Jewish former NBA basketball players & ndash ; who recorded social media messages calling for the release of Israeli hostages . & nbsp;But it wasn&rsquo;t easy . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Even though it&rsquo;s a humanitarian issue not a political one , many of the sportspeople we approached said they were scared to participate . They didn&rsquo;t want to deal with antisemitic cries from supporters at their games , & rdquo ; explains Zur . & nbsp;Victory of sports over evilAs Israeli society slowly recovers from the trauma , the museum&rsquo;s first planned temporary exhibition in July will concentrate on October 7 and sports . & ldquo;Many sportspeople died that day , & rdquo ; Zur sighs . & ldquo;There were some heart-wrenching stories , a mixed reaction from the sports world to the event , and more antisemitism in sports . & rdquo;The exhibition will recount the story of Israeli sports through the mirror of October 7 , focusing on the sporting victories in this most difficult year in the country&rsquo;s history . Visitors will pass through three tracks that combine the sounds of war and the roar of victory , between the battlefield and the sports field.The first track describes the reality for Israel&rsquo;s sporting representatives since October 7 , the humiliation and ostracism they face alongside the support and encouragement , and their victories on the sports field . Central to this part of the exhibition will be the historic gold medal of Israeli gymnast Artyom Dolgopiat , won at the World Championships on October 7 at 14:00 Israel time . The second track will memorialize the athletes murdered or wounded on October 7 and the ensuing war , while the third track will tell the story of the missing fans who will never wear their team colors again . & nbsp;The three tracks will converge to celebrate the victory of sports over evil & ndash ; the Olympic Games in Paris in July 2024 is due to include the largest Israeli delegation ever , and the 2025 Maccabiah looks like it will be the biggest in history . This exhibition will convey two main messages . To world Jewry : & ldquo;You are not alone . & rdquo ; And to the world sporting community , & ldquo;More Than Ever , & rdquo ; with record numbers of participants at the next Olympic Games and Maccabiah . ■ Staying on the mapFor decades , participation on the world stage was every Israeli athlete&rsquo;s dream . Nobody talked about winning & ndash ; until Maccabi Tel Aviv&rsquo;s groundbreaking first basketball European Champions Cup in 1977 . That game is best remembered for captain Tal Brody&rsquo;s prophetic after-game exclamation : & ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the map and we&rsquo;re staying on the map & ndash ; not only in sport , but in everything ! & rdquo ; a sound bite that has become a part of Israeli culture . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Israeli sports in general is continuing to improve , even through this tough period , & rdquo ; says Brody , now a sprightly 80 . & ldquo;In the past few months , we&rsquo;ve seen international achievements in judo , gymnastics , swimming , wind surfing , taekwondo , and even kick boxing . & rdquo ; & nbsp;It&rsquo;s time to stand up and be counted , even in sports that don&rsquo;t make the big headlines , explains Brody , who made aliyah from Trenton , New Jersey , in 1966 , forfeiting a budding NBA career.Still far from being a sporting powerhouse , Israel is beginning to make its mark on the world stage . Brody puts this down to a cultural shift . & ldquo;There&rsquo;s far more physical activity here than in the past . The authorities understand far better the importance of sporting facilities , and now our cities have bicycle lanes , and the parks are full of joggers . & ldquo;Israelis are waking up in a sad mood nowadays . Many have lost loved ones or have soldiers on the front line . With all the sorrow , as the day goes on sports gives them spirit and pride . Our athletes have to go out to the world where people don&rsquo;t understand the situation , where they hear false narratives and there&rsquo;s an antisemitic atmosphere . But the people of Israel believe in the country , and our sportsmen also feel this . Even as the war rages , our athletes are taking top places in competitions in places like Qatar and Tashkent , proudly competing with the Star of David on their uniforms . & rdquo ; & nbsp ;","sporting jews : the rise , fall , and rise of the ' muscular jew '"

For Shira , like the more than 7,200 families supported by the organization since 2001 , it helped her find herself again . & nbsp ; & nbsp;Support Israel&rsquo;s terror victims & gt ; & gt;Understanding the emotional complexities of the families of the victims of terror , OneFamily took the initiative to gradually reach out to Shira and her siblings , first attending the shiva of her father , and then over time developing a budding relationship that has turned into the central force that has allowed the Mark family to continue living . & ldquo;At first , it is just chaos , & rdquo ; she recalls . & ldquo;I had no idea what I needed , but OneFamily continued to reach out and provide us with everything we needed . & rdquo ; & ldquo;My mother and I began to attend ceramics classes in Jerusalem and group activities with other families of victims of terror , & rdquo ; Shira explains , adding that her mother continues to travel two hours to Jerusalem from their new home in the Golan Heights each week just so she does not miss a single ceramics class . & ldquo;They truly see you , and give us strength , the ability to breath and a connection with the larger community . & rdquo;But unfathomable tragedy struck again , just two and a half years after the death of her father , as Shira&rsquo;s oldest brother , Shlomi , was killed in a traffic accident while on his way to work at the Prime Minister&rsquo;s office in 2019 . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;The hardest part is how everything in my life fell apart , slowly got back together , and then fell apart again . & nbsp ; Even when you are surrounded by family in mourning , you still feel alone . There is something freeing about being with others who have experienced similar pain , & rdquo ; Shira explains , still smiling in the face of unimaginable tragedy through the support she has continued to receive through OneFamily over the course of eight years , & nbsp ; & ldquo;For my younger sisters and the children of my brother , OneFamily has been the most impactful thing in their lives , & rdquo ; she says . & ldquo;They have so much support and have made so many friends , attending summer camps and shabbatons , and I know that this is a place where they can share things that they cannot share anywhere else . & nbsp ; It is like a home , a place you can always count on . & rdquo;In the days following the October 7 attacks , Shira&rsquo;s shared pain compelled her to take her professional experience as a clinical social worker to support the community of Kibbutz Kfar Aza , only to find her life torn apart yet again as her younger brother , Pedayah , a platoon commander with the Givati Brigade , was killed in a rocket explosion in Gaza on October 31.Support Israel&rsquo;s terror victims & gt ; & gt ; & ldquo;Maybe it is because I have spent so many years in mourning , but I could recognize myself within all this , & rdquo ; Shira says . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Last week , I cried for days , but I know that it is OK too , & rdquo ; Shira adds of OneFamily&rsquo;s annual Remembrance Day Ceremony , which will take place May 12 in Jerusalem&rsquo;s International Convention Center to a sold-out audience.Shira , who will be one of the featured speakers , shares that each year OneFamily community members have a tradition of sitting together with a beer , as they laugh and cry , comfort each other and provide a safe space to process their complex emotions , as Remembrance Day reopens the fresh wounds felt by millions around the world . & nbsp ; & nbsp;While OneFamily has created a model for national support in the face of terrorism , a stark reality that many Western countries do not share , more than 60,000 Israelis have joined the list of victims of terror will statistically leave thousands to fall through the cracks , just as Shira would have without the immediate response of the organization . & nbsp;This article was written in cooperation with OneFamily . & nbsp ;","for bereaved israelis , remembrance day is hard . onefamily is standing with them"

"" I ask that in every sentence of your discussion today and when you go to sleep at night remember my mother , "" she stated.Yarden Gonen , sister of hostage Romi Gonen , told the members of the committee , "" I don't know what the solution is as was suggested here previously but I do know that you can't do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result because this is not what will happen . "" Mor Korngold , brother of hostage Tal Shoham , also addressed a Knesset committee , asking "" How can I raise my children here ? How can I say ' yes ' to reserve duty ? I went to the army and I know that no one is left behind .

Forces subsequently removed them . & nbsp;The police added that it had detained for questioning seven demonstrators on suspicion that they had attempted to block the highway with vehicles and wanted to ignite a fire in the area . The police further said that the suspects did not provide explanations as to why they had with them incendiary materials , wooden planks , tires etc.The police also affirmed that the seven suspects are expected to be brought to court hours after their arrest.A statement released by the Brothers and Sisters in Arms movement countered police arguments , noting & ldquo;there was no intention to set fire to vehicles or block the road , & rdquo ; but rather the & ldquo;vehicles in the convoy had been burned in advance , without engines , as a symbol of the legacy of the government . & rdquo ; The statement further affirmed there had been no justifiable cause for the arrests . & nbsp;The movement also asserted that the demonstrators had been at the side of the road and were not blocking traffic.Later on Monday evening , thousands protested outside the Knesset against the government and called for the return of the hostage , according to Israeli media reports .",hostage family members call for return of hostages at knesset committees
2022-08-14 21:45:30.927,jpost,"The UN must reinstate the head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in the Occupied Palestinian Territory , after she was dismissed for tweeting dismay at & ldquo;indiscriminate rocket fire&rdquo ; by Palestinian Islamic Jihad , Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan said Sunday.OCHA head Sarah Muscroft tweeted last Monday that she was & ldquo;relieved to see a ceasefire agreed ending hostilities impacting both Palestinians and Israeli civilians . Such indiscriminate rocket fire of Islamic Jihad provoking Israeli retaliation is condemned . The safety of all civilians is paramount & ndash ; the ceasefire must be upheld . & rdquo;Under pressure from pro-Palestinian activists who claimed Muscroft was blaming Palestinians for Operation Breaking Dawn , which began with Israeli strikes against an Islamic Jihad cell in Gaza the IDF said was planning to fire anti-tank missiles across the border , the UN staffer deleted her tweet a day later . & ldquo;One of my previous tweets was ill-informed and I have deleted it , & rdquo ; Muscroft wrote . & ldquo;I sincerely apologize for my poor judgment . All civilians & ndash ; everywhere & ndash ; must be able to live in peace . & rdquo;In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres , Erdan said that firing Muscroft over the tweet & ldquo;effectively grants the Palestinian players and the local UN staff an & lsquo;unwritten veto&rsquo ; over UN statements , and stands in clear contradiction with the basic principles of objectivity and neutrality that the UN claims to hold . & rdquo;The tweet & ldquo;effectively grants the Palestinian players and the local UN staff an & lsquo;unwritten veto&rsquo ; over UN statements , and stands in clear contradiction with the basic principles of objectivity and neutrality that the UN claims to hold . & rdquo;Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan&ldquo;This represents a clear surrender of the UN to threats and intimidation , and poses a very problematic norm , & rdquo ; he added.The ambassador pointed out that last year , Matthew Schmale , a representative of UNRWA , the UN agency for Palestinian refugees , said in a televised interview that & ldquo;there is a huge sophistication in the way the Israeli military struck over the last 11 days , & rdquo ; to try to avoid civilian casualties.Following a Palestinian backlash , Schmale apologized and was recalled from his post.At the same time , Erdan recalled , Miloon Kothari , a member of the UN Human Rights Council&rsquo;s Commission of Inquiry on Israel said , & ldquo;We are very disheartened by the social media that is controlled largely by & ndash ; whether it is the Jewish lobby or specific NGOs . & rdquo;Erdan said Kothari&rsquo;s comments were & ldquo;a clear case in which a UN official who clearly breached the principles of impartiality and neutrality required from a member of an HRC Commission of Inquiry used clear antisemitic vicious parlance , and yet still maintains his position . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Kothari&rsquo;s interview . . . should have been met with a firm response that would have led to his resignation , & rdquo ; Erdan wrote . & ldquo;While Israel supports constructive engagement with UN officials and agencies , we cannot accept such blatant double standards . & rdquo ; & ldquo;While Israel supports constructive engagement with UN officials and agencies , we cannot accept such blatant double standards . & rdquo;Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gilad ErdanKothari apologized for his statement earlier this month after UNHRC President Federico Villegas called on him to do so and at least 18 countries , including the US , plus the European Union and Guterres&rsquo;s office , called his remarks antisemitic .",un should reinstate staffer sacked for tweet against ‘ indiscriminate rocket fire ’ - erdan

2024-06-19 04:21:31.920,jpost,"Recently , there has been a flood of requests for monetary help on serious health issues ; widowed mothers of large families left destitute ; a haredi man who naively agreed to put an extra parcel in his luggage , not knowing that it contained cocaine , is languishing in prison , with his wife claiming that he is dying there ; and a whole bunch of other requests for aid.Most are truly heartbreaking , but they raise certain doubts . In nearly all cases , they appear to be from members of haredi communities . They are written in perfect English , even though they come from people who supposedly learned minimal English at school . The personal address of the sender is omitted , so there&rsquo;s no way to check the authenticity of the story , which makes receivers of such messages & ndash ; some of which come at the rate of three or four a day & ndash ; feel guilty when the request is to save the life of a baby with a brain tumor or a severe heart problem.But the ones that really arouse suspicion are posts from brides who , on the day before the wedding , still don&rsquo;t have the money to purchase a wedding dress , let alone refreshments for the guests.First of all , in haredi and also non-haredi circles , there&rsquo;s a traditional charitable outlet called a gemah ( an abbreviation of gemilut hassadim , meaning giving charity , doing good deeds ) which provides wedding dresses and formal wear free of charge , or at a symbolic rental cost to all and sundry . In the case of an orphan bride or one who comes from a needy family , in the haredi community neighbors band together to provide a modest repast to celebrate the occasion . So there is no need for alleged brides to ask for help in purchasing a wedding gown , when they can get one gratis.But there are genuine cases , which should have where to turn , in addition to any help they may receive from local and government welfare services.An example is a same-sex couple , Michal and Rotem and their four-year-old daughter , Omer , who were rescued from the atrocities surrounding their home on Kibbutz Be&rsquo;eri . One of the women was six months pregnant and subsequently gave birth to twins . The babies brought much light and joy into the lives of their parents , but unfortunately , one of them , Shahar , was born with a severe heart defect that urgently requires surgery.The surgery he needs is not available in Israel and can be performed only in Boston . The cost is prohibitive , and there is nothing that either of the mothers owns that can be sold to pay for the expenses involved . While the Boston Jewish community might be of some assistance , it is unlikely that it could cover all the costs . Anyone who wants to help , may do so via https : / / yanshufim.giveback.co.il/Our_Heart_HeLooking into newly-elected Mexican president's Jewish pastMOST PEOPLE who are second - or third-generation Holocaust survivors make a point of telling the stories of parents or grandparents who were actual survivors . Apparently , this does not apply to Mexico&rsquo;s recently elected president , Claudia Sheinbaum , who is her country&rsquo;s first female and first Jewish president-elect.Writing in The Forward , Andrew Silverstein noted that Sheinbaum has stated that her mother was born in Mexico , whereas records suggest she was born in Bulgaria and survived the Holocaust . One wonders why Sheinbaum would want to hide such a fact.ALTHOUGH HE spent a large part of his life away from his native Jerusalem , novelist and playwright A.B . Yehoshua , a graduate of Gymnasia Rehavia and the Hebrew University , will be commemorated in the city of his birth on the second anniversary of his death.The title of a tribute evening at Mishkenot Sha&rsquo;ananim , & ldquo;We had a Lover , & rdquo ; is based on lines from his 1977 novel , The Lover : & ldquo;We lost a lover in the last war . We had a lover , but since that war , we haven&rsquo;t had one . He simply disappeared . & rdquo;The evening , moderated by Avi Gil , will be completely dedicated to the admiration and yearning for Yehoshua and will feature the launch of Gil&rsquo;s biography , The Mission of A.B . Yehoshua , which covers the different stages in the life of the man considered to be the backbone of contemporary Hebrew literature.Among other participants will be actress Michal Bat-Adam , who directed and starred in the film The Lover ; Yair Kedar , who directed the film The Last Chapter of A.B . Yehoshua , parts of which will be screened during the evening ; book reviewer Dan Meron , who was also a close friend of Yehoshua ; and Prof . Eilat Shamir , who was a student and friend of the author&rsquo;s son Gidi Yehoshua.WITH REGARD to films , Roni Mahadav-Levin , the CEO of the Jerusalem Cinematheque , is giving film buffs ample notice to save the date for the 41st annual Jerusalem Film Festival , which traditionally takes place in the summer , while the annual Jewish film festival takes place in the winter.The Jerusalem Film Festival will be held July 18-27 , 2024 , in an effort to restore what used to be perceived as normal life.The festival is being held with the support of the Culture Ministry , the Van Leer Foundation , and the Jerusalem Foundation . & ldquo;Sadly , this is not the first time that the festival is being held in the shadow of war , & rdquo ; said Mahadav-Levin . & ldquo;But both in good times and difficult times , we believe in the need to create and screen good films , in the belief in the power of the art of film in strengthening , healing , and giving hope that a different reality is possible . & ldquo;This can be seen through the myriad of films that will be shown during the festival . & rdquo;VP Harris views Oct . 7 documentary&nbsp;FOLLOWING SCREENINGS in Israel of Screams Before Silence , the moving documentary in which philanthropist and former Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg meets Supernova music festival survivors and returned hostages , the film was shown in part at the White House this week , where it was viewed by Vice President Kamila Harris , who was joined by Sandberg and returned hostage Amit Soussana.Soussana said that , while in captivity , she had no control over her mind , body , or soul . Although it was difficult for her to tell her story of sexual abuse and violence by Hamas , she said , it was more difficult to remain silent . & ldquo;We cannot look away , & rdquo ; said Harris . & ldquo;We must not be silent . & rdquo;A PHOTO exhibition designed to draw attention to the hostages still waiting to return from Gaza can be seen at Tel Aviv&rsquo;s Charles Bronfman Auditorium , and will remain on view till June 29.Hundreds of amateur and professional photographers from across the country submitted photos , and paring down the choice was extremely difficult.Perhaps photos not chosen can be sent to other cities , so that , in the final analysis , most will be seen by a wider public.Among people attending the opening were representatives of the hostage families , executive members of Bank Hapoalim and Yoman Masa ( Travelog ) , which sponsored the exhibition , and survivors of the October 7 Hamas assault , including Sharon Sharabi , whose brothers Yossi and Eli , were kidnapped from Kibbutz Be&rsquo;eri . Yossi was subsequently murdered . Eli&rsquo;s fate is unknown . His wife and two daughters were murdered.Merav Berger , the mother of Agam Berger , one of the IDF lookout team of observers who was abducted from Kibbutz Nahal Oz , came with other members of the Berger family . A photo by Dana Draznin under the title Homage to Agam features Agam&rsquo;s parents , Shlomo and Merav , holding the violin that Agam loved to play.The exhibition was the brainchild of Igal Bareket , Hapoalim&rsquo;s chief marketing officer , who happens to be an avid amateur photographer . Bareket was on hand with Hapoalim CEO Dov Kotler and Yoman Masa owner Itamar Peleg.AS ONE of his final ceremonial deeds in office , Australian Governor-General David Hurley , as the representative in Australia of King Charles , conferred King Charles Birthday honors on more than 700 people , among them South African-born Prof .

She has been a member of the Australian Faculty of The Prince of Wales&rsquo;s Business & amp ; Sustainability Program for 12 years , and a senior associate in the international program.The daughter of an army officer , Mostyn is a lawyer by training , who launched her career as an associate in the Court of Appeal of the New South Wales Supreme Court , and has worked at law firms Freehills and Gilbert and Tobin . She has more recently been awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from the Australian National University.Mostyn has also had an extensive career in the Australian business community , including working at senior levels in telecommunications and insurance companies in Australia and globally . She has also held senior nonexecutive roles on boards , including Transurban and Virgin Australia , and has been chairwoman of Citibank Australia . She currently chairs AWARE Super and Alberts Music Group and is on the board of Mirvac.In addition , she has been a commissioner with the Australian Football League and a driving force behind the AFL Women&rsquo;s football.As if all that is not enough , Mostyn has chaired multiple not-for-profit boards , including Beyond Blue , the Foundation of Young Australians , Australians Investing in Women , Ausfilm , the Australian National Research Organization for Women&rsquo;s Safety , and Australian Volunteers International . She has been president of the Australian Council for International Development and president of Chief Executive Women , as well as a National Mental Health Commission commissioner.The governor-general holds office at the pleasure of the king . However , the term is usually understood to be five years . It will be interesting to see what Mostyn will accomplish during that period.IT&rsquo;S DIFFICULT to measure patriotism or even to define it . People of totally opposing views may regard themselves as patriots and the others as traitors . In Israel , the latter connotation usually goes hand in hand with being called a leftist , whereas , when the boot is on the other foot , one of the unsavory epithets is & ldquo;fascist . & rdquo;A battle over patriotism is brewing between two social media combatants , Yair Netanyahu , the elder son of the prime minister , and Ran Rahav , one of Israel&rsquo;s leading public relations executives.In recent days , Yair Netanyahu released a video in which he denigrates IDF Chief of Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi , Israel Security Agency head Ronen Bar , and former head of Military Intelligence Maj . - Gen . Aharon Haliva , who resigned after acknowledging the intelligence failure that led to the October 7 massacre.Accompanying a montage of the trio is a caption : & ldquo;Who appointed you ? & rdquo ; Further along is an attack on Benny Gantz , who has previously been targeted by Netanyahu Jr.Did his father not tell him that things like that are not done in a time of war ? Many influential political , diplomatic , and military experts have attributed the Hamas assault on Israel to the perception that a divided society is weak and vulnerable . What was Netanyahu Jr . thinking in driving the wedge further than it is already?Rahav , who never hesitates to speak his mind over what he considers to be injustice , was fast in using his X account and his own brand of scorn . He suggested that Netanyahu Jr . desist from opening his mouth against the defense establishment during the war for as long as the State of Israel pays for him to have a bodyguard . & ldquo;It costs millions , & rdquo ; wrote Rahav . & ldquo;The least you can do is respect the Israeli taxpayer . After the war , there will be a State Commission of inquiry , headed by an emeritus president of the Supreme Court , and you can testify before it . But until then , someone protected by his state cannot open his mouth in a time of war . & rdquo;A THREE-DAY day festival of tours and literary activities for the junior generation will be held at the National Library of Israel in celebration of Hebrew Book Week.Events will be held Monday through Wednesday , June 24-26 , 4 p.m . - 11 p.m . , and will include musical performances , meetings , tours , and various activities for children & ndash ; all dedicated to Hebrew literature and creativity.Among the events will be a musical performance on Monday , hosted by Lior Ashkenazi , to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Israel&rsquo;s poet laureate Yehuda Amichai .

Wassem Mahmoud , who was due to be released from the Army on April 1 , but insisted on going back into Gaza to fight with his comrades.It is part of the Druze tradition to be absolutely loyal to the host country of which they are citizens , but the Israel government does not respect this , and in the opinion of members of the Druze community , they are treated as second-class citizens.Halabi said that heads of Druze local councils had met with Netanyahu last week to express their concerns about receiving inadequate budgets from the state , and to continue their protests against the Nation-State Law.Halabi and Dabbour also made the point that on a percentage basis , Beit Jann has the highest army casualty rate in the country.They could not understand why a community that has given so much receives so little in return . Dabbour also noted that soldiers who fall behind in paying their mortgages , or who have built homes without the proper legal permission , go to fight in Gaza , and return to find their homes destroyed on orders by the Israeli authorities.Bedouin trackers , who are among the best in the country and are also serving in the IDF , if they live in illegal villages may not find their homes when they return from the army . Their homes may have been bulldozed.How does Israel expect to maintain the loyalty of its minority communities , if it treats them in such an insensitive and disrespectful manner?THE BIG question on the minds of many Israelis is will Israel recover fully from October 7 ? To anyone who experienced the Yom Kippur War , the answer is yes . The misery and uncertainty that now encompass the country were in a sense even more horrific then than now , because there were no mobile phones , no fax , and not every home possessed a ground line telephone . The IDF death toll was 2,691 during a war that lasted for less than a month . As painful as the current IDF casualty rate is , there are far fewer fallen soldiers over a much longer period , though there have been a larger number of civilian casualties , particularly on October 7 itself.In the early days after the Hamas massacre , Shani Louk , a pretty 22-year-old dual national who carried German as well as Israeli citizenship , became the global symbol of Hamas tyranny and inhumanity.Kidnapped at the Supernova music festival by Hamas terrorists wearing body cams , a video of her unconscious body on the back of a truck was circulated around the globe.Her family clung to the hope that she was still alive , especially after information filtered through that she was being treated in a Gaza hospital.German Ambassador to Israel Steffen Seibert maintained close contact with the Louk family and helped to publicize its ordeal and Germany&rsquo;s concern.On October 30 , Shani Louk&rsquo;s death was confirmed.On Wednesday , June 19 , at 7 p.m . , her parents , Ricarda and Nissim Louk , will talk about the beloved , happy-go-lucky , music-loving daughter they remember at a special evening honoring Shani&rsquo;s memory . Sharing in that conversation , organized by Tribe Israel , will be Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.The venue is Capella , Hagag Tower , 28 Ha&rsquo;arba Street , Tel Aviv . Admission is free of charge . The event is reserved for people in Shani Louk&rsquo;s age-group.WITH THE ongoing transformation of the State of Israel that inter alia includes changes in the law , politics , the skyline , and the values we once held dear , the question arises as to whether future changes will include the establishment of a casino.The late casino mogul Sheldon Adelson wanted to establish a casino in Eilat so that the southern resort city would truly become the Las Vegas of the Middle East . But he was strongly opposed by a cabinet minister , the late Yosef Burg , who was afraid that a casino would become a den of vice , peddling drugs and promoting prostitution . Adelson&rsquo;s vision on that score was never realized.In an interview with the writer of this column , during the period in which he was still trying to convince the Israeli authorities , Adelson said that he had never seen anyone have sex on a gambling table.Since then , he married an Israeli and built casino empires in Singapore and Macao.Israelis like to gamble , and when the Hilton Taba casino opened in 1994 , only 200 meters from the Israeli border , gamblers crossed nightly from Eilat to Taba to place their bets . A lot of money that could have stayed in Israel ended up in Egypt.But before then and even afterward , several illegal and well-patronized casinos opened across Israel , but were short-lived due to police raids.The only legalized gambling in Israel is the Mifal Hapayis national lottery , which has increased the variety of games and prizes available to the public , and Toto sports gambling.Sheldon Adelson , who died three-and-a-half years ago , was a keen supporter of the Republican Party and one of its most generous bankrollers . Following his death , his wife Dr . Miriam Adelson was a little more reserved in her donations to the party but , according to media reports , is now throwing her financial weight behind Donald Trump , who during his presidency honored her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.Recently , Miriam Adelson and her son-in-law Patrick Dumont acquired the majority shares in the Dallas Mavericks in order to give the Las Vegas Sands Corporation a foothold in the Lone Star State , where they hope to introduce casinos . Texas is very conservative about casino gambling , so Adelson and Dumont will have a hard row to hoe.She also poured a lot of money into the election campaign of Dade Phelan , which helped him to be reelected as speaker of the Texas House of Representatives.If she succeeds in opening a casino in Texas , Adelson may turn her attention to Israel , where she is the publisher of the free , informative tabloid Israel Hayom.She is also a generous benefactor to various Israeli causes . She and her husband gave Yad Vashem its largest-ever donations , and they did not skimp on other causes they supported.At a time when Israel is experiencing an economic disaster , Adelson&rsquo;s fiscal assistance to the nation may help to swing legislation in favor of casinos.greerfc@gmail.com","grapevine june 19 , 2024 : scams vs authenticity"
2021-02-20 23:06:52.863,jpost,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was coy about&nbsp ; media reports of a secret deal in which Israel agreed to purchase Russian Sputnik COVID-19 vaccines on behalf of Syria as part of last week&rsquo;s prisoner exchange with Syria . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Not a single Israeli COVID-19 vaccine went for that matter , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said at a public appearance on Saturday , during which he was quizzed on the issue by a KAN reporter . & nbsp ; Netanyahu referred to the deal brokered by Russian President Vladimir Putin in which a young Israeli woman who had wandered into Syria was returned in exchange for the release of two Syrian shepherds . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We brought back the young woman and I have thanked President Putin for this , but I respect Russia&rsquo;s request not to say anything more , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said . & nbsp ; Speculation with regard to a secret component to the deal has been fueled by an unusual secret government meeting held Wednesday night in advance of an otherwise seemingly simple exchange . & nbsp ; Labor Party head MK Merav Michaeli appealed to Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee chairman Zvi Hauser to hold a debate on the decision to censor information about the deal . & nbsp ; & ldquo;There is a real concern , sir , that Prime Minister Netanyahu and [ Alternate Prime Minister and ] Defense Minister [ Benny ] Gantz have abused their authority and censored the full details of the agreement to prevent a public debate&rdquo ; on the price of the deal , Michaeli said . & nbsp ; Among those who reported on the matter was Richard Silverstein in his Tikun Olam blog . & ldquo;Today , a well-informed Israeli source has revealed the full extent of the negotiation . Russia , in order to sweeten the deal , proposed that Israel pay millions for several million doses of the former&rsquo;s SPUTNIK COVID vaccine to be administered to millions of Syrians . Israel agreed ( hence the cabinet signoff ) , & rdquo ; Silverstein wrote . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;But both Bibi Netanyahu and Benny Gantz do not want Israelis to know that they are offering such resources to Syria , especially because they are in the midst of the election campaign , & rdquo ; he added . & nbsp ; Syria&rsquo;s state news agency SANA rejected the report . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Circulating such fabricated information about a secret term in the exchange process , related to getting coronavirus vaccines from the Israeli authorities , aim to defame Syria and distort the patriotic and humanitarian side of the process , & rdquo ; it stated . & nbsp ; According to KAN News , Israel requested permission from Russia to disclose what was promised to Syria under the prisoner swap deal , but the Kremlin reportedly has not & ldquo;changed its position on the issue . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The issue was noted by Joint List faction chairman Ahmad Tibi in a Friday tweet . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Do we have to wait for a Jew to cross the border into Gaza in order for [ Palestinians ] to receive vaccines ? & rdquo ; Tibi wrote , following a comment on how he had raised a demand in the Knesset for vaccines to be transferred to Gaza . The young woman who crossed into Syria returned to Israel in the early hours of Friday , after government hostage negotiator Yaron Bloom headed to Moscow on Thursday night to bring her back . & nbsp ; On Thursday , the IDF handed over two shepherds to Red Cross representatives through the Quentin Crossing in Syria , after they had been apprehended by IDF troops east of the security fence in the Golan Heights area in Israeli territory . & nbsp ; Following her return , Netanyahu spoke with the young woman&rsquo;s mother who thanked him for his efforts , according to a PMO statement . & ldquo;Israel will always do everything in its power in order to help its citizens , & rdquo ; Netanyahu said . & nbsp ; The prime minister also issued a statement thanking Putin for his efforts , noting he had spoken with him twice . & nbsp ; Gantz also released a statement explaining that he had spoken with his Russian counterpart on the matter and publicly thanked him . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Two weeks ago , we received an alert that an Israeli citizen had been taken into the custody of Syrian security forces . She willingly decided to cross the border - an incident which we&rsquo;ll continue to investigate . & nbsp ; & ldquo;We immediately began working to ensure her swift return .

2024-04-21 03:57:45.440,jpost,"When Israel needed water in the desert , we created pioneering irrigation technologies . When faced with non-conventional threats , we became a cyber empire . In the wake of the October 7 tragedy , Israel is still facing a whole new host of problems . These challenges , though new to Israelis , are too familiar to many countries that experience natural and man-made disasters . Sadly , these disasters are growing in frequency and severity.The awful experience that October 7 forced upon us can break us or lead to the development of the most powerful impact-tech ecosystem the world has ever seen , changing the trajectory of this space forever . This will not be an easy opportunity to seize , but we believe that we must go all in & ndash ; it will serve our recovery process , it&rsquo;s an opportunity to play a role in addressing global challenges , and it offers an incredible economic engine if we do it right . Disasters are not going away , but our innovative response can turn adversity into opportunity.Much has been written about Israel as the Start-up Nation , the blossoming , Middle Eastern tech miracle where there are more start-ups per capita than anywhere else on the planet.Israel&rsquo;s tech ecosystem unsurprisingly focuses on sectors such as cyber , fintech , and enterprise solutions ; and with good reason . The ecosystem grew under the influence of foreign tech leaders and venture capitalists with backgrounds in corporates , the military , and finance , and was fueled by innovation from the IDF . This influence has paved the way for Israeli founders to focus on problems affecting companies and institutions in the US and Western societies & ndash ; a sensible approach given the financial opportunities in these areas and the first-hand experience of the ecosystem veterans who were able to mentor , fund , and support entrepreneurs working on problems they knew.OCTOBER 7 and subsequent events have thrust all Israelis into uncharted territory . Despite struggling with disbelief and contending with a government that is untrusted and not functioning ideally , Israelis and their allies around the world have responded with what we believe will be remembered in history as one of the best community responses to a disaster . CEOs became philanthropists , conference spaces became donation centers , volunteers were organized to replace workers drafted into reserve service , and a jaw-dropping amount of donations was collected.Unsurprisingly & ndash ; we also witnessed an extraordinary surge in ad hoc & lsquo;emergency&rsquo ; hacks . New tech solutions were developed to identify and track people in distress , provide rapid response documentation solutions in field conditions , leverage CRMs for data management of displaced individuals , utilize AI to identify missing and kidnapped people , and more.As Israel transitions from emergency response to recovery , we are starting to see a similar innovative spirit in addressing long-term recovery issues.Innovating recoveryOne example is Citizen AI & ndash ; a fintech start-up that leverages its financial education platform to help individuals and organizations understand their rights and navigate the complex benefits system . Utilization of rights and financial health is not a new problem in Israel ( nor around the world ) , but now , the flood of people in need and the new programs are driving focus and clarity to what is required.In the agriculture sector , programs such as ReGrow Israel are not only focused on building what was destroyed , but are also seizing the opportunity to build a more advanced , tech-enabled , and resilient agricultural ecosystem . These programs have the potential to not only strengthen the food system that sustains the country and supports the livelihoods of families of farmers and other businesses on the value chain & ndash ; but also to provide critical insights and learning to fuel AgTech companies.We are seeing a surge in innovation in the physical and mental health space . With so many individuals working to recover and integrate back into society and the dozens of people surrounding them , in a place like Israel , this can only mean one thing : more ground-breaking ideas and solutions.One example is the Lev Hasharon Mental Health Center where cutting-edge technologies such as VR are integrated into the care plans of mental health patients , in departments such as hospitalization , daycare , and specialized clinics for sexual trauma and child-and-youth mental support . Patient feedback has been exceptionally positive , with about 70 % reporting significant reduction in anxiety and stress levels.All these programs and ideas were not born in a vacuum . They were bred and incubated through an incredible impact-tech ecosystem that already exists in Israel . However , they are the minority , underfunded , and under-supported , and this must change . As these sectors are growing globally and creating more demand & ndash ; now is the time to double down on these opportunities.This can be a defining moment or a grossly missed opportunity for Israel&rsquo;s Tech Ecosystem and its national economy . We must take this terrible disaster and the challenges it forced us to experience & ndash ; and do what we do best . Solve . Innovate . Build . And scale for the greater good and the benefit of all.For this to happen , everyone needs to play a role ; there is a lot of work to do . We need to close knowledge gaps about new markets , fund experimentation , and bring together people who are not used to collaborating with each other , such as social workers , engineers , NGO leaders , investors , nurses , and salespeople & ndash ; we need them all to bring multidisciplinary knowledge and experience to the table.We built PollyLabs to bridge the tech gap and exponentially accelerate solutions to the world&rsquo;s most pressing needs . Like everyone , October 7 threw us all into a stark place , both personally and professionally . It also brought into sharp focus the tremendous opportunity for Israel to build and heal itself and others like never before . & nbsp;Let&rsquo;s take on this role ; we were made for this.Bar Pereg is the CEO of PollyLabs .

2023-01-29 19:37:42.637,jpost,"In February 2005 , during the government of then-prime minister Ariel Sharon , then-defense minister Shaul Mofaz and IDF chief Moshe Ya&rsquo;alon ordered a moratorium of punitive house demolitions against the families of Palestinian terrorists.A commission of top defense experts led by Maj . - Gen . ( res . ) Udi Shani had empirically studied whether house demolitions over the last few years of the Second Intifada had increased deterrence against terrorists , concluding that the opposite was true.Yet in 2023 , it seems that nearly the entire defense establishment is convinced that house demolitions do deter future potential terror attacks.They are so sure that they even want to seal off the house of the family of the 13-year-old Palestinian who shot but did not kill , two Israeli victims & ndash ; which would be the first time that such a measure would be taken against an attempted murderer versus an actual murderer.What , if anything , changed between 2005 and 2023 about Israel , the Palestinians , house demolitions and deterrence?The 2005 committee found that house demolitions , rather than deterring future terrorism , generally inflamed hatred and increased motivation for future attacks by Palestinians against Israel.According to the defense commission , there had only been 20 cases in which the threat of demolition deterred potential attackers or pushed their families to turn them in & ndash ; out of hundreds of demolitions since 2001.Fundamentally , the commission report simply pointed out that after hundreds of demolitions , the Second Intifada had not been put down.Furthermore , the report said that in many cases house demolitions hit families which , other than the one terrorist attacker , were not part of a greater terror group and were viewed by the greater Palestinian public as illegitimate collective punishment.This meant that sometimes new terrorists were even being created from families or neighbors of these families who might not have become a problem.Another part of the problem , the committee said , was that different Palestinian groups , whether the Palestinian Authority , Hamas or otherwise , frequently compensated families of terrorists and helped them rebuild new homes , weakening possible deterrence.In addition , if there had been some short period earlier in the Second Intifada when a small number of demolitions might have had a deterrent effect , as the policy went on longer , the deterrent effect was lost.With some very limited exceptions , Israel stopped demolishing Palestinian houses for punitive deterrent purposes from 2005-2014 & ndash ; almost a decade.It was after Palestinian terrorists murdered three Jewish teenagers that the then-government of Benjamin Netanyahu ( who went almost five years without demolitions ) reinstated the demolitions policy.The issue was probed again by the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) during the 2015-2016 Knife Intifada , but this time the overwhelming majority of officials found that the demolitions were having a deterrent effect.Significant numbers of Palestinians who started toward an attack , but relented , or parents who turned in their kids before they could commit an attack in process , said that saving the family house had impacted them greatly.Some officials did a victory lap on the issue in 2016 as one of the reasons & ndash ; along with new technologies and analysis of social media & ndash ; that the Knife Intifada was put down before it blew up into a & ldquo;full Intifada . & rdquo;The Jerusalem Post recently received additional confirmations from defense officials dealing with some of the greatest Palestinian violence in the northern West Bank which concluded that demolitions are still providing deterrence.They repeated the same updated 2022 testimonies of Palestinians ( not just relying on the 2015-2016 data ) who pulled back from terror at the last minute or turned in their kids to stop them from terror.One fascinating point was that some of these officials did not even know that Israel&rsquo;s moratorium on house demolitions had gone on for so long , nearly a decade . In fact , they were quite shocked by the notion.Part of what is interesting about that is that the years 2005-2014 & ndash ; without house demolitions & ndash ; were a much less violent time period than 2015-2023 has been with house demolitions.Of course , one counterresponse to this argument is that this was because the IDF hit Palestinian terror much harder and deeper during the Second Intifada , and it was this that provided quiet.Some also say that if the IDF did house demolitions faster , not with weeks or months of delay , then there would be greater deterrence . Maybe , but there is no guarantee there either , and there have been cases where a terrorist&rsquo;s family had nothing to do with their activities and rushing forward without figuring that out would have broken even Israeli law as it currently exists ( keeping in mind that though international law has a place for house demolitions , Israel is an outlier among democracies in actually performing them ) . Some other questions worth askingBut it is worth asking ; when Israeli defense officials in 2023 say they are sure that demolitions provide deterrence , are they fully and seriously considering the opposing view?If some of them do not even recall a world without house demolitions , can they be said to fully consider that view?And if Israel has been doing them more aggressively than ever since March 2022 without ending the current waves of violence , what does that say?There are no easy answers to these questions .

The poll , which collected data from 8,000 Arab respondents from 16 countries , aimed to determine how Arab populations perceived the Israel-Hamas war.Amongst one of the many findings of the survey , it was noted that 67 % of respondents perceived Hamas&rsquo;s October 7 attack , categorized by the survey as & ldquo;the military operation carried out by Hamas , & rdquo ; as & ldquo;a legitimate resistance operation . & rdquo ; The survey results clarified that 19 % answered that the attack was legitimate but & ldquo;flawed , & rdquo ; 3 % said it was legitimate but & ldquo;involved heinous or criminal acts&rdquo ; and only 5 % called the attack & ldquo;illegitimate . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Why did Hamas attack , according to respondents?While many have seen Hamas&rsquo;s attack on Israel as a proxy war for Iran , only 2 % of respondents agreed , while 35 % of Arab respondents stated their belief that the number one reason behind the attack was & ldquo;The ongoing Israeli occupation of Palestinian land . & rdquo;The second most given reason was & ldquo;Defending al-Aqsa Mosque against attacks , & rdquo ; which 24 % of respondents affirmed as their believed reason . & nbsp;The al-Aqsa Mosque has been a source of tension as it is located above the Temple Mount , a holy site for both Jews and Christians . While non-Muslims now have permission to attend their holy site via the Moors Gate , they are forbidden from praying there which has created increased tension . Jewish activists have repeatedly tried to pray at the site , which has been met with escalating conflict . & nbsp;While 24 % argued that defending the mosque was the most important reason behind the attack , a Hamas rocket would have landed on the holy site in December , if Israel&rsquo;s Iron Dome system hadn&rsquo;t prevented the attack . & nbsp;Only 8 % of the respondents felt the & ldquo ; [ t]he ongoing blockade of Gaza&rdquo ; was the main reason for the attack , with a further 12 % claiming it to be the second most important reason . & nbsp;Israel withdrew citizens from Gaza in 2005 , creating a separate territory that was taken over by Hamas in 2006 . Gaza borders both Israel and Egypt , with crossings policed heavily by both countries . Palestinians , before October 7 , had been permitted to enter Israel with proper documentation for work , medical treatments or for other reasons . & nbsp;Arab solidarity with Palestinians and HamasIn mass agreement , 92 % of respondents expressed they had a feeling of solidarity with Gaza&rsquo;s Palestinian population . In addition , 69 % said they supported both the Palestinians and Hamas . Only 1 % said they had no feelings of solidarity with the Palestinians and 23 % said they had feelings of solidarity for Palestinians but opposed Hamas.Opinions on international partiesWhen asked about the responses of regional and international powers to the war , 94 % said they considered the United States position negatively , with 82 % clarifying they thought it was bad . The same trend continued for other Western countries with 79 % , 78 % , and 75 % of respondents viewed the positions of France , the UK , and Germany negatively.In a different survey response , 81 % said that they did not believe the US was serious about establishing a Palestinian state and 77 % of respondents named the US and Israel as the biggest threat to the security and stability of the region.US Secretary of State Andrew Blinken continued to advocate for a Palestinian state only yesterday , claiming that it was the best way to marginalize Iran . & nbsp;Additionally , while one May survey found that over half of Palestinians wanted a two-state solution , a November survey by the Arab World for Research and Development found that over 70 % of Palestinians support only a singular Palestinian state without a Jewish one.Arab opinion on Iran , Turkey , Russia , and China was more split , with 48 % , 47 % , 41 % , and 40 % perceiving the countries positively.Normalizing ties with IsraelWhen asked what steps Arab governments should take in response to the war , 36 % of respondents stated that Arab governments should suspend all relations or normalization processes with Israel , and a further 14 % said aid should be sent to Gaza without Israeli approval.A further 29 % of respondents suggested that Arab countries should either & ldquo;provide military aid to Gaza&rdquo ; or & ldquo;announce military mobilization&rdquo ; against Israel .",67 % of arab world : october 7 was ' legitimate resistance ' against israel

2023-06-24 19:18:22.727,jpost,"Villagers in Beita , south of Nablus , decided to resume daily protests against the settler outpost of Aviatar shortly after National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir visited the area on Friday.During the protests in 2021 , seven Palestinians were killed and dozens injured in clashes with IDF troops . Most of the protests took place at night and after Friday prayers.The protests were suspended in July 2021 after the settlers evacuated the caravans at the site.On Friday , Ben-Gvir visited the outpost , located in an area the Palestinians call Jabal Sabih , and called for a wide military offensive to kill thousands of terrorists and for increased settlement construction.After the visit , activists from the village said they will resume the & ldquo;night confusion&rdquo ; activities against the IDF in the area . The activities previously included burning tires , setting off fireworks and throwing rocks and Molotov cocktails at soldiers and settlers . & ldquo;There needs to be a full settlement here . Not just here but on all the hilltops around us , & rdquo ; Ben-Gvir said . & ldquo;We have to settle the Land of Israel and at the same time to launch a military campaign , blow up buildings and kill terrorists . Not one , or two , but dozens , hundreds , or if needed , thousands . & rdquo;Ben-Gvir&rsquo;s statements drew strong condemnations from the Palestinian Authority.Ben-Gvir's statements denouncedThe Palestinian Foreign Affairs Ministry denounced Ben-Gvir&rsquo;s statements as & ldquo;abhorrent and genocidal&rdquo ; and said they demonstrate & ldquo;clear criminal and murderous intent . & rdquo;In a statement , the ministry said that such & ldquo;odious comments reflect Israel&rsquo;s abject disregard of Palestinian lives and the pervasive culture of impunity in Israel with regard to Palestinian lives and rights . & rdquo;These statements , the ministry said , & ldquo;were made in the context of providing support and encouragement to Israeli settlers to commit yet more war crimes . & rdquo;It accused the international community of failing to hold Israel accountable for its & ldquo;systematic and widespread egregious violations of international law and Palestinian rights . & rdquo;According to the Palestinian Ministry , the Israeli government is committing all these & ldquo;crimes while enjoying cover , protection and even pandering by key international players that amounts to outright complicity . It urged the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) Prosecutor to end his & ldquo;continued silence , procrastination and diminishing of the investigation into the situation in Palestine . & rdquo;Rawhi Fattouh , Chairman of the Palestinian National Council , the PLO&rsquo;s legislative body , also condemned Ben-Gvir&rsquo;s remarks as & ldquo;effrontery and direct incitement to terrorism and murder . & rdquo;Fattouh claimed that the statements of the Israeli minister reflect the & ldquo;fascist nature&rdquo ; of the Israeli government . He called on the ICC Prosecutor to issue an arrest warrant for Ben-Gvir and other Israelis like him and bring them to trial . He further called on the international community to classify the settlers as a & ldquo;terrorist organization whose members should be pursued and brought to trial . & rdquo;Fattouh added that statements of denunciation by the international community were insufficient because they have become too familiar and worthless as far as the Israeli government is concerned . & nbsp ;",palestinians to protest west bank settler outpost after ben-gvir visit
2024-03-19 20:43:01.737,jpost,"& ldquo;Major pressure&rdquo ; is being applied on outgoing Efrat Mayor Oded Revivi to join national politics , he said in an interview with The Jerusalem Post last week.The pressure is not new and has accompanied Revivi during the past five rounds of elections since 2019 , he said.But now that Revivi is on his way out of office , the door is open to upgrade to the national level , he said , adding that while there are & ldquo;major vectors&rdquo ; pushing him in that direction , it is still too early to tell . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s not attractive to go into national politics , & rdquo ; Revivi said . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s way more frustrating . It&rsquo;s way harder to make decisions , and most mayors want to stay mayors because they enjoyed [ the ] independence&hellip ; On the other hand , when we as mayors look about and we see how the central government is run , we have a lot of criticism , and we say that with our experience we can go and create a change there . & rdquo;Revivi claims entering national politics "" not attractive""Revivi , 55 , has served as mayor of Efrat since 2008 but lost in the recent election to Dudi Sheffler . During 2016-2020 , he was also the international liaison of the Council of Jewish Communities in Judea , Samaria , and the Gaza Strip , and he is an IDF lieutenant-colonel in the reserves.During his childhood , Revivi spent time in the US and UK . His wife immigrated to Israel from the UK , and his English is perfect , a rare commodity among Israeli politicians , in general , and religious ones , in particular.Not only does he speak English , but Revivi said he also knows how to & ldquo;understand English , & rdquo ; a skill that is lacking in the national arena.For example , Revivi , who attended former US president Donald Trump&rsquo;s inauguration ceremony by invitation , said while his colleagues gushed with excitement over Trump&rsquo;s support for Israel , he was more wary of the & ldquo;America first&rdquo ; foreign policy . The significance of this concept was lost on non-English-speaking politicians , he said.Fiery statements by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir against US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s policies indicate a lack of understanding of the importance of the US-Israel relationship , Revivi said.Biden is & ldquo;proving to be maybe the most friendly president to the State of Israel that Israel ever had , & rdquo ; he said . But Biden is a Democrat in an election year , and some of his policies , such as recent sanctions on several settlers , should be viewed in that light and not necessarily as an act against Israel , he added.Some ministers are acting & ldquo;as if they are equivalent to the president of the United States , & rdquo ; Revivi said . & ldquo;We&rsquo;re not talking about it between equals , & rdquo ; he added.The sanctions imposed by Biden were a mistake , Revivi said , adding that he would think about them differently . & ldquo;When a president of the United States says to the State of Israel , & lsquo;I don&rsquo;t rely on your judicial system ; I don&rsquo;t rely on you enforcing the law , & rsquo ; that is a problematic statement , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t have gone into that situation . & rdquo;Israel depends on the US for munitions , including Iron Dome missiles , and alienating the US could lead to rockets flying uninterrupted from Gaza to Tel Aviv , Revivi said.Cabinet ministers in current and past governments have also acted insensitivity toward US Jewry , he said . When ministers spoke out against the Kotel compromise to enable egalitarian prayer at an isolated segment of the Western Wall or against recognizing non-Orthodox conversion , they were not aware of the implications for US Jewry , he added . Similarly , when Israeli ministers call incessantly on Diaspora Jews to make aliyah , they are not always aware of the prices these Jews pay to do so , which often include a downgrade in living standards or salaries.At the beginning of the war against Hamas , & ldquo;A lot of donations came from the United States , a very hard-warming hug from the Jews in the Diaspora , & rdquo ; Revivi said . But they did not feel like Israelis had expressed their appreciation , and some felt that & ldquo;nobody was listening to them once the money came , & rdquo ; he said.Revivi said one of his accomplishments as mayor was that Efrat grew by 60 % during his tenure , including the eight years of the Obama administration , which viewed settlement expansion unfavorably . This required an understanding of the dynamics of Israeli-US relations and was another example of the value of leaders who have this understanding , he said.Revivi said he intends to use his ability to serve as a bridge between the US and Israel in his next endeavor , adding that he does not know whether this will be in the political arena , the Jewish relations arena , or elsewhere . & nbsp ;",‘ major pressure ’ on outgoing efrat mayor oded revivi to join national politics
2024-04-13 10:16:42.213,jpost,"Lihi Lapid , whose latest novel , On Her Own , was just published in the US by HarperVia , has a very unusual biography for a writer . & nbsp;While she is the author of a previous novel , Woman of Valor , which was also published in English to positive reviews , and several other books that came out in Israel , she is known around the world as the wife of Israel&rsquo;s previous prime minister , Yair Lapid , now head of the opposition . & nbsp;As we meet in the caf&eacute ; at the Israel Museum , a convenient location for the Tel Aviv-based novelist , who is set to attend a rally to protest the policies of the current government outside the Knesset in a few hours , where her husband will speak , many people recognize her and wish her well . & nbsp;Lapid acknowledged them gracefully , displaying the poise that she has acquired in a life in the harsh Israeli political spotlight . & ldquo;I&rsquo;m very involved in supporting Yair , not in terms of political decisions , but going out and campaigning , & rdquo ; she said . Still , it was important to her to keep writing , and she did much of her work & ldquo;in the twilight zone of the early morning hours , & rdquo ; during bouts of insomnia.As the well-wishers drifted away , before I could ask a question , she turned to me with one of her own , one that any author would ask : How did I like the book?My answer , that I thought it was a moving and suspenseful story , filled with beautiful writing and vivid scenes , and that I fell in love with the three complex women at its center , pleased her as if she were a first-time writer , and led me into my first question : Where did she get the idea for it ? & nbsp;The plot of the novelOn Her Own is about Nina , a teenage girl from Sderot born to Irena , a Ukrainian immigrant and single mother . A smart girl , Nina is nevertheless seduced by Johnny , a smalltime gangster who brings her for trysts to a Tel Aviv hotel . & nbsp;One night when she is with him there , she witnesses a violent crime he is involved in , and she flees and takes refuge with Carmela . & nbsp;Carmela is a lonely widow with dementia who has buried one son , a fallen soldier , and whose other son is busy with his family in America . Carmela has moments that are partly dementia and partly wishful thinking when she feels that her late son is still alive.She has also been dreaming that Dana , her granddaughter will come to visit , and when Nina shows up at her door , she foggily embraces the girl , thinking & ndash ; or hoping & ndash ; that she is the grandchild she hasn&rsquo;t seen in years . Meanwhile , Irena frantically searches for her daughter on the eve of the Passover holiday.She created these characters and told their stories through a complex writing process that took her several years . One inspiration was from a poem by Giora Fisher about a bereaved father with dementia . Lapid quoted the lines : & ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me , oy , but he&rsquo;s been gone a long time/Tell me , he just went out and he&rsquo;ll be back soon . & rdquo ; & nbsp;For her , this was the & ldquo;most heartbreaking poem I&rsquo;ve ever heard . . . . When I heard that poem , I knew that was the essence of Carmela , that she wants to be in that place where in just a moment , he&rsquo;ll return . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Nina came to life for her in a more circuitous route , when she imagined a teenage girl who is fleeing from a world of danger who meets Carmela on the stairs.For a long time , she had only vague thoughts about this scene and couldn&rsquo;t figure out what the rest of the story should be . She spoke with a woman who worked as a counselor at a center run by Elem , for at-risk youth , about how girls like Nina are preyed on by men like Johnny . & ldquo;And she told me , & lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t happen all at once . & rsquo ; . . . . Gradually , girls are drawn into this world . & rdquo;She also spent time speaking to single mothers who were recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union . & ldquo;One woman I have known for years . She is so talented and so smart , she has two children from different fathers , she gets up early , she works all day in the store so that her children will have a future . & nbsp;She lives for them . . . . And she exists almost completely in a Russian-speaking world . & rdquo;Her brother , Deddy , who lived in the US for decades , was an inspiration for the character , Itamar , Carmela&rsquo;s son who lives in America . Lapid&rsquo;s brother passed away from cancer after the book was finished and the book is dedicated to him . & ldquo;We were very close . . . . He knew me better than I know myself . He knew I would become a writer before I knew . & rdquo;Lapid may seem to be the ultimate Tel Aviv insider , and at first , it is surprising that she wrote about characters who live on the margins of society , but as you speak to her more , you begin to understand that she can identify with these characters because she also grew up feeling like an outsider.Born in Arad , a town where & ldquo;you visit for a minute to get a cup of coffee and to go to the bathroom when the bus stops on the way to Masada , & rdquo ; she moved with her parents , who ran a Judaica store , to the Tel Aviv area when she was in her teens and struggled to fit in . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The distance between a place like Sderot or Arad and Tel Aviv can be even longer than the distance between Tel Aviv and New York , & rdquo ; she noted . & nbsp;Working as a photojournalist in Tel Aviv after the army , when she first met and then married Yair , she initially felt intimidated by his distinguished family . Yair Lapid was an actor and author at that time , and his father , Tommy Lapid , was a politician and a journalist , while his mother , Shulamit Lapid , is an acclaimed novelist . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I took literature courses at the university to keep up with them , so I wouldn&rsquo;t seem like an idiot at their family dinners , where they spoke about literature and art all the time . & rdquo;She turned to writing after she suffered two miscarriages and was put on bedrest when she was pregnant with her son , Lior , and needed a way to express herself that didn&rsquo;t involve running around Tel Aviv on a motorcycle with a camera . & nbsp ; & ldquo;When Lior was born , I understood that no newspaper is looking for a photographer who has to nurse every four hours . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Another way in which Lapid looks at the world differently from how you might expect is that her daughter , Yael , is on the autism spectrum . I have known Lapid slightly for many years because I also have a son on the spectrum the same age as her daughter , and she is the president of SHEKEL , an organization for people with special needs in Israel . & nbsp;Both of the Lapids have been upfront about their struggles raising their daughter . At first , after Yael&rsquo;s diagnosis , Lapid was consumed by trying to help her , to the exclusion of everything else . & ldquo;I was a wreck , I didn&rsquo;t want to see anyone , I didn&rsquo;t want to work , I just wanted to save her , I tried to do everything for her . . . . There was a very dramatic moment , where Yair said to me , & lsquo;You have other children who need you . & nbsp;And you have me , and I need you . Yaeli will be who she is for life , she&rsquo;s not a project for a couple of years , it&rsquo;s not like she&rsquo;ll go swimming with dolphins and then everything will be fine . . . . This has to go back to being a happy home . & rsquo ; & rdquo;Now , having a special-needs daughter is an important part of who she is , but not her full identity . & ldquo;I am connected to Yael , & rdquo ; she said . & ldquo;I will always need to be there for her . But I&rsquo;m also a writer , I&rsquo;m also Lior&rsquo;s mother and Yair&rsquo;s wife . I&rsquo;m also a friend . & rdquo;It was interesting for her to write the sections about Nina and Irena&rsquo;s relationship , because her relationship with her daughter is very different . & ldquo;I have a daughter I can&rsquo;t fight with the way Irena and Nina fight in the book . & rdquo ; & nbsp;One aspect of the response to her book in Israel that has pleased her is that , & ldquo;People have said , it&rsquo;s so Israeli . & rdquo ; Now that it has been published in English , she isn&rsquo;t afraid that readers in other countries will find it too Israeli and won&rsquo;t be able to relate to it . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s like reading a book from abroad , a book like The Kite Runner , and it&rsquo;s wonderful that it gives you an authentic glimpse into another world , a window into the life of someone completely different . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Just before heading off to the rally , she said that since October 7 , she felt that the story of the bereaved mother in the novel was even more relevant . & ldquo;Every time I see a picture of a soldier who has been killed , I think , there&rsquo;s another mother like Carmela now , who will miss him for 30 or 40 years , who won&rsquo;t be able to feel happy for 30 or 40 years . & nbsp;They are soldiers , but they are also our children . . . . Now that the book is being published in English , I think people who read it outside of Israel will have a greater understanding of what it means to be Israeli , of the price we pay for our life here , that&rsquo;s very meaningful to me . & rdquo ;",lihi lapid's novel ‘ on her own ’

2024-03-20 02:37:21.257,jpost,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Joe Biden spoke on the phone Monday for the first time in over a month as tensions between the two leaders continue to increase.The conversation focused on Israel&rsquo;s war against Hamas . The campaign , which is now in its sixth month , has driven a wedge between the longtime allies that some are calling unprecedented . While the relationship between the US and Israel has been dotted with disagreements and crises , the alliance has largely been considered steadfast and unwavering.Tensions between President Biden and Netanyahu were evident even before the war , as the Israeli government sought to promote a widespread reform of the country&rsquo;s judicial system . While Netanyahu insisted that the reform would make Israel even more democratic , the US voiced its concerns that the overhaul would concentrate power in Israel&rsquo;s executive branch . The White House also criticized the inclusion of several far-right ultranationalist cabinet ministers in the Netanyahu government.Immediate support after Oct . 7 , but is now it dwindling?Following Hamas&rsquo ; surprise offensive against Israel , during which approximately 1,200 people were killed , President Biden set aside his differences with Netanyahu and moved to show immediate support for the Jewish state . In a visit to Tel Aviv just days after the attack , the American leader expressed solidarity with the Israeli people and vowed to continue the steady supply of arms to Israel . The US also mobilized aircraft carriers to the region to deter Israel&rsquo;s other foes , mainly Iran , from joining the war.As the war continued , the US raised more questions about Israel&rsquo;s tactics and end-game strategy . Israel&rsquo;s offensive in Gaza has led to high casualties , with Gaza&rsquo;s Hamas-run Health Ministry reporting over 31,000 Palestinians killed and 73,000 injured . The offensive has led to widespread destruction in the territory that will cost billions of dollars to repair . Various international organizations have also warned of famine in Gaza , upping the pressure on Israel to halt its offensive.In the past weeks , the tone adopted by senior American officials toward Israel&rsquo;s leaders has escalated . Earlier this year , the American president was reported to have called Netanyahu a & ldquo;bad f * * * ing guy , & rdquo ; which he denied having said . But last week , he went on the record saying the Israeli leader was causing more harm than good to his country . & ldquo;This is a unique crisis , both because it is in the midst of a war and because of what appears to be its very personal nature , & rdquo ; Dr . Shay Har-Zvi , head of the International and Middle Eastern Arenas at Reichman University&rsquo;s Institute for Policy and Strategy , told The Media Line . & ldquo;The personal criticism , rather than criticism of policy , makes this crisis exceptional and perhaps one of the most acute . & rdquo;The main point of contention is a pending Israeli military operation in Rafah , a city in the southern Gaza Strip . According to the United Nations , a majority of the approximately 1.7 million Palestinians displaced by the war are taking shelter in Rafah . Rafah is the only city in Gaza that has not yet seen an operation of Israeli ground troops.As Israel delays its operation in Rafah , international pressure against operating in the city has grown . Many countries are warning of an exacerbated humanitarian crisis in Rafah , prompting Israel to consider how best to handle the city&rsquo;s civilian population.Netanyahu has vowed to operate in Rafah , saying that Hamas&rsquo ; senior leadership is hiding there . The city is also home to an extensive underground tunnel network that is believed to cross into neighboring Egypt . The tunnels are Hamas&rsquo ; main lifeline and source of weapons , making the target a critical one in Israel&rsquo;s mission to dismantle the terrorist organization&rsquo;s military capabilities . & ldquo;The US feels Israel is not doing enough to meet the humanitarian needs in Gaza and they want answers about how Israel intends to deal with the civilian presence in Rafah , & rdquo ; Har-Zvi said . & ldquo;The humanitarian issue is at the core of the disagreement . & rdquo;According to a White House readout of the call between the two leaders , Netanyahu agreed to send a delegation to the US to & ldquo;exchange views and discuss alternative approaches that would target key elements of Hamas and secure the Egypt-Gaza border without a major ground operation in Rafah . & rdquo ; & ldquo;The American perception is that because of Netanyahu&rsquo;s political considerations , he is rejecting any possible solution , & rdquo ; Har-Zvi added . & ldquo;He is not only missing what could be a historic opportunity , but also strategically entangling Israel by increasing the risk of a wider conflict and this will directly hurt American strategic interests . & rdquo;Tensions on Israel&rsquo;s northern border have also escalated , threatening to widen the scope of the conflict . These developments have the White House increasingly on edge.Negotiations for a truce and a deal that would see the Israeli hostages being held by Hamas released could have a calming effect on the region . Those talks are currently underway in Qatar . & ldquo;The US government is concerned that the failure of these talks will mean a regional escalation , & rdquo ; Har-Zvi said . & ldquo;There is an understanding within the administration that the region is now at a critical crossroads . & rdquo;During last month&rsquo;s Democratic primary in Michigan , in which the incumbent president was running uncontested , 13 % of voters voted & ldquo;uncommitted&rdquo ; as part of a movement to protest his handling of the Israel-Gaza war . That result signaled to the White House that its Gaza policy was putting the president at risk . & ldquo;In the beginning of the war , Biden was willing to pay the price for his support for Israel , but now the uncommitted votes appear to be gaining momentum and will likely influence Biden , & rdquo ; Har-Zvi explained.Over the weekend , Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer sharply criticized Netanyahu and called for early elections in Israel . Schumer was criticized both by Israelis and by US Republicans for interfering in internal Israeli affairs . The president praised the majority leader&rsquo;s speech , further upsetting Netanyahu.Although the current tensions between Israel and the US have been called unprecedented , the two countries have faced rocky periods before . & ldquo;There is a tendency to see crises as & lsquo;the worst&rsquo ; in the heat of the moment , & rdquo ; Zalman Shoval , a former Israeli ambassador to the US , told The Media Line.He said there have been & ldquo;far worse&rdquo ; crises than what Israel and the US are currently facing.In the aftermath of the 1973 Yom Kippur War , Israel and the US faced disagreements about how to prevent future conflict between Israel and Egypt . As a result of the disagreements , the US & ldquo;reassessed&rdquo ; its relations with Israel and froze arms deliveries to the country , leading to great tension between the allies . Israel later went on to sign a disengagement agreement with Egypt , likely due to American pressure.In the early 1990s , President George H.W . Bush announced that the US would withhold loan guarantees to Israel until it stopped building settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.Both crises appeared unprecedented and , to some , insurmountable.Israeli and American society have both changed significantly since the time of those crises . The Israeli public has increasingly shifted to the right , with consistently less support for a negotiated solution that would see the establishment of a Palestinian state . The Democratic Party has also changed in recent years , with a growing progressive element that shows more support for the Palestinians . & ldquo;These changes must not be underestimated , & rdquo ; Shoval said . & ldquo;The political future of both countries is unclear . & rdquo;This future depends very much on the fate of the American and Israeli leaders . President Biden is in the midst of an election campaign set to culminate in November 2024 . Netanyahu is lagging in the polls , and his increasingly unpopular government is not expected to last until the scheduled 2026 elections . The outcomes of elections in both countries will impact how the crisis plays out . & ldquo;The question is whether the US will continue to see itself as the leader of the Western world or if isolationist tendencies will grow , & rdquo ; Shoval said.He added that personal chemistry between the two leaders is not as significant a factor as many believe . Israel and the US still have mutual interests , and the countries will eventually overcome the current crisis , Shoval said . & ldquo;American defense support for Israel also stems from its own interests , including financial ones , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;Unless there will be a fundamental shift in the US , this cooperation will continue . & rdquo;Israel spends billions of dollars every year on American weapons systems , military equipment , and services.The US appears eager to end the war , despite its stated support for Israel&rsquo;s goal of dismantling Hamas . Public opinion in Israel , on the other hand , is very much in favor of continuing the war effort . This trend is evident in many polls and is independent of Netanyahu&rsquo;s declining popularity . & ldquo;When Americans come to express reservations about Netanyahu , they need to remember that there is overwhelming support in Israel for the war , & rdquo ; Shoval said . & ldquo;I am not sure they understand the basic factors in the domestic politics here . & rdquo ;","us-israel relations tested as gap between president biden , netanyahu widens - analysis"

The Israeli government held is fully and directly responsible for the escalation . & rdquo;Abbas Zaki , a member of the Central Committee of the ruling Fatah faction , also warned that Israel&rsquo;s actions would lead to a & ldquo;mass popular explosion . & rdquo ; & ldquo;The crimes committed by the occupation authorities and the settlers against our people threaten to ignite the region with more violence , & rdquo ; Zaki cautioned.He called on the international community and its human rights institutions to intervene & ldquo;to put an end to the shedding of Palestinian blood and the continuation of the crimes of the occupation authorities against our people and their Islamic and Arab lands and holy sites . & rdquo;Zaki said that Israel would bear full responsibility for the repercussions of its actions.Tayseer Khaled , another senior PLO official , claimed that Israel was in a & ldquo;state of confusion&rdquo ; because of the security deterioration in the West Bank . & ldquo;In the past few months , the occupation army has launched campaigns of raids and arrests in various parts of the West Bank , focusing on Nablus and Jenin . Why ? Because the West Bank , including Jerusalem , is where local resistance cells operate . These cells are organized by Palestinian youth of the post-Second Intifada generation , & rdquo ; Khaled said . & ldquo;This generation has become the most prominent challenge to the occupation . It&rsquo;s a courageous and fearless generation that has lost confidence in any political process and has become more convinced that armed resistance is the most appropriate way to confront the occupation and settlements . & rdquo;Khaled also warned of an & ldquo;explosion&rdquo ; in the West Bank if Israel continues to deal with the situation there only as a security problem . He ruled out the possibility that Israeli attempts to strengthen the PA would contribute to easing the tensions.Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad , meanwhile , renewed their calls to Palestinians to step up their attacks against IDF soldiers and settlers in the West Bank.The two groups said in separate statements in response to the death of Palestinian gunman Hamad Abu Jildeh & ndash ; who died early Sunday of wounds he sustained during clashes with IDF troops in Jenin last week & ndash ; that his killing wouldn&rsquo;t stop the Palestinians from continuing the & ldquo;resistance . & rdquo ; & ldquo;The battle waged by our Palestinian people and their resistance against the criminal occupation continues unabated , and that the blood of the martyrs will not be in vain , & rdquo ; Hamas said.Islamic Jihad , for its part , said it would & ldquo;continue to follow the path of martyrs , regardless of the sacrifices , until the end of the occupation . & rdquo ;",palestinian authority : we haven’t lost control ; israel caused escalation

2021-06-22 19:55:32.610,jpost,"There are large gaps in trust between Israelis , Palestinians and Arab-Israelis across Israel and the Palestinian territories , according to a recent survey by Tel Aviv University ( TAU ) . & quot;Unsurprisingly , the Jewish public expressed very high levels of distrust towards the Palestinians in Gaza ( 85 % ) and on the West Bank ( 84 % ) , & quot ; TAU said in its report . & quot;But still , these are a bit lower than the level of total distrust of Hamas ( 97 % ) . Among respondents in the Jewish public , there is also distrust of Arabs who are citizens of Israel , except among left-wingers , as three-quarters of them expressed trust in Arab citizens of Israel . & quot ; In comparison , mistrust of Palestinians and Arab-Israelis by the Jewish public is at & quot;higher levels&quot ; than that of the Arab public @ @ @ s perception of the Jewish public , which is reported to be at more & quot;moderate&quot ; levels . While the majority of respondents relayed their willingness to close said gap , by strengthening equality and cooperation between the sides , Jewish respondents feel a need to strengthen & quot;Jewish control&quot ; over the region following the most recent escalation and civil unrest that plagued the country in May & mdash ; Although that notion had low support from the left-wing Israeli supporters . Arab-Israeli respondents showed clear support ( 75 % ) for increasing equality among the Jewish and Arab groups . & quot;In contrast , the Arab public expressed more ambivalence regarding their level of trust for all three of the groups mentioned , but among those who expressed opinions , a majority ( 61 % ) expressed distrust of Jewish citizens of Israel , & quot ; TAU explained . Zoning in on relations between the two opposing groups , a larger majority of the Jewish public are for further coordination with Arab-Israeli citizens and Palestinians alike & mdash ; except those who stand in right-wing camps , who held split opinions on such a step . Arab-Israeli respondents additionally expressed their support ( 71 % ) for further cooperation between the groups and an opposition to separating the groups , although stood divided on policies that would increase Israeli control across the region . & quot;Most of the left and center ( 95 % and 83 % respectively ) support increased equality for the two groups , while half of the moderate right-wing support such moves , & quot ; TAU said . & quot;Among the right-wing , only 28 % expressed support . & quot;Similar data appear for the four ideological Jewish groups , regarding the level of opposition to an increase in separation between Arabs and Jews ( 85 % , 65 % , 55 % , and 27 % respectively ) . & quot ; With regard to the widespread civil unrest that plagued the country during the most recent IDF operation in the Gaza Strip , half of the Israeli public was under the belief that former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu failed to deal with the violence properly , nor did they believe the violence was justified but instead instigated by Palestinians and Arab-Israelis holding positions of influence across the region , while the Arab public believed Netanyahu fueled the strife . Right-wing ( 81 % ) and moderate right-wing ( 74 % ) Israeli supporters both shared the belief that Netanyahu did not want to exacerbate the recent civil unrest that stormed through the mixed-cities across the country , while left-wing supporters ( 82 % ) and centrists ( 69 % ) thought the exact opposite & mdash ; displaying the mirror image of both camps with regard to the former prime minister . Similarly , although displaying further gaps in opinions , right-wing camps believed Netanyahu did well to quell the violence while left-wing Israelis in greater majorities believed that he aggravated the situation . The general Arab public tended to hold similar views with the left-wing camps across Israel , that instead of stamping out the violence , Netanyahu incited it to further the operation in Gaza . Both Arab and Jewish sectors did , however , agree that the violence was unjustified and only furthered the divide between the two sides . When asked about the IDF @ @ @ s Operation Guardian of the Wall , around half of the Jewish public believes Israel & quot;achieved more significant gains than Hamas in the recent fighting . & quot ; This is despite the feeling that the world perceives the operation as being of a&nbsp ; & quot;disproportionate nature . & quot ; A larger majority supports further military operations to bring the total collapse of Hamas in the Gaza Strip or long-term solution to the ongoing conflict . & quot;Most of the Arab public support a long-term solution ( 57 % ) , but a third did not express their opinion , & quot ; TAU said . The most common answer given , however , across the Arab sector was that they & quot;did not know&quot ; who gained the upper hand in the fighting , and with regard to international opinion surrounding how the conflict played out , they are evenly divided on how the world views Israel in the aftermath of the violence believing that many countries still support the Jewish State regardless . In the context of future negotiations and peace arrangements with the Palestinians , there has been some opposition to & quot;maintaining the present situation in comparison to previous surveys , & quot ; with many reconsidering their positions on the decades-long conflict , meaning that while a larger portion of the public prefer a one-state solution , the majority still supports a two-state & mdash ; as well as additional considerations regarding annexation and a binational coexistence . & quot;Among the respondents , most on the left ( 55 % ) and on the right ( 53 % ) responded that it had not led to reconsideration , while among the moderate right and the center , most answered positively , & quot ; said TAU in its report . & quot;People on the right who responded that they were reconsidering their opinions were divided between those who said that they were weighing whether to support a military solution ( 33 % ) and those who stated that they were thinking about supporting an agreed upon political solution ( 16 % ) . & quot ; Centrists responded more commonly to a political solution ( 37 % ) , and in contrast , about a third of the Arab public did not respond , while about a quarter said they would consider & quot;supporting an agreed upon political solution . & quot ; & quot;Despite the growing dissatisfaction with the existing situation , there is no sign of change , when compared to the previous index , in answers to the question of which solution has the highest probability of being achieved , as in the last index , continuing the present situation is the most frequent reply in the sample ( 46 % ) , & quot ; TAU explained . Noting the new unity government headed by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Foreign Minister Yair Lapid , which is without a leader currently on trial for public corruption ( i.e . Netanyahu ) , two-thirds of the respondents to the survey are categorically for a law that would prevent those accused of a criminal act from serving as prime minister . & quot;The data received indicates stability , when contrasted to the previous index , in support of a law to prevent those accused of criminal activity from serving as prime minister ( 66 % in contrast to 65 % ) , including broad support among right-wing voters ( 69 % ) , & quot ; TAU noted . & quot;Netanyahu&rsquo;s proposal for direct elections for prime minister also gains wide support among the right-wing ( 87 % ) and from the moderate right ( 71 % ) , compared to opposition from the centrists ( 63 % ) and from the left-wing ( 82 % ) . & quot ;","large gaps in trust between israelis , palestinians and arab-israelis"

2024-06-16 15:03:04.017,jpost,"The Israel Antiquities Authority ( IAA ) and the Lod Municipality discovered them by chance during excavations of a destroyed Jewish public building . Experts said they were evidence of the last Jewish revolt against Roman rule in Israel & ndash ; 1,650 years ago.The dramatic discovery is the first-ever evidence in Lod of the Gallus Revolt , the last Jewish resistance against Roman rule , between 351 and 354 CE.The excavation was carried out on Nordau Street in the building from the late Roman-early Byzantine period that suffered violent destruction . Presumably , the coins , dating from 221 to 354 CE , were deliberately placed there in the hopes that the owner would return to collect them when the situation calmed down.There is very little written evidence about the Gallus Revolt . However , texts indicate that the forces of Roman Caesar Flavius Constantinus Gallus destroyed major Jewish communities such as Lod , Zipori , and Tiberias.Among the various finds in the building were impressive stone and marble artifacts , along with Greek , Hebrew , and Latin inscriptions , including one bearing the name of a Jewish man from a priestly family , which is still under examination.These inscriptions , coupled with the complete absence of pig bones from the bone assemblage uncovered on the site , attest to this building&rsquo;s association with the Jewish community . ' An exciting , very emotionally moving find ' & nbsp;According to IAA site excavators Shahar Krispin and Mor Viezel , & ldquo;In all likelihood , this is a magnificent Jewish building that housed the city&rsquo;s elders . From Talmudic writings , we know that Lod was a most significant Jewish center in the aftermath of the Second Temple&rsquo;s destruction in Jerusalem . Some of the renowned & lsquo;Sages of Lod&rsquo ; are Rabbi Eliezer ben Horkanos , Rabbi Tarfon , Rabbi Akiva , Rabbi Yosi Ha&rsquo;Galili , and many more . & ldquo;The building , destroyed down to its very foundations , is a clear indication that the revolt was forcefully put down with violence and cruelty and was not simply a local uprising event , as some earlier studies contended . This is the singular witness , thus far , to the extent and power of this revolt in Lod , which is located in the country&rsquo;s center . & rdquo;IAA council head Prof . Joshua Schwartz , who studies Talmudic-period Lod , noted that & ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard to know if this magnificent building served as synagogue , study hall , meeting hall of the elders , or all three of these functions as one.But what is clear is that the building&rsquo;s size , the coin hoard , and the assemblage of archaeological finds produced by the excavation fit well Lod/Diospolis&rsquo;s description , in both Jewish and non-Jewish sources , as a center of Torah-true Jewish life in the Mishna and Talmud periods . Lod&rsquo;s role as a leading community with elders continued from after the destruction through to this moment , when it was cruelly cut down in the Gallus Revolt . & rdquo;IAA director Eli Escuzido concluded that & ldquo;the impressive finds uncovered here reinforce our responsibility to investigate and to conserve Lod&rsquo;s history and rich heritage . Along with the city&rsquo;s new exhibition center of the beautiful Lod mosaic , we now bring this building to the awareness of the general public . & rdquo;Lod Mayor Yair Revivo added that & ldquo;this is an exciting and very emotionally moving find , another link in the chain of Lod&rsquo;s Tannaitic period heritage as host to the authors of the Mishna and Lod&rsquo;s Jewish history . The finds in the area prove that Lod is one of the oldest cities in the world . We wish to thank the IAA for revealing our city&rsquo;s past glory . I believe that now that it is uncovered , this site will bring many tourists and visitors to the city . Lod is connecting to its past and is looking forward to a bright future . & rdquo;The findings will be published as part of the Central Israel Region Archaeological Conference , which will be held at Tel Aviv&rsquo;s Eretz Yisrael Museum on June 20 and jointly hosted by Tel Aviv University , Bar-Ilan University , and the ( IAA ) .

The updated 2024 budget that passed into law in March set the budget deficit ceiling at 6.6 % , but by the end of April already reached 7 % . Committee chairman MK Moshe Gafni ( United Torah Judaism ) held the session after nine committee members , all from the opposition , demanded he address the issue.Yesh Atid MK Vladimir Beliak , the coordinator of the opposition in the committee , pointed out at the beginning of the session that he had warned during the budget debates in March of this scenario , and criticized the government for rejecting steps to decrease its expenditures , such as closing down ministries or reducing the amount of & ldquo;coalition funds&rdquo ; which Beliak claimed were reserved for political purposes . & ldquo;I want to know , what deficit will we reach ? I have not heard from the finance minister [ Bezalel Smotrich ] & hellip ; If we arrive at a double-digit deficit , what will the repercussions be vis - & agrave ; - vis the credit rating companies ? What will the repercussions be on the social services that the state can provide ? & rdquo ; Beliak said.The deficit applies to the past 12 months , and the representative from the finance ministry&rsquo;s budget department , Asaf Wexler , argued that the deficit will shrink back to within the 6.6 % limit by year&rsquo;s end . According to Wexler , the sharp increase in the deficit reflected months of intense fighting and economic slowdown.It also reflected the & ldquo;situation of very high uncertainty&rdquo ; as to when the fighting will end , and consequently to Israel&rsquo;s economic performance . Wexler admitted , however , that if a war breaks out in Israel&rsquo;s north , the finance ministry would likely need to update its deficit forecast.MKs criticized other aspects of the government's performanceDuring the session , both Beliak and Labor MK Naama Lazimi criticized other aspects of the government&rsquo;s performance on the economy . These included breaking 2023&rsquo;s deficit ceiling despite updating the 2023 budget in December ; the downgrade of Israel&rsquo;s credit rating by both S&amp;P and Moodys ; the fact that Gafni , who is ultra-Orthodox ( haredi ) , has refused to pass several provisions laid out in the budget to increase government income , to protest the withholding of funds he claims have not been given to the haredi school system ; the uptick in the cost of living and inflation remaining high at 2.8 % ; and other aspects.The session also came a day after the finance ministry published an updated version of what is known as the & ldquo;numerator , & rdquo ; which computes expected government spending three years ahead . According to the numerator , the government has already committed to spending billions more in the upcoming years than it is allowed to do by law . For example , the government has already committed to spending NIS 600 billion in 2025 , higher than the legal limit of NIS 545 billion ; and it committed to spend NIS 615 billion in 2026 , despite a limit of NIS 569.8 billion.The result is that ahead of the 2025 budget , the state will either need to reduce its spending , which could affect its ability to provide services ; or raise taxes . & nbsp ;","budget deficit could pass 10 % at years end , opposition mks warn"

2024-04-15 13:09:56.743,jpost,"The current US administration is & ldquo;appalled&rdquo ; by the conduct of Israel&rsquo;s government , opposition leader MK Yair Lapid said in a press conference on Monday ahead of a meeting of his Yesh Atid party , after returning from a week-long visit to Washington . & ldquo;This government , this prime minister , has become an existential threat against Israel , & rdquo ; Lapid said . They destroyed Israeli deterrence . Our enemies look at this government , smell weakness , and raise their heads , & rdquo ; Lapid said . & ldquo;Our allies also smell this weakness . I was in Washington last week , in a meeting with top administration officials . They are appalled by this government : irresponsibility , the lack of professionalism , the failed management , the ingratitude , & rdquo ; Lapid said.Lapid argued that the legacy of Netanyahu , who called himself & ldquo;Mr . Security&rdquo ; in the past , was a & ldquo;wasteland from Kiryat Shmona to Be&rsquo;eri , violence by Jewish settlers that is out of hand , and a complete loss of Israeli deterrence . & rdquo ; He added that Netanyahu was delaying an agreement with Hamas to return its hostages.כל מה שנשאר מ״מר בטחון ״ זה עיי חורבות מבארי עד קרית שמונה , אלימות של טרוריסטים יהודים שיצאו משליטה , ואובדן גמור של ההרתעה הישראלית.אם לא נזיז את הממשלה הזו בזמן , היא תביא עלינו חורבן . היא כבר מביאה . הגיע הזמן לבחירות , עכשיו . & mdash ; יאיר לפיד - Yair Lapid ( @ yairlapid ) April 15 , 2024""Our problem is Iran , but our problem is also here & hellip ; it is time for an election now , "" Lapid concluded.Likud fires backThe Likud responded in a statement : & ldquo;Lapid , who signed an embarrassing surrender agreement with Hezbollah , and preferred to remain abroad this week while Israel was attacked , is not the person to preach . Prime Minister Netanyahu , who identified the Iranian threat already dozens of years ago , since then has led a global campaign against it , to prevent its obtaining nuclear weapons that would have been an existential threat against Israel . & rdquo;Lapid responded with a statement of his own : & ldquo;Israeli deterrence in Lebanon collapsed when Netanyahu enabled Hezbollah to build two tents in the sovereign territory of the State of Israel , as opposed to Lapid , who cut the maritime [ border ] agreement despite Hezbollah&rsquo;s opposition . & ldquo;Regarding Iran : If Netanyahu worked all these years on the Iranian issue , how have they become a nuclear threshold state , and sent hundreds of drones and cruise missiles to attack the State of Israel ? & rdquo;Later on Monday , Lapid called in the Knesset plenum for minister MK Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot to leave the government . Gantz and Eisenkot joined the government on October 11 and are members of Israel&rsquo;s war cabinet , but have vowed to leave the government once they feel that they no longer influence the war . Lapid argued in his speech that & ldquo;every time we are presented with a new proposal of theirs in the cabinet but no one listens to them , & rdquo ; and that the way to have true influence was to replace the current government with a new one . & nbsp ;","us administration ' appalled ' by israeli government , lapid says"

2022-02-03 16:02:08.767,jpost,"Former US president Donald Trump already believed at the beginning of his administration that prime minister&nbsp ; Benjamin Netanyahu did not want peace with the Palestinians , former US ambassador to Israel David Friedman reveals in his soon-to-be-released book , Sledgehammer . Friedman describes in the book & ndash ; set to be released on February 9 & ndash ; how he and Trump&rsquo;s Middle East envoy at the time , Jason Greenblatt , tipped off Netanyahu and worked together to disabuse Trump of that notion . The ambassador describes a & ldquo;brilliant move&rdquo ; by the Palestinians ahead of Trump&rsquo;s visit to the region in May 2017 , in which they had & ldquo;a respected businessman , major philanthropist and active player in the region , & rdquo ; and a Trump supporter , speak to the president on the topic . That person is Ron Lauder , who once supported Netanyahu but had a falling out with him , though Friedman does not name him in the book . Lauder told Trump that the Palestinians & ldquo;were prepared to make peace with Israel on very favorable terms , even to include conceding all of Jerusalem to Israeli sovereignty and giving up the return of refugees , but the problem was that Bibi Netanyahu was unwilling to negotiate peace . The surrogate informed the president that he needed to pressure Netanyahu and embrace Abbas in order to make a deal . Trump bought it . . . He was going to put the screws to Netanyahu to force a deal . & rdquo ; Knowing that Abbas would never consider such a deal that Lauder claimed , Greenblatt called Friedman , and they agreed that Netanyahu should be warned that the Palestinians had manipulated Trump . Netanyahu was & ldquo;very agitated&rdquo ; by the call , and called Friedman for a meeting . The ambassador suggested that the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office prepare a video that would reveal Abbas&rsquo;s & ldquo;true colors . & rdquo ; Contrary to what journalist Bob Woodward reported in his book Rage & ndash ; that Netanyahu showed Trump a doctored video & ndash ; Friedman writes : & ldquo;I emphasized that this needed to be completely honest & ndash ; nothing out of context and nothing subject to multiple interpretations . & rdquo ; In Trump&rsquo;s first meeting in Israel with then-president Reuven Rivlin , he said , & ldquo;He understood that Abbas was desperate to do a peace deal , the prime minister of Israel was unwilling . & rdquo ; Friedman , Greenblatt and the others were worried that Trump&rsquo;s remarks would be leaked to the press & ndash ; perhaps in light of Rivlin&rsquo;s contentious relationship with Netanyahu & ndash ; but they were not . Trump then met one-on-one with Netanyahu , and 45 minutes later , aides entered the room . The leaders discussed Israel&rsquo;s security , and Friedman suggested that they watch the video of Abbas&rsquo;s speeches . & ldquo;With that we watched two minutes of Abbas honoring terrorists , extolling violence , and vowing to never accept anything less than Israel&rsquo;s total defeat , & rdquo ; Friedman recounted . & ldquo;Abbas ranted that the blood of every shaheed & ndash ; literally a martyr but also a terrorist & ndash ; was holy and would be avenged . & rdquo ; Friedman did not say the video included what Woodward&rsquo;s book said , that it & ldquo;sounded like Abbas was ordering the murder of children . & rdquo ; After watching the video , Trump said , & ldquo;Wow , is that the same guy I met in Washington last month ? He seemed like such a sweet , peaceful guy . & rdquo ; LATER IN the trip , when Trump met with Abbas in Bethlehem , he & ldquo;laced into Abbas over the tape , demanding to know who he really was , a peacemaker as he claimed in Washington or a terrorist as he proclaimed on the tape . & rdquo ; Friedman also reported that Abbas complained about Israeli security in the West Bank . & ldquo;Trump asked him how much Israel was charging the PA for those security services , & rdquo ; the ambassador wrote . & ldquo;Abbas looked stunned . He replied that Israel was performing those services at no cost to the Palestinians . & rdquo ; The book continues : & ldquo;The president jumped on this admission . He observed that the Palestinians live in a very dangerous part of the world and have virtually no ability to defend themselves . . . He was incredulous that Abbas was rejecting free Israeli security support when Israel was the only player in the region that knew how to fight these implacable foes . & ldquo;Abbas looked at Trump as if he had two heads & ndash ; no one had ever spoken to him before with this brutal clarity , & rdquo ; Friedman recalled . One of the recurring motifs of Sledgehammer , a memoir of Friedman&rsquo;s time as ambassador and relationship with Trump , is the envoy butting heads with the establishment . He repeatedly clashed with former secretary of state Rex Tillerson , one of which was about the video Friedman suggested that Netanyahu show Trump . Tillerson and then-national security adviser H.R . McMaster were & ldquo;livid&rdquo ; and thought it was a & ldquo;cheap propaganda trick . & rdquo ; & ldquo;I work for the president , nobody else , & rdquo ; Friedman said he told the officials . & ldquo;He had been given bad information . Frankly , I&rsquo;m surprised you didn&rsquo;t know about it . I am going to make sure that he is well informed so that he gets Israel policy right . And I will keep doing that as long as I have this job , and even after I don&rsquo;t . & rdquo ; Trump did not seem to see a problem with Friedman&rsquo;s approach . At the end of the president&rsquo;s trip to Israel , he wrote Friedman a letter commending the & ldquo;tremendous job&rdquo ; he did , and that he & ldquo;will be able to help us negotiate the ultimate deal . & rdquo ; Trump reverted back to his pre-video-viewing opinion of Netanyahu in recent years . Friedman told this week&rsquo;s Jerusalem Post&nbsp;Podcast that Trump was unhappy with Netanyahu&rsquo;s speech at the White House in 2020 , when Trump presented his peace plan for the Israelis and Palestinians . Trump felt Netanyahu&rsquo;s remarks sounded too much like an election speech , and Netanyahu was too hasty in pushing for sovereignty in Judea and Samaria , Friedman recounted . Speaking to Israeli journalist Barak Ravid in early 2021 , Trump said , & ldquo;I thought the Palestinians were impossible , and the Israelis would do anything to make peace and a deal . I found that not to be true . & ldquo;Bibi did not want to make a deal , & rdquo ; he stated . & ldquo;I wish he would have said he didn&rsquo;t want to make a deal . . . because a lot of people devoted a lot of work . But I don&rsquo;t think Bibi would have ever made a deal . & rdquo ; Abbas , Trump posited , & ldquo;wanted to make a deal more than Netanyahu . . . We spent a lot of time together , talking about many things . And it was almost like a father . I mean , he was so nice , couldn&rsquo;t have been nicer . & rdquo ;","how netanyahu , friedman convinced trump that abbas doesn’t want peace"

( Ret . ) Uzi Dayan , chairman of the Jordan Valley Trustees Association , emphasized the importance of preserving historical sites such as the Jordan River crossings and highlighted their profound significance in connecting the Jewish people to the Land of Israel . & ldquo;The site symbolizes the deep and historical connection of the Jewish people to the Land of Israel , & rdquo ; Dayan stated , advocating for an annual state ceremony to commemorate the Israelites&rsquo ; crossing.The event drew participation from hundreds of individuals across the country who engaged in various activities , including a musical prayer service , guided tours in the Jericho area , and a symposium discussing the historical and cultural significance of the Jordan River crossings.Collaborating with regional councils in the Jordan Valley and receiving support from organizations such as Magen David Adom , the Aliyah and Integration Ministry , the World Zionist Organization , and the Jordan Valley Trustees Association highlighted the potential for developing tourism in the region.Dayan noted that the site attracts over 850,000 tourists annually and proposed the construction of hotels and visitor centers to accommodate the growing interest , which could provide employment opportunities for residents and further establish Israel&rsquo;s presence in the Jordan Valley.The Jordan River crossing is a cornerstone moment for the Israeli peopleAccording to biblical accounts and historical research , the crossing of the Jordan River by the Hebrews or Israelites is a pivotal moment in their journey to claim the Promised Land . As recounted in the Book of Joshua , after wandering in the wilderness for forty years , the Israelites , led by Joshua , stood on the eastern bank of the Jordan River , poised to enter the land of Canaan.Mirroring the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea led by Moses , Joshua ordered the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant to step into the waters of the Jordan . As they did , the river miraculously parted , allowing the Israelites to cross on dry ground , just as the slave generation had done 40 years earlier . This event symbolized the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promise to deliver the land to the Israelites and marked the beginning of their conquest and settlement of Canaan.Historical research corroborates elements of this biblical account , suggesting that the crossing of the Jordan River likely occurred at a shallow ford near the modern-day site of Kasser Al-Yahud . Archaeological evidence and geographical studies support the plausibility of such an event , with scholars proposing that the timing of the crossing coincided with the spring thaw when the river&rsquo;s waters would have been at their lowest .","israelis commemorate bible's jordan river crossing 3,300 years ago"
2022-06-20 16:19:57.787,jpost,"Kamal Lahlouh , the father of one of the three Palestinian gunmen who were killed during clashes with IDF troops in Jenin last week , has held the Palestinian Authority security forces responsible for the killing of his son.The accusation came amid growing discontent among Palestinians in the Jenin area in particular and the West Bank in general with the ongoing security coordination between the PA security forces and the IDF.Several Palestinian activists claimed over the past few days that Israel and the PA were working together to eliminate scores of gunmen in the Jenin area.On the other hand , a growing number of Palestinians continued to criticize the PA security forces for failing to engage IDF soldiers who enter Palestinian cities to carry out arrests and seize illegal weapons.A public opinion poll published earlier this year by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found that 64 % of the Palestinians want the PA security forces to confront the Israeli forces when they enter Palestinian cities.Another 61 % said they supported ending the security coordination.The incidentBara&rsquo ; Lahlouh , 24 , and two of his friends , Yusef Salah , 23 , and Laith Abu Srour , 24 , were killed last Friday morning during an exchange of gunfire with IDF soldiers in Jenin.Lahlouh&rsquo;s father claimed that his son belonged to Palestinian Islamic Jihad&rsquo;s armed wing , Al-Quds Brigades . & nbsp;Other sources , however , said that the slain gunman was a senior commander of Hamas&rsquo;s military wing , Izaddin al-Qassam.After the incident , many Palestinians renewed their call to the PA to end the security coordination with Israel , dubbing it an act of treason.In recent years , the PA has repeatedly ignored requests to end the security coordination with Israel.Earlier this year , the Palestinian Central Council , a key decision-making PLO institution , again voted in favor of halting the security coordination . The resolution , however , has since been ignored by the PA leadership in Ramallah . Similar resolutions taken by the council over the past few years were also ignored.But in 2020 the PA briefly halted the coordination in protest of Israel&rsquo;s since-shelved plan to extend its sovereignty to Jewish communities in the West Bank.In an interview with local reporters , Lahlouh&rsquo;s father , Kamal , said that he holds the PA&rsquo;s Preventive Security Service ( PSS ) responsible for the killing of his son.والد الشهيد تورط واضح لجهاز أمن وقائي سلطة فتح بإغتيال الشاب براء لحلوح في جنين pic.twitter.com/z9aD7nkaGj&mdash ; Raed Ali 𓂆 🇵 🇸 ( @ RaedAli73 ) June 17 , 2022Noting that his son , Bara&rsquo ; , had been previously arrested and interrogated by the PSS , the father claimed that a transcript of the interrogation was later transferred to the Israeli security forces.According to the father , when he was recently summoned for questioning by an Israeli Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) security officer , he discovered that the same file prepared by the PSS was in the hands of Israel . & ldquo;The Preventive Security Service destroyed my son , & rdquo ; he charged . & ldquo;My son chose the path of martyrdom , and I told him that I respect his decision .

Despite the enormous efforts of the Egyptian and Palestinian Red Crescent Societies , UN agencies , and other partners , the use of only the Rafah crossing - meant for pedestrians - to bring in trucks of goods does not work . & ldquo;What we see today are shelters with no capacity , a health system on its knees , a lack of clean drinking water , no proper sanitation , and poor nutrition for people already mentally and physically exhausted : a textbook formula for epidemics and a public health disaster , & rdquo ; she said.The head of the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross , visited Gaza on Monday , issuing a statement in which she said the level of human suffering was intolerable , called for the protection of civilians , respect for the laws of war , and the release of hostages held by Hamas . "" We would welcome Hamas laying down its arms""In Washington , State Department spokesman Matthew Miller defended the resumption of Israel&rsquo;s military campaign to oust Hamas from Gaza that began after the October 7 attack . He blamed Hamas for the war and said that more people should call for the terror group to lay down its arms . & ldquo;It is Hamas that is putting [ Palestinian ] civilians in harm's way . I am surprised that I do not hear more people say why doesn&rsquo;t Hamas move out of schools ? why doesn&rsquo;t Hamas take additional steps to protect civilians ? Because we think they should as we think Israel should . & ldquo;We would welcome Hamas laying down its arms at any point , & rdquo ; he added . & ldquo;They could do it today if they cleared about Palestinian civilian life . & rdquo;Miller also called on Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza , as Hamas asserted that close to 16,000 Palestinians have been killed in war-related violence.The United States is watching IDF actions in Gaza & ldquo;very closely , & rdquo ; Miller said as he explained that there were differences between Israel&rsquo;s military campaign that resumed on December 1 and the one that ended on November 24 . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Too many Palestinians were killed in the opening weeks of the conflict , & ldquo ; Miller said . & ldquo;We have seen a more targeted request for evacuations&rdquo ; by Israel so that the army is focused on clearing specific points rather than asking an entire city to evacuate , Miller said.Civilians have been asked to relocate to & ldquo;de-confliction zones rather than being asked to flee , Miller said.During US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Israel last week , he clarified to officials & ldquo;We do not want a military campaign in the south that looks like it was in the north . & rdquo;Blinken was briefed & ldquo;on plans intended to avoid mass casualties . & rdquo;It was understood that there would be civilian casualties , & ldquo;that is true in all war zones and is particularly true here&rdquo ; given that Hamas operates from within civilian areas , Miller said.Both Miller and Sullivan addressed the collapse hostage deal by which 81 women and children were freed , but there are still some 17 or 20 women and children among the captives.Qatar and Egypt mediated the deal . Sullivan said that Israel and US officials are still in conversation with those two countries to seek a way to resume hostage releases.Miller said that the hostage deal partially fell apart last week because Hamas wanted to prevent the remaining Israeli women it holds in Gaza from talking about their time in captivity . & ldquo;It seems one of the reasons they don&rsquo;t want to turn women over that they have been holding hostage and the reason this pause fell apart is that they do not want these women to be able to talk about what happened to them during their time in captivity , & rdquo ; Miller alleged during an emotional moment in the press conference.Later in the briefing , Miller clarified that he does not know this claim to be a definitive fact.Separately , in the briefing in Washington , Miller addressed the issue of settler violence saying that the US has also spoken with Israel about doing more to crack down on attacks against innocent Palestinians in the West Bank , Miller said . & ldquo;We have seen them take some steps to respond to violence . We do not think those steps have been sufficient . They need to prosecute people who engage in violence against [ innocent ] Palestinians , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;We have made very clear to the Israeli government that we will be taking additional steps to hold people accountable for violent extremism , & rdquo ; he said , explaining that this could include visa restrictions.Miller also addressed the issue of rising antisemitism , condemning it in the strongest terms . & ldquo;We oppose antisemitism wherever we see it , & rdquo ; Miller said . It&rsquo;s tragic that after October 7 , & ldquo;one of the responses has been an increase in antisemitism that is extremely tragic and it&rsquo;s incumbent on everyone in positions of authority to speak out . & rdquo ;",us : idf expected not to attack ‘ no-strike zones ’ in south gaza

The bill is aimed at simplifying imports of food marketed in the European Union and adopting more fully EU food and supplement regulatory standards , said the ministry.The proposal's main goal is to adopt EU regulations in additional areas of food safety , including regulations regarding what information must be provided to consumers about food products and gluten in food , regulations about adding vitamins and minerals to food , dietary supplements , and more . The ministry added that the proposal expanded the adoption of EU regulations from the four currently adopted to 20 . "" The move brings us towards harmony with European law for anything to do with food safety , "" said the ministry . & nbsp;The ministerial Cost of Living Committee , chaired by Economy Minister Nir Barkat , approved the reform late last month . The legislation is expected to be completed by the end of April 2024.Following other legislation aimed at lowering cost of livingThe draft bill follows the 2021 Israeli Government's decision to open the market to imports and decrease the cost of living . By reducing the amount of red tape and paperwork that foreign manufacturers and importers face , the government hopes to increase market competition within Israel , thereby reducing the steep cost of living.In January , State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman disclosed a report addressing the cost of living in Israel . & nbsp;This report revealed that food prices in Israel are 51 % higher compared to European Union countries and 37 % higher than the OECD average.The draft is the first version of the law , and is available for public comment from now until March 22.Jerusalem Post staff and & nbsp;Zachy Hennessey contributed to this report",import reform set to cut cost of living bill drafted
2024-03-12 17:30:58.233,jpost,"Hezbollah is currently engaged in a war of attrition on the Israeli border , but it is not unlikely that they will receive orders from Tehran to redirect forces to another area they recently fought in & ndash ; northern Syria . In the past week , a wave of protests began in every district of the rebel-held Idlib province in northwestern Syria . This is the last stronghold of the Syrian opposition and the last remnant of the civil war in Syria from a decade ago , a war that ended in other areas of the country in 2018.Syria's Idlib district is not ready to surrenderAt the height of the civil war in Syria in 2015 , opposition forces , led by Jabhat al-Nusra , a jihadist faction of al-Qaeda in Syria , united . The coalition of Islamist organizations pushed the Syrian army out of the Idlib district and has held most of it to this day . This is a district that the Syrian regime cannot afford to ignore due to its strategic location . Idlib is very close to Latakia & ndash ; the stronghold of Syria's ruling Alawite community , as well as to Russian military bases in Syria & ndash ; the Russian-operated air force base in Hmeimim and the naval port in Tartus . Despite the relentless Syrian air force bombings on the Idlib district ( including even to the present day ) , the opposition maintains control of the area with impressive tenacity . It seems that in recent years , even Assad's supporters have given up hope of seizing control of Idlib . Shi'ite militias have depleted their forces in Syria , and most of Hezbollah's men have returned to Lebanon . The Russians ' attention is elsewhere too , as they are deeply involved in the war in Ukraine.Bashar Assad's army is not capable of effectively fighting , due to the significant wear and tear it has endured . The economy of Syria is shattered , unemployment is rampant , and the currency continues to lose its value . There is no money to sustain the army or rebuild it significantly . However , this does not stop Assad's army from continuing to bomb the civilians of Idlib indiscriminately . The regime's message is clear : life in the "" liberated "" territories will remain a hell until they return to Assad's rule.The rulers of Idlib are trying to gain local legitimacy . They changed the name of their organization from Jabhat al-Nusra to "" Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham "" ( Organization for the Liberation of the Levant or HTS ) and seemingly distanced themselves from al-Qaeda , but they remain a jihadist fundamentalist group . The areas under the organization's control essentially are Islamic emirates with strict religious laws . The region does receive support from Turkey , mainly felt in civilian areas , especially regarding food . However , Turkish aid is limited as Turkey itself is experiencing a complex economic crisis . Overall , the Idlib province suffers from severe poverty and unemployment.Israel is also involved without even knowing itBoth sides , the Syrian regime and the opposition in Idlib , accuse each other of receiving Israeli support . The opposition constantly compares Assad's bombings on schools and hospitals to the current situation in Gaza : to them , Assad and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are two similar enemies . The only place in Syria where demonstrations in support of Gaza have taken place since October 7 was in Idlib province . By contrast , the Syrian regime accuses the opposition of seeking help from Israel , as the Israeli Air Force often bombs Assad's supporters in Syria & ndash ; mainly Shi'ite terrorist groups such as Hezbollah . It seems that in the Middle East , the enemy of your enemy can still be your enemy.Opportunity for the Syrian regimeLast week , protests began in various areas of Idlib province against the rule of HTS and specifically against the leader of the organization , Abu Mohammad al-Julani . Al Jazeera recently covered the developments in the province with concern.According to Al Jazeera , which is known for its support of Islamic organizations , the protest arose due to two issues : political and economic & ndash ; the authoritarian rule of the provincial leader , accusations of corruption , and the severe economic crisis . Julani's organization recently carried out a wave of arrests of around a thousand activists from various opposition organizations in the province , including activists who had previously belonged to his organization . The released detainees reported severe torture of prisoners who were arrested on suspicion of collaborating with the Assad regime . Analysts attribute the deteriorating situation to the lack of a political solution and a significant reduction in international aid to the province in recent months . This crisis was created due to the uncompromising and unyielding stance of the zealous jihadist ruler Julani , who is not willing to make any political concessions . The current wave of protests openly calls for the overthrow of Julani's oppressive rule , which some compare to the repression of the Assad regime.The protesters claim that the current situation is even worse than during Assad's rule because it also includes religious repression in the style of ISIS . The protesters demand the establishment of a local council to run the province . HTS is now trying to calm the protests by releasing more prisoners , monitoring price increases , and easing some taxes . However , it seems that the protests have spiraled out of control and are only gaining momentum.Interpreters from the Lebanese Al-Mayadeen outlet revealed that behind the protests stands Turkey , which aims to undermine the control of Idlib from the hands of Julani and return it to the Free Syrian Army under Ankara's direct control . The recent developments undoubtedly weaken Julani , who still controls about 75 % of Idlib . This marks the breakdown of the coalition after many years of unity.An opportunity for Assad , a problem for HezbollahThe division , anarchy , and turmoil in the Idlib region undoubtedly present a golden opportunity for control in Damascus , which may not return . Now Assad's army could potentially enter the region with significant support to restore it to the embrace of the regime , after almost a decade of neglect . However , this would require substantial support forces . For the occupation of Idlib , a significant asset for the Assad regime in particular , and the "" resistance axis "" in general , Iran would need to send substantial forces . These forces mainly include Shi'ite Popular Mobilization Unit militias from Iraq and Hezbollah forces from Lebanon . However , Hezbollah cannot afford a two-front war.Now , Iran's axis of resistance , the Syrian regime , and Shi'ite militias face a crossroads : whether to continue the war in the Israeli arena or redirect forces to northern Syria ? In the case of the Israel front , it is a purposeless war with Hezbollah already suffering over 230 casualties and no achievements against the highly motivated and prepared IDF . In the case of Idlib , however , it presents an opportunity for a significant strategic victory against the disintegrating opposition.Will the Syrian arena affect our northern border ? Will Hezbollah agree to a compromise on our border in order to turn its attention to Syria ? Only time will tell.Dr .

And as the ongoing Israel-Hamas War shows , the conflict's importance and intensity show no sign of slowing down . & nbsp;But what is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ? Where did it start ? Who are the key players involved ? & nbsp;Here is everything you need to know.Where is Israel?Israel is a country in the Middle East , specifically in the Levant region . It is steeped in thousands of years of history and has been the home of numerous civilizations and religious faiths.Israel is bordered by Egypt , Jordan , Lebanon , Syria , and the Palestinian territories and is on the coast of both the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea . & nbsp;While most countries consider its capital to be Tel Aviv , Israel and a few other countries , such as the United States , recognize Jerusalem as the capital.Where is Palestine?Palestine is a self-proclaimed country , recognized largely as the Palestinian territories , located in the Middle East , specifically on the west bank of the Jordan River ( known colloquially as the West Bank ) and in a region along the Mediterranean coast known as the Gaza Strip . It is bordered by Israel , Jordan , and Egypt , with the Gaza Strip being on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea . & nbsp;Though it proclaims Jerusalem as its capital , its de facto capital is Ramallah in the West Bank.Where is Gaza?Gaza , known as the Gaza Strip , is a part of the Palestinian territories and is located along the Mediterranean coast . It borders Israel and Egypt and has three border crossings : the Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings with Israel and the Rafah crossing with Egypt.Has Israel recognized Palestine?Israel has refused to recognize a Palestinian state , though progress had been made following the Oslo Accords . & nbsp;Currently , Israel officially supports the idea of a two-state solution . Still , it is at odds with the proposed Palestinian borders , as well as the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the possibility of Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israel . & nbsp;However , Israel does recognize Palestinian control over certain parts of the West Bank.Does Palestine recognize Israel?Palestine technically does recognize Israel , with then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat announcing it as such in 1988 . This was reaffirmed following the signing of the Oslo Accords . However , the Palestinian leadership continues to have strong opposition to the State of Israel , and many Palestinian factions disagree with the recognition of Israel.Israel is oftentimes referred to by these bodies as the "" Zionist occupation . "" What is the Palestinian Authority?The Palestinian Authority is the official ruling entity in the Palestinian territories . It is led by President Mahmoud Abbas and is controlled by his Fatah party . & nbsp;The PA is based in Ramallah and exercises control over the Palestinian-run areas of the West Bank , as well as claiming control over the Gaza Strip . & nbsp;The government was meant to be an interim body rather than a permanent political entity . & nbsp;Officially a democracy , the Palestinian Authority is , in practice , an authoritarian entity , not having had elections since 2006 , with further attempts at having elections never actually manifesting . & nbsp;Abbas was elected to a four-year term in 2005 , though his term in office has continued for almost two decades at the time of writing . & nbsp;The PA has also been accused of violating human rights , censoring a free press , and engaging in widespread corruption . & nbsp;Currently , the PA is fractured following the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections , which saw the terrorist group and party Hamas win control of the parliament . Since then , a schism has erupted between Fatah and Hamas , and attempts at mending this split have been unsuccessful.What is Hamas?Hamas is a Palestinian Islamist terrorist group that was founded in 1987 by Ahmed Yassin . Its origins lie in a Muslim charity organization , Mujama al-Islamiya , affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood organization . & nbsp;Since its official founding in 1987 , Hamas has become infamous for its terrorist activities and its staunch refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist . & nbsp;Hamas won the 2006 Palestinian parliamentary elections , but the Palestinian Authority dissolved the government and replaced it with a Fatah-led one , leading to the schism mentioned above.Hamas has fought several armed conflicts with Israel since taking over Gaza , with the current ongoing war being sparked by Hamas's attack on southern Israel on October 7 , 2023 , which saw 1,200 people in Israel killed and 250 people taken hostage . & nbsp;Hamas's leadership is spread out between Gaza and Qatar . Its leader in Gaza is Yahya Sinwar , while the organization's overall political leader is Ismail Haniyeh.When did the Israeli-Palestinian conflict begin?The starting point of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the subject of fierce debate since many believe the Palestinian national identity didn't begin until the middle of the 20th century . In contrast , others believe the Israeli national identity did not technically exist until the establishment of the State of Israel . & nbsp;What is agreed upon , though , is that Jews and Arabs have conflicted with one another in the region since the late 19th and early 20th centuries . & nbsp;This coincided with the arrival of Jewish Zionist settlers into the future State of Israel to escape antisemitic persecution in Europe . At the time , the land was ruled over by the Ottoman Empire , though by the end of World War I , the British took it over and instituted the British Mandate of Palestine . & nbsp;Over the coming decades , the two demographics would grow increasingly in conflict as tensions grew , with the Arabs staging multiple revolts in the mandate . In 1947 , a plan was proposed by the British to partition Israel into Jewish and Arab states . The Jews agreed , but the Arabs did not . & nbsp;A year later , Israel declared independence , and war was declared . Surrounded on all sides by enemy nations , Israel proved victorious , and many Arabs ended up fleeing their homes - an event Palestinians refer to today as the Nakba . & nbsp;Tensions exploded in the late 1980s as Palestinians launched the First Intifada , an uprising aimed at lashing out at what they perceived as an oppressive Israeli occupation . The intifada ended with the signing of the Oslo Accords , which many hoped would lead to a lasting peace . However , fierce opposition by hardliners among both Israelis and Palestinians prevented this , particularly with the assassination of Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and the election of a new right-wing Israeli government.In 2000 , the Second Intifada started up , lasting several years and seeing multiple casualties . It ultimately ended following the unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip , though it continues to have control over Gaza's borders and airspace.While the most visible part of the conflict now takes place in Gaza , there is still considerable tension among Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank and east Jerusalem , where terrorist attacks and bouts of violence still occur.Are Israel and Palestine fighting over Gaza?The ongoing Israel-Hamas War is fought largely in the Gaza Strip , but it is not a fight "" over "" Gaza . Only a small minority of Israeli lawmakers are calling for the full annexation of Gaza . Rather , the ongoing war is over the eradication of Hamas and the freeing of the hostages held in Gaza .",everything you need to know about the israeli-palestinian conflict
2024-05-30 21:04:00.280,jpost,"The share of Israeli Jews who believe an Israeli and a Palestinian state can peacefully coexist has plummeted since October 7 , according to a new survey.The figure of 19 % , reported in a study published Thursday by the Pew Research Center , was the lowest since Pew started surveying Israelis in 2013 . It is down from 32 % in a survey released just weeks before the war broke out.In 2013 , according to Pew , nearly half of Israeli Jews & mdash ; and a majority of Israelis overall & mdash ; supported a two-state solution . In 2005 , another polling firm found that most Israeli Jews supported the establishment of a Palestinian state.This year , a quarter of Israeli adults overall & mdash ; including nearly half of Israeli Arabs & nbsp ; & mdash ; believe a Palestinian state and Israel can peacefull exist side-by-side . That takeaway is one of a number from Thursday&rsquo;s Pew survey that show Israelis hunkering down for more conflict as the Israel-Hamas war is about to enter its eighth month . The survey of roughly 1,000 Israeli adults was taken in March and April & mdash ; before Israel&rsquo;s invasion of the Gaza city of Rafah and other recent developments & mdash ; and has a margin of error of 4 % . The survey also shows wide gaps between Jewish and Arab respondents . Among Arab Israelis , for example , 74 % say & ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s military response against Hamas in Gaza has gone too far . & rdquo ; Only four percent of Jewish Israelis agree.And while 76 % of Jewish Israelis say Israel will achieve its goals in the war , only half as many Arab Israelis , 38 % , say the same.But Israeli Arabs and Jews share some of the same concerns about the war : 61 % of both groups are worried about the war spreading to other fronts & mdash ; a concern that has been top-of-mind for many in the region and beyond after constant exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon , the first direct attacks between Iran and Israel and violence on other fronts.And at a time when Tzachi Hanegbi , Israel&rsquo;s national security adviser , said he anticipated the war will last until the end of this year , the poll found that significant majorities of both groups ( 77 % of Arabs , 66 % of Jews ) are worried about the war & ldquo;lasting a long time . & rdquo;Some 40 % of Israeli believe Israel should control Gaza postwarThe poll also measured one of the most vexing and divisive questions of the war : Who should control Gaza when the battles are over . The lack of a detailed plan for a postwar scenario has led to rifts within Israel&rsquo;s government as well as between Israel and the United States.The poll found that 40 % percent of Israelis , including half of the Jewish respondents , believe that Israel should continue to control the territory in a postwar scenario , while 18 % believe it should be run by a version of the Palestinian Authority & mdash ; which governs Palestinian population centers in the West Bank but which Netanyahu has shut out . Meanwhile , 14 % say people who live in Gaza should decide who governs them . Nine percent of Arab Israelis , and 2 % of Jewish Israelis , say Hamas should continue to rule the enclave.In addition to being taken before the launch of the Rafah operation , the poll was conducted before other landmark developments of recent weeks & mdash ; including a prosecutor for the International Criminal Court announcing he was seeking Netanyahu&rsquo;s arrest and President Joe Biden saying that he would suspend delivery of some large bombs to Israel in a bid to influence the scope of Israel&rsquo;s Rafah invasion.But even before those events , the poll showed disapproval of Biden&rsquo;s handling of the war rising in Israel . Biden was broadly popular among Israelis for his embrace of the country following Oct . 7 , but by the time the poll was taken , 60 % percent of Israeli Jews & mdash ; and 86 % of Israeli Arabs & mdash ; said they did not approve of how he was handling the war.Also unpopular was Netanyahu who , the poll found , had a lower favorability rating than at any point in the 11 years Pew has asked the question , at 41 % . The two other leaders in his war cabinet , Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz , fared better , with Gantz at 51 % and Gallant at 61 % . A more recent poll shows that Netanyahu&rsquo;s popularity , which nosedived after Oct . 7 , is recovering among the Israeli public .","after oct . 7 , only 19 % of israeli jews believe in peaceful coexist with a palestinian state - poll"
2024-03-15 05:43:55.460,jpost,"It was a rough European week for Israeli basketball teams as Hapoel Tel Aviv was eliminated from the EuroCup by Besiktas and Hapoel Jerusalem will have to wait yet another week to find a way to clinch a place in the Basketball Champions League postseason after being crushed by Peristeri.While Hapoel Holon stayed alive for a place in the BCL quarterfinals with a win over Promitheas , the Purples&rsquo ; chances to advance are slim due to the point differential gap within their round-of-16 group.Hapoel Tel Aviv crashed out of Europe after falling to Besiktas 94-89 in the EuroCup quarterfinals to end its continental campaign on a sour note in Vilnius , Lithuania.The Reds jumped all over the Turkish squad as Will Cummings scored at will while Bar Timor and Jaylen Hoard helped Tel Aviv build up a 57-39 advantage at halftime . However , Besiktas started to chip away at the lead with huge baskets by Jonah Mathews , Matthew Mitchell and Derek Needham and while Tomer Ginat tried to keep Hapoel ahead Mitchell from deep and Mathews from the line completed the comeback and notched the win for the visitors.Cummings scored 28 points , Hoard added 16 points while Timor and Tomer Ginat each scored 13 points for Tel Aviv in the loss . Mathews led Besiktas with 28 points , Mitchell chipped in with 22 points as Needham scored 14 points . & ldquo;Besiktas opened up the second half much more aggressive and unfortunately we fell into that letting them build the momentum , & rdquo ; Hapoel Tel Aviv coach Danny Franco said . & ldquo;We played our exact game plan trying to go at specific guys and get them loaded with fouls , but it only worked until a point . Ultimately , we couldn&rsquo;t make the plays we needed to . & rdquo ; & ldquo;But I guess that&rsquo;s a price we are paying for a lot of guys kind of being out of shape or not really in a good mood that they can come right up and stay as focused and balanced all the way through . & rdquo;When in GreeceIn Greece , Hapoel Holon slipped by Promitheas 93-92 in a thriller to keep alive its slim chances to advance to the Basketball Champions League quarterfinals.The Purples took control of the game early as Kevin Hervey , Tahjere McCall and Justin Smith were all busy to grab a 47-34 lead at halftime . But Cameron Reynolds and Anthony Cowan helped the hosts come all the way back to tie the game up at 90-90 with under a minute to go in regulation.However , Holon coach Amit Sherf drew up a perfect play for a Drew Crawford 3-pointer to put the visitors ahead for good to take the victory.Hervey scored 20 points , McCall added 14 points and Yotam Hanochi scored 12 points in the win . Cowan scored 30 points to pace Promitheas and Reynolds added 19 points in the loss.With the win , Holon ( 3-2 ) will have an opportunity next week to punch its ticket to the quarterfinals of the competition if it can defeat Murcia in Hungary and AEK bests Promitheas . Should that not happen , the Purples&rsquo ; European adventure will come to a close . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big win especially here at Promitheas who are a very good team , & rdquo ; Sherf said . & ldquo;We needed to win by double digits and while this was a great game for us , the loss against Promitheas in Hungary made us have to deal with point differential . We will go to Murcia and hope that AEK will be able to defeat Promitheas and we can advance from a very tough group . & rdquo;Hervey spoke about the win . & nbsp ; & ldquo;It was a great game from the team . We shot well and shared the ball , we had some defensive lapses but we did enough to win the game . & rdquo;In Hungary , Hapoel Jerusalem was crushed by Peristeri 76-61 in Basketball Champions League round-of-16 Group Stage play and will now enter the final gameday next week needing a win over Karsiyaka to advance to the quarterfinals of the competition.The Greeks came out passing and controlled the tempo from the get-go , with Joe Ragland leading the way to take a 44-37 lead at halftime.The Reds tried to cut down the slim advantage , but Ragland and Elijah Mitrou-Long were too much for Speedy Smith and the rest of the Jerusalem squad as they cruised to the victory.Smith scored 10 points for Hapoel as JaCorey Williams , Levi Randolph and Khadeen Carrington all scored nine points in the loss . Ragland scored 16 points , Mitrou-Long added 15 points and Trevor Thompson scored 10 points in the win . & ldquo;There are not a lot of things for us to keep from this game , & rdquo ; Jerusalem coach Ilias Kantzouris said . & ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t show up on offense and there was a lack of energy . We have to be more ready and we didn&rsquo;t execute . We were always late on loose balls and we have to wait another week not to play Karsiyaka in order to advance to the Elite 8 . & rdquo;Hapoel&rsquo;s Brynton Lemar reflected on the loss . & ldquo;It was a tough game , Peristeri came ready and we were lacking a little energy and missing assignments that we are normally accustomed to . This is the BCL and every game is tough . We have to get back to our identity and I am sure we will .

2021-09-26 18:44:42.707,jpost,"The Palestinian Authority has instructed its security forces to take all measures to halt increased lawlessness and anarchy in Hebron and its surroundings , a senior PA official said on Sunday . & ldquo;The instructions from the Palestinian leadership are clear and firm , & rdquo ; the official told The Jerusalem Post . & ldquo;There will be zero tolerance for anyone who breaks the law and intimidates the residents . & rdquo ; The instructions came in response to accusations by many residents , including senior Fatah officials and heads of local clans , that the PA was not doing anything to stop the recent wave of violent crime in the Hebron area . Last week , Emad Khurwat , a senior Fatah official in Hebron , accused the PA of & ldquo;conspiring&rdquo ; against the city . He also threatened to prevent Palestinian officials from entering Hebron and said that Fatah gunmen were ready to replace the PA security forces in enforcing law and order . Khurwat and other residents claimed that the city was now controlled by large clans that have dozens of gunmen who often intimidate and extort residents . Khurwat&rsquo;s unprecedented and public threat is seen by local residents as a direct challenge to the PA leadership . It also reflects increased tensions between local Fatah activists and the leadership of the faction , which is headed by PA President Mahmoud Abbas . Over the past few weeks , some of the clans deployed scores of gunmen in various parts of Hebron as part of family feuds , during which a number of people were killed and several businesses set on fire . Hebron has long been famous for its tribal justice system , whereby rival clans and individuals solve their disputes , including murder cases , away from the PA&rsquo;s official judiciary system . On Saturday , PA Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh visited Hebron , where he chaired an emergency meeting of the commanders of the various branches of the Palestinian security forces to discuss the deterioration of the security situation in the city and its surrounding villages and towns . The meeting was attended by PA Governor of Hebron Jibrin al-Bakri . During the meeting , which was held at the headquarters of the Hebron Governorate , Shtayyeh was briefed on the security situation . According to the PA&rsquo;s official news agency Wafa , Shtayyeh was also briefed on & ldquo;Israeli violations in light of the high pace of settlement expansion , land seizure , settler attacks , and incursions into the Ibrahimi Mosque [ Tomb of the Patriarchs ] . & rdquo ; The Palestinians regularly describe visits by Jews to the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron and al-Aqsa Mosque compound on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem as & ldquo;incursions . & rdquo ; & ldquo;Shtayyeh affirmed the directives of President Mahmoud Abbas to meet the demands of the [ Hebron ] governorate , foremost of which is strengthening the steadfastness of the citizens , providing security and safety for them and their properties , and maintaining civil peace , & rdquo ; Wafa reported . After the meeting , a PA official in Hebron said that orders have been issued to the Palestinian security forces to arrest residents involved in violent crime and to collect illegal weapons . The official claimed that one of the main obstacles facing law-enforcement agencies was the fact that many of the suspected criminals have found shelter in the Israeli-controlled part of Hebron .","pa orders crackdown on criminals , illegal weapons in hebron"
2024-03-16 07:16:02.000,jpost,"The six small stand-up boxes contain three-dimensional dolls in Inca costumes , complete with their traditional designs and surrounded by ceramic pots , also in the traditional style . Highly colorful , these miniature dolls are amazingly made out of potato flour ! Peruvian artist Zuly Jimenez had been asked by Jerusalem-based artist David Moss to illustrate the Purim story as told in the Scroll of Esther as if it were set in the artist&rsquo;s own surroundings . Jimenez decided to root her interpretation in Peru&rsquo;s ancient culture , which meant going back to a time when the Incas ruled the land . One innovation among many was the depiction of Haman leading Mordechai sitting on a llama , since , as she explained , the horse had not been introduced into this part of the world until the Spaniards came and conquered Peru.The experience of making these models was for Jimenez & ldquo;unforgettable&rdquo ; in that it combined art and history , legend and story-telling . It was precisely the reaction that Moss was looking for and had already received from his many guest artists from around the world over the previous thirty years when he started this unique project . & ldquo;In 1990 , I was in Bali , Indonesia , & rdquo ; he recalled , & ldquo;searching for craftspeople for another project of mine , when I viewed the beautiful miniatures being produced by the local artists . Bali , a traditional Hindu society , is full of palaces , royalty , princes and princesses , ceremonies and rituals . All these things strongly reminded me of the story of Esther and Purim . So when I went back the second time , I asked artists from two different villages to do their take on the story . I gave them parchment and the story of Esther translated into Indonesian . I drew six small blank rectangles and I told them to imagine that this story was happening right in their village . The six scenes I asked them to envisage included Achashverus&rsquo;s party at the beginning of the story ; the beauty contest in which Esther participates and wins ; the reaching out of the scepter by the king to Esther ; Haman leading Mordechai on the king&rsquo;s horse ; the hanging of Haman&rsquo;s ten sons ; and the writing out of the megilla to go out to all the lands of the king&rsquo;s massive kingdom . I didn&rsquo;t want them to imagine Persia or anything to do with the original story . It had to be local in their own culture and style . I waited for the responses . When I viewed the stunningly original crafted images they had produced , it gave me another thought : Perhaps I could expand this idea by seeking out folk artists from around the world willing to depict these same six scenes in their own vernacular culture and style . Thus began a fascinating , bizarre thirty-year quest I&rsquo;ve come to call Esther without Borders , & rdquo ; said Moss.Esther without BordersAlthough it was initially happenstance that energized the beginnings of the project , Moss&rsquo;s enthusiasm only grew as he encountered folk artists from around the world who responded positively to his strange request . In the course of his ongoing project , he encountered artists from Ukraine , Russia , Bali , India , Italy , Ecuador , Colombia , Panama , California , New Mexico , and so on , thus echoing the megilla&rsquo;s Achashveros , whose kingdom spread from & ldquo;Hodu to Kush&rdquo ; ( India to Ethiopia ) . The original Purim has a profoundly universal flavor . & ldquo;I initially sought out folk artists , & rdquo ; said Moss , & ldquo ; although I&rsquo;ve asked a few professional artists , too . Another change came about when I approached an artist in Italy whose charming work I had spotted in a small exhibition in the Piedmont region . He said he&rsquo;d love to do the project but that he could not work in the miniature format I had been requesting . I told him to use whatever format he liked . He was very imaginative , created a delightful accordion book , and also drew the main characters from the story on the back of the work . He had a great sense of humor , depicting the eunuch of the king , for example , with a pair of scissors on his turban ! & nbsp ; & ldquo;Once the mold was broken , I let the rest of the artists do the images in whatever format they were most comfortable with . This came to mean the project has been done on tiles , fabrics , icons , and envelopes , as well as on paper and parchment . & rdquo;Although Moss is a much traveled artist , the language of communication with the artists does sometimes present problems . & ldquo;With the Italian artist , I found a nearby gallery owner who helped locate and communicate with the artist . I use Google Translate to communicate with many of the artists . Fortunately , the Book of Esther is also in the Christian Bible , which has been translated into hundreds of languages . I send the artists the entire book in their own language and highlight the six verses , & rdquo ; he explained . & nbsp ; & ldquo;A friend was headed off to Australia , and I asked her to propose the project to an Aboriginal artist if she came across one . She found Emma Burchill , a wonderful artist who did the project in their highly abstract , symbolic style . She explained to me how the Aborigines paint their works using dots as if they were looking down at the scene from a bird&rsquo;s eye view . Therefore , she showed the feast viewed from above as their campfire , with the guests dancing the traditional corrobbree ceremony around the fire . & rdquo ; & nbsp;He did not have to travel for every artist . Some came to him in his studio in Huzot Hayotzer beneath the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem . Moss met Boris Gozzo , a talented Ukrainian artist living in Israel whose illustrations portrayed some of the men in the scene as drunken peasants.Most years , the art studios in Huzot Hayotzer play host to an international arts and crafts fair , so it was that Moss met Rajendra Kumar Moktan from Nepal whose expertise is in the creation of mandelas & ndash ; prayer wheels used in Buddhist and Hindu sacred rites and as an instrument of meditation . The detailed scenes he painted on canvas truly convey the ceremonies of Nepalese culture . & nbsp;When I met Moss in his somewhat overcrowded studio , he had just got off the phone with a woman from Portugal . & ldquo;Her name is Teresa , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;She works on Azulejo tiles in the blue and white ceramic tradition from the 17th and 18th century . They were influenced by Delft tiles . She had just sent me a sketch of what she is doing and wrote to me that she was finishing the last tile . She had painted the stations of the cross in ceramics for her local cathedral and the tiles for the Esther story were done in this strong Portuguese , Christian tradition . & rdquo;Not that every encounter is successful . & ldquo;I tried a Chinese artist but didn&rsquo;t like what he did . I&rsquo;ll have to go back there and try someone else . Also , although I pay the artists whatever fee they request , if they ask more than I can afford , I let it go , & rdquo ; he said.It is perhaps not surprising that some of these artists became firm friends . & ldquo;In Morro Bay , California , I met Philip Carey , who specialized in drawing delightful miniature scenes on envelopes and mailing them to their destination via the post office . They are whimsical and full of humor . I marveled how he translated the Esther story into his envelope art . He portrayed each of the figures as being from the animal world . So his king is a Monarch butterfly , Esther is a Morro Bay sea otter , Mordechai a bald eagle riding on a sea horse , Haman is depicted as a coyote , and so forth . Esther sends out the Purim story by & lsquo;seamail&rsquo ; on seahorses , and & lsquo;landmail&rsquo ; with roadrunners . Philip executed all these envelope images in ink and colored pencil and then sent them to me through the post office . We were in close contact over the years , but tragically he has passed away . I treasure these miniature masterpieces that so embody who he was . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Although Moss was happy to give many of these artists some visibility , he came upon one group of unknown artists who had simply disappeared . These were the Mimbres , an extinct civilization from southern New Mexico who flourished between 1,000 and 1,150 CE and then vanished , leaving behind no writing . All that remains of them are the ruins of their buildings and their black-and-white pottery with unique stylized designs . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I was always captivated by the powerful designs they left behind , and felt that it was somehow unfair that I was limiting my project to living cultures . I decided to imagine myself as an ancient Mimbres artist and designed the six Esther scenes as round , bowl-like images based on what was recovered from their tradition , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp;Moss , an internationally recognized book artist , calligrapher , designer of ketubot and architectural designs , appreciates how he has succeeded sufficiently well to have the ability and willingness to help fellow artists who were not so fortunate . At the same time , he has not rushed this project nor does he have future plans for it . & ldquo;I love that there is no end , goal , or deadline to this , & rdquo ; he confessed . & ldquo;People have suggested that I turn it into a book , others that it should be exhibited . My daughter Elyssa runs a center opposite my studio called Kol HaOt , which brings together art and Judaism . We did do a small show of these works there . But the beauty of this project for me is in the remarkable people it has connected me with , the thrill and surprise of opening each new contribution , and the sheer joy of watching a simple idea unfold and blossom in so many surprising ways . & rdquo;Whichever way Moss decides , it would indeed be a pity if this impressive project were not viewed by a much larger audience . But maybe , as he jokes , he&rsquo;s going to wait until he reaches 127 nations & ndash ; from India to Ethiopia and beyond ! ■",david moss's purim project : esther without borders
2021-01-28 16:24:13.983,jpost,"An angry & quot;protest note&quot ; from Jordan has demanded that Israel stop hindering restoration work at Jerusalem @ @ @ s al-Aqsa mosque compound , Islam @ @ @ s third holiest site . Jordanian foreign ministry spokesman Daifallah Alfayez said the note sent on Monday urged Israel to & quot;refrain from such violations and provocations , and respect the mandate of Jordan in administering Muslim holy sites . & quot ; Israeli officials did not respond to requests from The Media Line for comment . Jordan&rsquo;s King Abdullah II is the custodian of Muslim holy sites in east Jerusalem , an arrangement agreed upon in the 1994 peace deal between the two countries . Under the agreement , Israel recognizes Jordan @ @ @ s guardianship of Islamic and Christian holy sites in east Jerusalem , which was captured and annexed by Israel in 1967 . Wakf , the Islamic endowments authority run by Jordan , this week accused the Israel Police of preventing its employees from conducting restoration work on the Dome of the Rock shrine . Jordan insists that the Wakf is & quot;the sole authority responsible for the supervision and maintenance of al-Aqsa . & quot ; Jawad Anani , a former deputy prime minister and former foreign minister of Jordan , told The Media Line from Amman that Jordan @ @ @ s role in east Jerusalem is a redline for the king . & quot;The Jerusalem issue for His Majesty the King is very important . Islamic and Christian holy places in Jerusalem are under Hashemite guardianship , & quot ; he said . Anani , who also served as chief of the Royal Court , and coordinator of Jordan&rsquo;s peace negotiating team with Israel , says that Israeli domestic politics is a factor in the rising tension . & quot;We see this as a challenge for Jordan and His Majesty . The reason is that the current Israeli administration is seeking to gain votes , because ( Prime Minister Benjamin ) Netanyahu is in a difficult and critical situation . He tries to appease the extremists and religious people in Israel , & quot ; he said . Oded Eran , a former Israeli ambassador to Jordan , concedes that the relationship between the two countries is at its lowest point . & quot;I think the relations are not frozen , but I would say quite cold , & quot ; he said . Eran , who was Israel @ @ @ s top diplomat in Amman from 1997 to 2000 , says that despite their problems , the two countries cooperate on some issues , including intelligence and security . & quot;There are contacts between the two ministries of foreign affairs , the ministers met twice in recent months , and they discussed cooperation on many issues , & quot ; he said . But Abdullah and Netanyahu have not spoken to each other for some time , he added , which says a lot about the state of relations between the two countries . He compares this to the & ldquo;warmth&rdquo ; of the relationship between the late Jordanian King Hussein and the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin . Anani said that there is & ldquo;no chemistry&rdquo ; between the current king and prime minister . & quot;The relationship has gone nowhere since Netanyahu took office . Full of challenges , there is a long list of actions that Netanyahu took that indicate his animosity , & quot ; he said . Unpopular among the majority of Jordanians , the 26-year-old peace treaty has withstood the test of time , in spite of increased tensions between Israel and Jordan in the last few years . The rising animosity between Jordan and Israel comes at a time when Israel is normalizing relations with four Arab states . & quot;Jordan found itself alone in standing firmly behind the Palestinian cause , while other Arab countries are normalizing relations with Israel , & quot ; Eran said . He added that these breakthrough accords should help Jordan , too . & quot;The addition of Arab states to the circle of normalization with Israel opens up the possibility of regional economic cooperation for which Jordan can certainly benefit in many sectors , & quot ; he said . Eran says good relations with Jordan should be a top priority for Israel . & quot;It is a very sad comment on the current state of affairs and one can only hope that a resumption of a political process as soon as possible between Israel and the Palestinians will also bring greater cooperation between Israel and Jordan , & quot ; he said . When Trump rolled out his vision for peace in the Middle East last January , he did it with little to no consultation with Abdullah . Making matters worse , there was the US position approving of Israeli plans to annex the West Bank portion of the Jordan Valley , which Amman strongly rejects , calling it a threat to its national security . Under the Trump Administration , Jordan&rsquo;s role in the region was marginalized . Trump bypassed the strategic relationship that the US had with the kingdom for decades , in favor of Gulf states . & quot;No one can exclude or circumvent Jordan&rsquo;s role in Jerusalem . There is no contesting of the Hashemite custody of the Holy Places , & quot ; Anani said .","tensions growing between israel , jordan over al-aqsa restoration work"

2024-05-30 18:41:39.167,jpost,"Former vice president Mike Pence told The Jerusalem Post on Wednesday that the US is obligated to allow Israel to defeat Hamas . Pence spoke to the Post ahead of its annual conference in New York City on Monday.Pence told the Post on Wednesday that & ldquo;the only message to our most cherished ally in this dire hour should be , & lsquo;America stands with Israel . & rsquo ; "" & ldquo;On October 7 , the Jewish people endured the deadliest attack since the Holocaust . The United States must give them our full support until Hamas has been destroyed once and for all , & rdquo ; he stated.Pence has maintained a strong relationship with Israel both before and after his tenure as Republican vice president . He continuously conveys a deep commitment to the US-Israel alliance via actions and statements.As vice president from 2017 to 2021 , Pence was a key figure in the Trump administration&rsquo;s pro-Israel policies , which included relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights . He also frequently emphasized the importance of the US-Israel relationship in his speeches and public appearances.Pence's visit to IsraelAfter the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 , Pence visited Israel in January to show solidarity . He met with soldiers and families affected by the attacks , stating , & ldquo;The American people are with you , & rdquo ; and emphasizing that the US will continue to support Israel until the threat from Hamas is eradicated.Further , he compared Israel&rsquo;s situation to the US after 9/11 , insisting that Israel deserved the same unwavering support that the US received after those terrorist attacks.Pence has also been vocal regarding efforts to limit Israel&rsquo;s military actions against Hamas by criticizing these attempts . He voiced his opposition to President Joe Biden&rsquo;s approach , asserting that Israel&rsquo;s actions should not be questioned , much like the US&rsquo;s post-9/11 decisions should not have been . Moreover , Pence has expressed concern over rising antisemitism and pro-Palestinian protests in the US , reaffirming that & ldquo;Israel&rsquo;s cause is our cause . & rdquo;Pence&rsquo;s commitment to Israel was also evident when he suspended his presidential campaign at the Republican Jewish Coalition&rsquo;s Annual Leadership Summit in October 2023 . He did so to highlight that he was against what he warned was a rise of populism in the Republican Party , in which he also emphasized the need for a robust foreign policy that supported Israel.The conference , which will take place on June 3 in New York , promises to be of paramount importance , especially given the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the broader turmoil in the Middle East . This year&rsquo;s gathering is expected to attract diplomats , politicians & ndash ; including Pence & ndash ; and business leaders , among others . & ldquo;The theme chosen for this year&rsquo;s conference , following the October 7 massacre , is : & lsquo;Israel Says Thank You , & rsquo ; & rdquo ; said Zvika Klein , the Post&rsquo;s Editor-in-Chief.He added that in recent months , & ldquo;tens of millions of readers have been visiting The Jerusalem Post website monthly to stay informed about what is happening in Israel during the most challenging period we have known since the establishment of the Jewish state . & rdquo;Regarding the conference , he said , & ldquo;We are excited to return to New York to meet our loyal readers and to engage in a genuine and honest conversation about the incredibly complex reality in Israel and the US over the past year . & rdquo;The event will feature strategic meetings , allowing attendees to network and share ideas with key figures in the Jewish world . CEO Inbar Ashkenazi highlighted this , saying that the Post & ldquo;is far more than just a media group . We are the gateway between Israel and the world . & rdquo;The conference will be live-streamed on the Post&rsquo;s website and social media channels , enabling a global audience to participate in these critical conversations . Last year&rsquo;s event attracted over 1.6 million online views and featured prominent Israeli politicians , including Chairman of the National Unity Party Benny Gantz and Economy and Industry Minister Nir Barkat .",pence to ' post ' : the us must give israel full support until hamas is destroyed
2021-05-20 16:01:45.450,jpost,"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps ( IRGC ) Quds Force head Esmail Ghaani praised Hamas on Thursday . Iran has been watching closely the Hamas tactics against Israel and is proud that the Hamas terrorists it supports are achieving what it claims is a victory against Israel . This includes claims Hamas has targeted more Israeli air bases and that the & ldquo;Zionist regime&rdquo ; is facing defeat , according to the IRGC . & nbsp ; In a letter to Hamas&rsquo;s military commander Mohammed Deif , the commander of the IRGC&rsquo;s Quds Force called him a & ldquo;living martyr&rdquo ; and wrote that he was confident of the victory of the & ldquo;resistance&rdquo ; in Gaza , according to Fars News . A reputed copy of the letter was also posted online . & ldquo;O&rsquo ; you living martyr who has spent his life in the front row of Jihad and is confident of victory ; I address you as a brave and devoted commander and I say to all the commanders and Mujahedin of the resistance groups on my behalf and on behalf of the leadership of the Islamic Republic and I promise that you will be victorious and you were faithful to your promise and to the enemy , & rdquo ; the posted version reads . & nbsp ; In the letter he claimed that Israel was tasting & ldquo;fear , defeat and humiliation . & rdquo ; He also wrote greetings to the people of Gaza and to Arabs living in Israel , as well as Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank . & ldquo;The Palestinian people have proved to the whole world that they are alive and that over the years they will not be able to forget their rights , as the delusional people thought . & rdquo ; He said that now Iran and its allies are in the midst of a & ldquo;great operation&rdquo ; called & ldquo;Saif al-Quds&rdquo ; or & ldquo;Sword of Jerusalem , & rdquo ; which has begun and entered a new phase of battle against Israel . The letter says that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei & ldquo;has emphasized that the countdown to the destruction of the enemy has begun . & rdquo ; This is in line with statements made in Iran over the past two weeks . It gives evidence of Iran&rsquo;s direct planning and role in Hamas attacks on Israel . Iran and Turkey have long backed Hamas . Turkish media has encouraged a pan-Islamic alliance of Iran , Turkey , Qatar , Pakistan and Malaysia to fight Israel . & nbsp ; Meanwhile Iran says Hamas has struck at Israeli airports , a key part of the Iranian plan apparently . In Iran IRGC commander Hossein Salami who had predicted Israel could be defeated with one large tactical operation gave a speech where he also praised the & ldquo;strong resistance put&rdquo ; up by the Palestinians in the face of Israel . & ldquo;More than two-thirds of Zionist cities were attacked by Palestinian rockets from Gaza , leaving no safe haven for them .

2024-03-27 05:23:53.667,jpost,"Matching Purim characters to the KnessetFormer Shas MK Yigal Guetta , who is now a radio and television broadcaster , was bantering before Purim about what identities members of Knesset should take , and came up with a beloved character of fiction & ndash ; Pinocchio , the key figure in an Italian children&rsquo;s novel written close to two centuries ago . Pinocchio&rsquo;s nose grew longer every time he told a lie.Israeli newspaper cartoonists apparently came up with a similar idea . For some years now , they have been depicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with an abnormally long nose . In actual fact , the prime minister&rsquo;s nose is not unusual in size , but he does have a tendency to arrogate to himself declarations and deeds , the credit for which belongs to others.Surprising Purim traditions&nbsp;Not everyone is aware that there is more than one Purim and even more than two or three . Prior to the reading of the Scroll of Esther , or the Megillah as it&rsquo;s generally known , at the Yad Vashem synagogue in Jerusalem , two senior staff from Yad Vashem&rsquo;s guiding department , Naama Galil and Yochai Copenhagen , presented an intriguing lesson on the history of Purim , how it is celebrated and commemorated in different countries and the special delicacies that are eaten.The reading of the scroll was done by Prof . Jonathan Halevy , the president of Shaare Zedek Medical Center , whose style and perfect enunciation make him a much in demand Torah reader at various Jerusalem synagogues.The Yad Vashem synagogue , designed by prizewinning , internationally acclaimed , Israeli-born architect Moshe Safdie , is in itself a mini museum , showcasing sacred items that are remnants of European synagogues destroyed during the Holocaust . The synagogue serves as an archive of memory to the once-flourishing Jewish communities of Europe . It is also a place for personal prayers in memory of relatives who were murdered or who perished in the ghettos and the camps.The synagogue has superb acoustics & ndash ; something that is not always taken into account in designs of buildings for public use.In the Balkans , according to the two Yad Vashem representatives , every time the Jewish community was saved from a massacre through some apparent miracle , another Purim was declared.The special cookies that are eaten on Purim , known as hamentashen , were originally called mohntashen & ndash ; poppy-seed pockets ; and in countries where Ladino is spoken rather than Yiddish or Hebrew , the recipes are somewhat different , and so are the names.There are four essential Purim commandments : to read or attend a reading of the Megillah ; to be joyful while simultaneously remembering attempts by despots to eliminate the Jews from the face of the earth ; to exchange gifts of food ; and to provide for the poor.Most of the people who attended the Purim service at the Yad Vashem synagogue were child Holocaust survivors , and quite a few came dressed in the Purim spirit.The evening concluded with a merry klezmer recital by Omri Rivlin and Vladimir Czeczlinski.On display , in front of the ark , was a centuries-old Scroll of Esther discovered and rescued from the Krakow Ghetto in March 1943.Legend has it that there was also a Queen Esther in Krakow , though there is no absolute proof . However , there is a street named after her in the old Jewish Quarter of Krakow . According to the story , she was exceedingly beautiful and caught the eye of King Casimir the Great . The main clue to any truth in the story is that Jews suffered great persecution in 14th-century Poland , and that after Casimir fell in love with Esther , persecution ceased . Esterka , as she was called , is referred to in both Jewish and Polish historical literature.Herzog delivers Megillah reading&nbsp;In any given week , President Isaac Herzog travels the length and breadth of the country , but for the Megillah reading on Sunday night , all he had to do was cross the road to the synagogue at the Theatron hotel , which is directly opposite the rear entrance to the President&rsquo;s Residence . Services are held daily in the beautifully appointed synagogue , and in recent months attendance has been gratifying , as nearly all the guest rooms are occupied by evacuees , most of whom are traditional in their religious observance.Joining Herzog at the service were evacuees from Kiryat Shmona , Sderot , and Shlomi.Herzog greeted the congregants , saying that it was very emotional for him to meet them , to strengthen them , and in particular to assure those from the North that he is well aware that they are living through a period of great uncertainty . He offered them encouragement in the knowledge that in the final analysis they would all return home in peace and by the grace of God . & ldquo;We all pray and work toward the speedy return of the hostages , & rdquo ; he said , quoting Maimonides . & ldquo;There is no greater deed than liberating captives . & rdquo;He also called for the strengthening of the Israel Defense Forces on land , sea , and in the air . His final appeal was for the preservation of national unity and love of Israel.The return of Adloyada&nbsp;There was considerable controversy in Jerusalem this year as to whether to hold an Adloyada parade during wartime . Those in favor said that the somber atmosphere of the nation should not be imposed on children , and that they should be allowed to celebrate and have fun . & nbsp;Those against said it would be a travesty to parade through the streets of the capital in joy , while the hostages kidnapped by Hamas were still languishing in Gaza.The various arguments prompted Aryeh Halivni , the founder of Toldot Israel , the anthology of Israel&rsquo;s contemporary history , to release an item about the beginnings of the Adloyada tradition.For those who may not be aware , it&rsquo;s customary to drink alcoholic beverages on Purim till one reaches the stage of losing awareness . & ldquo;Adloyada&rdquo ; is a conglomerate of three Hebrew words literally translated as & ldquo;till he didn&rsquo;t know . & rdquo;The excerpt from Toldot Israel reads as follows : & ldquo;In December 1931 , the Tel Aviv Municipality held a contest to choose a new name for the annual Purim festival . Suggestions came in from such noted authors as Bialik , Tchernichovsky , and Avraham Shlonsky . The winning entry came from Yitzhak Dov Berkowitz , Sholem Aleichem&rsquo;s son-in-law , and himself an Israel Prize-winning author . & ldquo ; & lsquo;Adloyada&rsquo ; is a contraction of & lsquo;ad d&rsquo;lo yada , & rsquo ; the Aramaic words in the Talmud that encourage drinking on Purim until one no longer knows the difference between blessed is Mordechai and cursed is Haman . The name stuck , and to this day , Purim celebrations throughout Israel are known as the & lsquo;Adloyada . & rsquo ; & rdquo;Purim history&nbsp;Currently doing the rounds on electronic media is a story about a Purim song . During Purim 1954 , Moshe Sharett , who was then prime minister , came to the Milo Club , which was then the cultural center of the Labor Party , and saw that everyone was in a dejected mood.Five years earlier , Yigal Alon had sent a cable to Israel&rsquo;s first prime minister , David Ben-Gurion , informing him of the conquest of Eilat.Following five-year anniversary celebrations , a busload of merrymakers who were returning home , on March 17 , 1954 , which coincided with the eve of Purim , was attacked by terrorists , plunging the whole country into shock , fear , and grief . Eleven of the passengers were murdered . . The tragedy hung like a cloud over planned festivities . The Purim party at the Milo Club at 16 Zamenhoff Street was anything but cheerful.In the crowd , Sharett caught sight of songwriters Ya&rsquo;akov Orland and Mordechai Zeira , who were then the celebrity songwriters of the nation , and whose works are still popular today . Sharett grabbed them by the arms , dragged them into the kitchenette , gave them a bottle of brandy , and demanded that they write a happy song to change the mood . He left them alone , and as he closed the door he told them not to exit until they could come up with a new , happy song.After a short time , the two emerged with the song written on a paper serviette . They started to perform it for Sharett , who was the product of a musical family . He immediately caught the tune , took a clarinet from the band and accompanied them.Returning to Israel post-pandemicBefore Covid , New Yorkers Leslie and Fern Penn used to come to Israel at least once every two years . For Leslie it was purely a vacation and a means of boning up on his knowledge of Zionist history and of Israel . For Fern , it was a mix of business and pleasure.The couple used to be the proprietors of a Made in Israel fashion , accessories and giftware store , and Fern&rsquo;s forays to Israel were to look at merchandise in the abovementioned categories . She made friends with Israeli designers , and even after she and Leslie gave up their enterprise due to soaring rents in the Big Apple , Fern remained involved with Israel by leading food and fashion tours to Israel.But then came the pandemic , during which many international airline services were suspended , and any plans the couple had for visiting Israel were put on hold.They finally returned to Israel last week , after an eight-year hiatus . It was not the Israel they remembered , though their two favorite hotels , the Dan in Tel Aviv and the King David in Jerusalem , still carried the quiet luxury aura of decades past , even though each had undergone subtle renovations.But streets in both cities had changed . Where once there had been single-story cottages , or three - or four-story apartment buildings , tall towers now dominate the skyline , and new streets have been created in some places.In New York , Leslie is the executive director of the Conservative Synagogue of Fifth Avenue , of which he was previously the longtime president . Fern prefers the Orthodox synagogue in Riverdale led by Rabbi Avi Weiss , and known as the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale , or the Bayit . But Riverdale is too far from her home to walk , so she goes to the Conservative Synagogue on Fifth Avenue on Shabbat and other Jewish holy days , and to the Avi Weiss synagogue on weekdays , where congregants have made Links of Love crocheted multicolored necklace strands to give to evacuees in Israel.Fern brought 100 of these necklaces with her to distribute to evacuees in the hotels where she and Leslie stayed . The congregants also made gifts for soldiers and families of hostages.Jews all over New York want to do something for Israel , said Fern , who is thinking of leading another food and fashion tour , if she can persuade people to shake off their fear of coming to Israel.Meanwhile , she wants to make contact with the Kadar Foundation which late last year sought to promote awareness of the plight of the Israeli hostages with bouquets of hope made up of yellow flowers . The project , which began in Hostage Square in Tel Aviv , spread to the United States , where proceeds from sales are transferred directly to the families of the hostages . Fern believes that if she and Avraham Kadar put their heads together , they can come up with some more awareness-raising initiatives.October 7 families speak outBeing famous is no guarantee that members of the government will come to your side in a time of trouble . Soccer commentator Shlomo Scharf , in an interview with Shalom Kital on KAN Reshet Bet radio , mentioned that after his granddaughter was murdered by Hamas on October 7 , not a single member of the government came to pay a condolence call . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s a terrible thing when a grandparent has to bury a grandchild , & rdquo ; said the former soccer player , coach of the national team , and the coach who led Maccabi Haifa to three championships.Meanwhile , he has donated an ambulance to the Haifa Home for Holocaust survivors , to be used free of charge whenever one of the residents requires hospitalization . He is also a regular visitor to the home , assisting its residents with their various needs.Celebrations with the Baha'i community&nbsp;Like many other movements , organizations , and institutions , the Baha&rsquo;i International Community , which last week celebrated its new year and the coming of spring , debated what kind of celebration it should have this year in view of the circumstances , or whether it should have a celebration at all , said David Rutstein the BIC secretary-general.In the final analysis , it was decided to go ahead , but on a somewhat lower key than usual . This was evident both in the floral decorations and in the musical entertainment.In past years , mini gardens have been established in the lobby leading to the banquet room at the David Citadel Hotel in Jerusalem , where the BIC always celebrates its new year or Nowruz , as it is called in Persian.This year , the floral creations were subdued and consisted of two garden patches , each with a large yellow centerpiece to symbolize the hoped-for return of the hostages.There appeared to be more guests than in years gone by , including Russian Ambassador Anatoly Viktorov , who , socially speaking , has paid the price for his president&rsquo;s folly . He could not have known of the tragedy that would strike his country the following day.Following the terrorist attack in a Moscow concert hall , President Herzog called Viktorov to offer his condolences to the families of the dead , and sincere wishes to all the wounded for a speedy recovery.Herzog condemned in the strongest terms the barbaric terrorist attack perpetrated in Moscow , and emphasized that terrorism of any kind , especially jihadist terrorism , indiscriminately targets all peoples , of all beliefs and religions , while sowing fear and destruction.Fighting terrorism is a major international challenge , and the countries of the world must fight it together , he said.Chefs at the David Citadel outdid themselves in presentation and flavor . A piquant mullet was reminiscent of highly spiced chraime , and the poached salmon with a semi sweet sauce was delicious . The colorful fruit platters with a rich assortment of top-quality fruits were a feast to both the eye and the palate . There was also a variety of meat dishes for carnivores , but vegetarians and some of the people who had abstained from eating during the day , during the Fast of Esther , avoided the meat for fear that it might be too difficult to digest after a fast.BIC deputy secretary-general Ariane Sabet explained that the new year falls at the beginning of spring , which is the season of renewal , the season in which there is less darkness and more light.Representing the government was Eyal Sisso , the director-general of the Population and Immigration Authority , who was born and raised in Haifa , where he frequently visited the Baha&rsquo;i Gardens . Commenting on the & ldquo;strong and important relations between Baha&rsquo;i and Israel , & rdquo ; he said that he is happy to welcome Baha&rsquo;i volunteers from around the world to Israel.Underscoring the difficulty of celebrating while the hostages are still suffering in captivity , Sisso said : & ldquo;We pray daily for their return . & rdquo;Several of the Baha&rsquo;i volunteers wore the national costumes of their respective countries.Singing with soldiersAmong Israel's most popular community singers is Einat Sarouf , who in her youth was a great fan of Yaffa Yarkoni , who she says remains her source of inspiration , and she will be playing Yarkoni in a Habima musical during the summer.Meanwhile , before she figuratively steps into Yarkoni&rsquo;s shoes , she has been singing to and with the troops and civilians in the same manner as Yarkoni , who died in January 2012.She has also been traveling to America to raise the morale of Jewish communities and Israeli expatriates . Israelis living in New York and Miami have turned up in droves to her concerts there , and , according to interviews Sarouf has given to the Israeli media , some actually weep over the line in the national anthem declaring that our hope is not yet lost . It&rsquo;s a line that applies perfectly to the present situation.Dermer speaks on roleStrategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer posted on X ( formerly Twitter ) : & ldquo;When I was Israel&rsquo;s ambassador to Washington , I must have met more than 160 other ambassadors . I never met the ambassador of Babylon , never met the ambassador of Imperial Rome , and I didn&rsquo;t meet the ambassador of the 1,000-year Reich . But there is an ambassador of Israel . We will survive this enemy . & rdquo;Bibi-bashing indulgences?Former US ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk , who twice served in that position , appears to be indulging in subtle Bibi-bashing ( some might consider it Israel-bashing ) via his X account . If he keeps it up , it will only serve to increase support for Netanyahu.Israelis of all stripes are permitted to indulge in Bibi bashing , but not anyone from abroad , even if that someone happens to be Jewish . It&rsquo;s something like a parent being permitted to say anything negative about his or her child , but woe betide anyone else who takes the liberty of deriding or chastising that same child . Israelis can say terrible things about Bibi , but will take a tough stand against non-Israelis who dare to do the same.Packing and sending mishloah manot&nbsp;It would be a reasonably safe bet to say that more Purim gift packages of pastries , cakes , candies , chocolates , fruit , and wine were delivered in Israel this year than the usual average . Good-hearted Israelis and people from abroad sought to bring cheer to evacuees displaced for indefinite periods from their homes , reservists in the IDF , and soldiers who have been wounded.When the ANU & ndash ; Museum of the Jewish People came up with an idea to involve its friends&rsquo ; organizations in Israel , the US , and elsewhere in an initiative that would cater to all the aforementioned categories , expectations were that sufficient funds would be raised for a few hundred gift parcels . In the final analysis , 2,100 gift packages or mishloah manot , as they&rsquo;re called in Hebrew , were distributed by museum employees to patients in hospitals from Jerusalem to Beersheba , as well as to displaced persons in hotels around the country.The initiative was in partnership with Foodish , the culinary unit of the museum , which baked pastries and prepared other food items , and made sure to purchase ingredients from reservists in the food industry.Foodish CEO Merav Oren said that such enthusiasm had not been anticipated , but she was delighted with this.Freed Israeli hostage speaks out&nbsp;Last week at the United Nations Human Rights Council , B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith International , the B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith World Center-Jerusalem , and B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith&rsquo;s Office of United Nations Affairs facilitated remarks by freed Israeli hostage Aviva Siegel , whose husband , Keith , remains in Hamas captivity in Gaza , and Ofri Bibas , whose multiple family members have remained captive for more than five months . Among them are her brother Yarden , sister-in-law Shiri , and nephews Ariel ( four years old ) and Kfir , who was eight months old when abducted from his home.Siegel , a 62-year-old resident of Kibbutz Kfar Aza who was liberated in November after more than 50 days in captivity , has spoken publicly of Hamas&rsquo;s sexual abuse and other acts of violence against civilians kidnapped during the terrorists&rsquo ; unprecedented rampage in southern areas of Israel on October 7.In addition to Ofri Bibas&rsquo;s close relatives still held hostage , some if not all of whom are separated and all incommunicado , Ariel and Kfir&rsquo;s grandparents Margit and Yossi , also of kibbutz Nir Oz , were burned alive.In her video statement to the UNHRC , Siegel said : & ldquo;We were taken from our home in Kfar Aza in a brutal way . We were shot at , pushed . Keith was hurt & ndash ; he got shot , and they broke his ribs . & ldquo;During the time in captivity , we had no rights . We received no food , no water , and no medical attention . We had no basic human rights . Underground , in the tunnels , we lost our right to speak , to feel , and , almost , to breathe . Keith is still there & ndash ; hurt , starved , and without any rights . It&rsquo;s our duty as humans to get him out of there . He needs his rights back . He needs his family . We need Keith to come back . I beg you to help us : bring Keith home now . & rdquo;In her video statement , Ofri Bibas said , & ldquo;My brother Yarden was abducted , wounded , from his home in Nir Oz , Israel , after trying to protect his family from Hamas terrorists . Still , the terrorists abducted his wife , Shiri , and two children & ndash ; four-year-old Ariel and Kfir , an eight-and-a-half-month-old baby . & ldquo;They are still held captive & ndash ; by the same terrorist group that burned alive Ariel and Kfir&rsquo;s grandparents , Margit and Yossi , and widely murdered , tortured , and raped civilians . According to testimonies , they continue to do so to the hostages . & ldquo;Human rights are based on freedom , life , and security . What about my family&rsquo;s rights ? Where are the UN&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s and women&rsquo;s organizations and human rights organizations ? Why haven&rsquo;t I heard your cry ? & rdquo;She concluded , & ldquo;I plead to the world and Human Rights Council & ndash ; put an end to our suffering , to the suffering of all the hostages , to the crimes against humanity . Speak out against the existence on our planet of this terror organization . Free the hostages . & rdquo;Steven Spielberg's remarks on rising radicalization and intolerance&nbsp;Honored this week by the University of Southern California , in recognition of his work with the USC Shoah Foundation , which he founded in 1994 , filmmaker Steven Spielberg , who has featured the Holocaust and the murder of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics among his best productions , said & ldquo;the echoes of history are unmistakable in our current climate .

2021-08-04 20:48:57.887,jpost,"Only 40 % of Israelis support a two-state resolution to the conflict with the Palestinians , even though it remains the most popular choice , according to a poll conducted by the Israel Democracy Institute . & nbsp ; Past IDI polls on this question have shown that Israeli support for two states has fluctuated widely over the past 28 years since the signing of the 1993 Oslo I Accord in Washington . & nbsp ; Past polls on this topic by IDI show that support for a two-state resolution peaked at 70 % in 2007 during the Annapolis peace process brokered by former president George W . Bush between former prime minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas . & nbsp ; It was at its lowest point in 1995 with only 36.9 % support , based on IDI data . & nbsp ; From July 27 to 29 , the IDI polled 750 Israelis over the age of 18 by phone and over the Internet , including 151 Arabic-speakers . The margin of error is 3.59 % for the poll on a wide array of topics , including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . & nbsp ; Participants were asked if they would back a & ldquo;two-state solution with the establishment of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Israeli-Arabs were much more likely to support a two-state resolution than their Jewish peers . & nbsp ; Out of the 39.7 % who said they found such a resolution to the conflict acceptable , 33.8 % were Jewish Israelis and 68.8 % were Israeli-Arabs . & nbsp ; That answer flipped when it came to the 48 % of Israelis who opposed it , of which 53.6 % were Jewish and 20.5 % Arab . & nbsp ; The poll was conducted in the absence of any peace process , with the United States and Israel appearing to prefer maintaining the status quo for the moment . & nbsp ; According to the IDI poll , out of the 37.1 % of Israelis who support maintenance of the status quo , 41.5 % were Jewish-Israelis and 15.4 % were Israeli-Arabs . & nbsp ; Similarly , Israeli-Arabs were more likely to oppose the status quo , with 69.5 % finding it unacceptable compared to the 37.2 % of Israeli Jews finding it acceptable . Overall , 42.6 % of those polled disapproved of the status quo . & nbsp ; The least popular option was a one-state idea . Participants were asked whether they would back a & ldquo;one-state solution incorporating both Israeli and Palestinian territories in which Israelis and Palestinians are treated as equal citizens , & rdquo ; implying a country that was no longer intended to be an ethnic nationalist democracy for either Israelis or Palestinians . & nbsp ; That idea received only 21.1 % support among Israelis and 64.2 % opposition . Some 71.1 % of Israeli Jews found a one-state idea unacceptable , and only 14.1 % found it acceptable . & nbsp ; A majority of Israeli-Arabs favored it , with 56.1 % backing it , compared to the 29.5 % who dismissed it . & nbsp ; The poll was conducted within the context of the Israeli Voice Index published by the Viterbi Family Center for Public Opinion and Policy Research . & nbsp ; IDI researcher Or Anabi clarified that while there is a drop in support for the two-state solution , it is hard to look at it comparatively over time , because IDI often asks the question in different ways , which impacts the results . & nbsp ; It is also possible that the lack of support could correlate to the absence of a peace process , Anabi explained . & nbsp ; People respond differently to concrete events as opposed to theoretical ones , he said . Initial polls showed low support for a Sinai withdrawal , Anabi said , but the moment former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat landed in Israel , the attitudes changed .","with only 40 % support , israelis still think 2 states best option - poll"
2024-03-13 02:30:10.467,jpost,"Love struck Rusalka ( soprano Alla Vasilevitsky ) meets a handsome prince ( tenor Alexei Dolgov ) in the same-titled opera by Czech composer Anton&iacute;n Dvor&aacute;k , now offered at the Israeli Opera.Sadly , she is a mermaid and he is a human . When she attempts to touch him , he thinks she is a wave in a pool . To leave her realm , Rusalka trades with the witch woman Jezibaba ( mezzo-soprano Edna Prochnik ) , exchanging her voice for legs.Will the prince see how much she loves him when she is mute , and she will gain a human soul , or will he reject this pale , sad , silent woman and condemn her to change again & ndash ; this time to a murdering bog spirit?Delighting opera fans for over 100 yearsThis much beloved opera , with its mythical and folk aspects , has delighted opera fans since its world premiere in 1901 . Director Stefano Poda has adapted it in a visually stunning , powerful manner . More conventional adaptations & ndash ; like the 1977 Czech film by Peter Weigl , or the 2017 Met Opera production directed by Sir Mark Elder & ndash ; have characters move on stage from forest pool to palace and back as if in a fairy tale ; Poda floods the stage and makes it an actual pool.When Rusalka&rsquo;s father , the water spirit Vodnik ( baritone Ionut Pascu ) emerges , he rises from that pool . The element of water is massive . The nymphs lay down and roll around Vodnik , unable to rise since , in this mythic logic , they don&rsquo;t have feet . Pascus is able to sing beautifully , inhabits the role of the grieving father who laments the loss of his daughter to the human realm , and jumps to the pool without missing a beat . Good opera is hard ; to sing submerged in water is an Olympian feat.Starring in the title role , Vasilevitsky offered a wonderful performance from start to finish . It was a delight to watch her interact with Prochnik in the role of Jezibaba.Poda&rsquo;s vision had the witch walk with a collection of iron items attached to her dark dress . When she tears a dagger and offers it to a distressed Rusalka , encouraging her to murder her prince , we sense that Jezibaba is reliving a past trauma of her own.This is implied by her strong insistence that Rusalka is motivated only by desire , and the witch&rsquo;s taunts that the prince&rsquo;s & ldquo;kissy-kisses&rdquo ; were not what the mermaid - turned-human expected . Rusalka , who actually wants a soul , pretends the witch is wise and all-knowing to get her to help.One of the few major world operas performed in Czech , Jezibaba often speaks in a diminutive form . When she says to Rusalka & ldquo;by the devil you will have feet , & rdquo ; what she is actually saying is & ldquo;by the devil you will have footsie-wussies to walk with . & rdquo ; Prochnik&rsquo;s performance of the aria & ldquo;Cury mury fuk&rdquo ; ( roughly translated as & ldquo;abracadabra&rdquo ; ) during the potion-making scene was outstanding.A gargantuan production , some things were lost due to its grandeur . When Jezibaba meets the hunter ( baritone Oded Reich ) and the kitchen apprentice ( mezzo soprano Rona Shrira ) , they are meant to be scared of her . It is very difficult to convince the audience they are frightened if they were told to collect plastic bags from the water pool and keep on singing when a scary , evil witch is speaking with them.Like Rusalka , who gave her voice in exchange for a shot at a human soul and true love , this production traded some of the familiar aspects of this opera to gift the audience with a larger-than-life production many will remember with deep gratitude for years to come.Anton&iacute;n Dvor&aacute;k&rsquo;s & lsquo;Rusalka&rsquo ; will perform daily until Thursday , March 14 , at 8 p.m . & ndash ; except for one Friday performance on March 15 , given at 1 p.m .

2022-01-13 19:35:00.480,jpost,"The Palestinian Authority and several Palestinian factions said on Thursday that they see the recent tensions in the Negev as part of Israeli measures against & ldquo;all Palestinians , & rdquo ; including the Arab citizens of Israel . Voicing full support for the Bedouin citizens of the Negev , the PA and the Palestinian factions called for stepping up the protests against Israel&rsquo;s practices . The tensions erupted this week when Bedouin citizens protested the planting of trees by Keren Kayemeth LeIsrael-Jewish National Fund on disputed lands in the Negev . According to the Palestinians , the tree-planting in the Negev comes in the context of Israel&rsquo;s & ldquo;settlement policy&rdquo ; and & ldquo;crimes&rdquo ; in the West Bank , Jerusalem and Gaza Strip . The PA and the Palestinian factions refer to the Arab Israelis , including the Bedouin , as & ldquo;Palestinians&rdquo ; or & ldquo;the Arabs of 1948 . & rdquo ; Some of the factions called on the Bedouin citizens to launch an intifada ( uprising ) in protest of the Israeli attempts to confiscate & ldquo;Arab-owned lands . & rdquo ; & ldquo;The crimes of the occupation state in the Negev are an extension of it war on the Palestinians , & rdquo ; the PA Foreign Ministry said in a statement . & ldquo;The ministry strongly condemns the heinous crime committed by the occupation state against the Palestinian Arabs of the Negev and their lands and properties . This is a continuation of the war waged by Israel to destroy the future of Palestinian generations and force them to emigrate in order to replace them with settlers . The Palestinian people in the State of Palestine are paying a heavy price as a result of the same policy . & rdquo ; Rouhi Fattouh , a senior official with the ruling Fatah faction , on Thursday condemned the & ldquo;crimes&rdquo ; of Israel in the Negev . Fattouh accused Israel of working towards expelling the Bedouin from the Negev and seizing their lands . & ldquo;Our Palestinian people everywhere stand with our people in the Negev and support their steadfastness , & rdquo ; he said . The PLO&rsquo;s Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ( PFLP ) also likened the Israeli measures in the Negev to the ongoing tensions between the Palestinians , IDF soldiers and settlers in the West Bank . The PFLP praised the Bedouin citizens for & ldquo;rising up in rejection of [ Israel&rsquo;s ] decision to confiscate their lands in favor of settlement projects . & rdquo ; The PFLP called for & ldquo;uniting all efforts to confront this new project , which is a repetition of what happened with our people in Khan al-Ahmar . & rdquo ; KHAN AL-AHMAR is a Bedouin village located near Ma&rsquo;aleh Adumim . In 2018 , the High Court of Justice ruled that the village can be evicted because it was illegally constructed , a move that triggered a crisis and international outcry and resulted in the postponement of the demolition . The PFLP called for a & ldquo;heroic response&rdquo ; of the Bedouin citizens in the Negev to Israel&rsquo;s alleged plan to seize their lands . It also called on the Bedouin citizens not to serve in the IDF . & ldquo;We call on the masses of our people to mobilize and participate widely in the demonstrations of anger that will start today [ Thursday ] and tomorrow [ Friday ] in the villages and towns of the occupied Negev , & rdquo ; the PFLP said . Maher Mezher , member of the PFLP Politburo , said what is happening in the Negev is in the context of the & ldquo;clash between all Palestinians and the occupation . & rdquo ; Mezher told the Palestinian Quds Network website the Israeli & ldquo;crimes in the Negev are a continuation of the frenzied onslaught of settlements and Judaization in Jerusalem and the West Bank , in addition to the siege of the Gaza Strip . & rdquo ; Hamas also accused Israel of seeking to & ldquo;Judaize&rdquo ; the Negev . & ldquo;The increase in Zionist policies to confiscate Palestinian lands through the so-called Jewish National Fund confirms once again that the policy of ethnic cleansing launched by the Zionist movement still governs the mentality of the Zionist entity , & rdquo ; said Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem . He too urged the Bedouin in the Negev to step up their protests & ldquo;to consolidate the Arab-Palestinian identity of the occupied territories . & rdquo ; Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) official Ahmed al-Mudalal said the Bedouin in the Negev and the Palestinians in the West Bank , Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem are in a & ldquo;state of confrontation with the occupation . & rdquo ; & ldquo;What is happening in the Negev is a crime against our people , & rdquo ; the PIJ official said . & ldquo;The Zionist enemy is committing the crime of ethnic cleansing against our people in the occupied Negev and trying to impose its Zionist agenda on all the Palestinian lands . & rdquo ; Mudalal claimed that the & ldquo;victory achieved by the Palestinian resistance&rdquo ; during last year&rsquo;s war between Israel and Hamas & ldquo;restored unity to the Palestinian people in all places of their existence . & rdquo ; PIJ spokesperson Tareq Ezz al-Din said there was & ldquo;no difference&rdquo ; between the Negev , Jerusalem and the West Bank . & ldquo;What is happening in the Negev is happening in [ the east Jerusalem neighborhood of ] Sheikh Jarrah and [ the West Bank village of ] Beita , & rdquo ; Ezz al-Din told Quds Network . & ldquo;The Palestinian factions and people must escalate the resistance in all its forms , first and foremost the armed struggle [ against Israel ] . & rdquo ;","palestinians decry israeli ‘ crimes ’ in negev , urge bedouins to revolt"
2024-05-14 10:54:08.507,jpost,"Friday , May 14 , 1948 . The final hours of the British Mandate in Palestine ticked away . The mandate was set to expire at midnight . David Ben-Gurion gave orders for the ceremony to mark the birth of the Jewish state . He decided to make the historic declaration just before Shabbat came in.In the fevered atmosphere of the time , Ben-Gurion’s overriding concern was security . If the location of the ceremony became public knowledge , a single terrorist bomb could wipe out the entire embryonic government of the new state , together with most of its notables . So it was not until the middle of that Friday morning that officials began telephoning the 200 people who had been selected to attend the ceremony . Only then were they told that it was to take place in Tel Aviv’s Municipal Museum on Rothschild Boulevard , at exactly 4 p.m.Another 50 or so people also received a call that morning , instructing them to be present – the members of what was then known as the Palestine Philharmonic Orchestra , comprised of Jewish musicians – for by 1948 the national orchestra had become so identified with the Jewish people that an occasion of such historic significance was unthinkable without their presence.ON MAY 15 , 1948 , the orchestra became the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra ( IPO ) , and its relationship with the people of Israel has a deserved place in the reflections about nationhood , identity , and independence that mark Independence Day.As the National Council and the guests made their way to the ground floor area , the orchestra assembled in the museum’s upper gallery . At exactly 4 p.m . , Ben-Gurion rapped his gavel . This was the prearranged signal for the orchestra to strike up “ Hatikvah . ” Unfortunately , someone missed the cue , and from above came only silence . Never one to lack initiative , Ben-Gurion promptly launched his uncertain voice into the anthem ; rather raggedly , the other members of the People’s Council joined in.But someone in the hall did respond to that gavel – a young radio engineer , Ralf Hellinger , who had been running the underground radio station of the Hagana , the clandestine Jewish self-defense force . Tipped off by American journalists about what was to take place , Hellinger had arrived at the Tel Aviv museum that afternoon carting two of his cumbersome 78 rpm recording machines . After proclaiming the new State , Ben-Gurion invited the members of the People’s Council , one by one , to sign the document . As the last one put his name on the scroll , to thunderous applause , the orchestra finally made its presence known , and brought the proceedings to a close with “ Hatikvah . ” The audio recordings of the events of that historic Friday afternoon have been preserved in the archives of the Israel Public Broadcasting Corporation , which today operates under the brand name Kan . When the musicians assembled at the Municipal Museum that Friday afternoon , they did so as the Palestine Philharmonic Orchestra . By the time they played “ Hatikvah ” they had become the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra ( IPO ) . Give or take a few months , the orchestra itself was 12 years old by that time . How had it come into existence ? IN THE early 1930s , Germany’s increasingly harsh race laws roused the eminent violinist , Bronislaw Huberman , to a fury . In articles and letters to the newspapers , he berated German intellectuals for failing to make a stand for freedom of cultural expression ; and tried to mobilize world opinion against the Nazis ’ persecution of Jewish writers , artists , and musicians . Finally , Huberman decided to do something practical to help those of his own profession who were being denied the right to perform inside the Third Reich . He began to persuade first-rank Jewish musicians to emigrate to the Land of Israel , known then as Palestine . Against all the odds , he succeeded in setting up a viable orchestra , largely comprised of immigrant musicians . Even more remarkably , Huberman was able to persuade Arturo Toscanini , possibly the most eminent conductor in the world at that time , to conduct the opening concert of the orchestra . “ I am doing this for humanity , ” the maestro declared.The Unfinished by Franz Schubert ( 1797-1828 ) was one of the two major works included in that first public performance by the orchestra on December 26 , 1936 . Present were the British high commissioner Lord Peel , Vera and Chaim Weizmann , Paula and David Ben-Gurion , and a vast audience , which included Signora Toscanini . The first years were not easy . Not only had the 75 players brought a wide diversity of styles with them , but the diversity of languages added further difficulties . Despite the problems , they quickly coalesced into an orchestra that renowned conductors were happy to lead , among others Bernardino Molinari ( 1880-1952 ) , William Steinberg ( 1889-1978 ) , and even Britain’s distinguished Malcolm Sargent ( 1895-1967 ) . The version of “ Hatikvah ” currently used by the orchestra is based on the orchestration by Sargent in those early days.While recognized remarkably early as a first-class orchestra , the Israel Philharmonic is today world-class . This transformation was due to two towering figures in its history – famed conductors Leonard Bernstein and Zubin Mehta . The first a Jew , the latter a gentile , these two men share equal credit for forging the unique symbiosis between the orchestra and the people of Israel that is the outstanding characteristic of the IPO . No other top-flight orchestra in the world is so closely identified with its constituency as the Israel Philharmonic . City orchestras in the United States , the United Kingdom , Europe ; national orchestras in the Netherlands , Switzerland , and elsewhere , none are woven , as the IPO is , into the very fabric of their audience’s lives . Where the Israeli people have gone , there has been the orchestra , giving musical expression to the great events in the nation’s story.BERNSTEIN ARRIVED in Israel in October 1948 to open the first orchestral season in the State of Israel . The season included six special concerts for service men and women – the most spectacular in the town of Beersheba just captured from Egyptian troops . Braving bad roads , sand and dust , the orchestra traveled from Tel Aviv with their own piano and played their concert on a makeshift stage before a thousand-strong audience of troops.That November , Bernstein broadcast from Israel to the United States . “ Last week , ” he said , “ we gave a concert in Jerusalem for soldiers only . Imagine 2,000 soldiers simultaneously given leave one morning in a city under siege ! “ Imagine them crowding into the Edison Theatre , filling every nook , suspended literally from the roof , curled up on window sashes , packed into the aisles and staircases – all to hear a Brahms symphony . “ And at the end , the shouting and screaming was an almost unbearable tribute . Yes , the orchestra is the lifeblood of Israeli culture , and I am dedicated to the task of seeing it flourish . ” That was a commitment Bernstein honored to the full , in the years that followed.An unforgettable concert during the Six Day WarTOWARD THE end of May 1967 , with Israel’s Arab neighbors mobilizing on her borders , the distinguished foreign conductor , who had been engaged for the summer concert series , took fright and hurriedly departed . In the middle of the six days of fighting that began on June 5 , Mehta arrived from Europe in a plane otherwise filled with ammunition , joining Daniel Barenboim and Jacqueline du Pré who were already performing with the orchestra . Close on their heels came Sir John Barbirolli and Bernstein.In July , with Jerusalem once again united , an unforgettable concert was staged in the amphitheater on Mount Scopus . In the warm summer afternoon , before a packed audience that included then-prime minister Levi Eshkol and former prime minister Ben-Gurion , Bernstein conducted a performance of Mahler’s Resurrection symphony that lives in the memory of those present as an almost unbearably moving experience.By this time , Mehta’s connection with the IPO was strong , forged in his first season with the orchestra in 1961 . “ When I came on to the stage for the second rehearsal , ” he once recalled , “ the players applauded . ” How a musician from India , coming to this group of Jewish musicians assembled from around the world , managed to ignite so extraordinary and lasting a chemistry is something of a mystery . Mehta himself sometimes ascribes it to the fact that he was a member of the Persian “ Parsi ” minority in his own country , although , he always adds : “ The Parsis have never experienced racism like the Jews . ” In the heady days that followed the Six Day War – days that saw the marriage of Barenboim and du Pré in Jerusalem – Mehta alternated with Bernstein in conducting the IPO in a series of victory concerts . The opening of the 1968-69 season coincided with the announcement of Mehta’s appointment as musical director of the IPO , an appointment extended for life in 1981 . “ I will stay for as long as the players want me , ” declared maestro Mehta , in accepting the honor.It was under his directorship that the IPO achieved acknowledged world-class status . He melded the rich string sound that comes so naturally to European musicians with the special qualities of brass and woodwind that flourish in the United States . Mehta provided the inspired leadership that united a body of musicians into a musical instrument that is greater than its parts . Above all , he cherished and fostered the unique relationship that has existed from the first between the orchestra and the people of Israel . Under the Indian Mehta’s baton , the IPO was transformed into the musical expression of the Israeli nation’s very identity . ",76 years of the israel philharmonic orchestra

2024-05-04 10:16:04.333,jpost,"Everything about the movie June Zero , which opened in theaters throughout Israel on May 2 , is unusual.This includes the fact that the director and co-writer of this quintessentially Israel movie , which tells several stories connected to the building of the oven that was used to cremate Adolf Eichmann after his execution in 1962 , is an American : Jake Paltrow , and yes , he&rsquo;s Gwyneth&rsquo;s brother.Paltrow has made several previous films , including the excellent 2007 The Good Night , about a man who wants to achieve in his dreams what he couldn&rsquo;t accomplish while awake , starring Gwyneth Paltrow , Penelope Cruz , Danny DeVito , and Martin Freeman.Paltrow , whose late father , the director , Bruce Paltrow , was Jewish , became interested in the stories surrounding the Eichmann trial , especially concerning the fate of Eichmann&rsquo;s body , and began researching them in detail . Deciding that for the sake of authenticity , any movie about this topic would have to be in Hebrew and needed a screenwriter who was an Israeli native , he brought on director Tom Shoval , who made the movies Youth and Shake Your Cares Away , to collaborate with him on the screenplay.June Zero presents three stories that are connected thematically and create a vivid portrait of the diversity of life in Israel in the early & rsquo;60s . We know that Eichmann , the notorious Nazi commander who was responsible for implementing the Final Solution and causing the deaths of millions of Jews , was hanged outside a Ramla prison on June 1 , 1962 . & nbsp;However , people forget that he spent about two years in Israel , as investigators interrogated him before the trial , during his trial , and in the period of appeals that followed the trial . There was a great fear on the part of the government & ndash ; a justified fear & ndash ; that a concentration camp survivor might assassinate him as revenge for the murders of their families . Since the vast majority of Holocaust victims were Ashkenazim , only Mizrahi police were allowed to guard Eichmann , and the movie focuses on Haim ( Yoav Levi ) , his Moroccan-born main guard . & nbsp;We hear Eichmann speak and see his feet and other parts of his body & ndash ; such as his neck , in a harrowing scene when he is getting his hair cut and Haim worries that the barber will try to slit his throat & ndash ; but he is not a character in the film . Instead , we identify with Haim who faithfully carries out the bizarre task of ensuring that no harm comes to one of the most notorious war criminals in history.Other stories portrayed in the filmANOTHER STORY features David ( Noam Ovadia ) , a mischievous 13-year-old immigrant from Libya , who has been sent to work part-time in a factory run by a gruff owner ( Tzahi Grad ) . This factory is given the assignment to build an oven for cremation , a method of body disposal not used in Israel since both Jewish and Muslim religious law prohibits its use . The idea was to cremate Eichmann&rsquo;s body and scatter the ashes outside Israel&rsquo;s territorial waters , so there would be no grave that could become a spot where pro-Nazis could make pilgrimages to . For the factory and its staff , it was a race against time to create this oven that is unlike anything they have ever made before , and they are aided by David&rsquo;s boldness and by the thoroughness of a survivor ( Ami Smolarchik ) , who struggles with his memories.The third section is set in Poland , as Micha ( Tom Hagy ) , a young Holocaust survivor investigating Eichmann&rsquo;s crimes , revisits the ghetto and other sites where he and his family suffered and tells his story to visitors from abroad . There he meets a representative ( Joy Rieger ) of an Israeli delegation and the two engage in debates over how best to commemorate the Holocaust . She is critical of dwelling too long on the details of what happened , while he feels it is his mission to tell his story to the world , and for all survivors to tell their stories.In a statement released by the producers , Paltrow , who visited Israel many times to research the movie , said that he felt that it was urgent to tell stories from the Holocaust to a younger generation around the world who may not understand what really happened and that he wanted to tell stories people had not heard before . & nbsp ; & ldquo;What distinguishes this film from other Holocaust films is the examination of the subject through the most obvious physical and political consequence of the Holocaust : the State of Israel . Israel is not only a country where Holocaust survivors and their descendants live , but its diversity creates a rare mosaic of cultures and origins . The Eichmann trial was a turning point in the young country&rsquo;s understanding of the atrocities committed by the Nazis in Europe . & rdquo;While many films , both documentaries and dramas , have focused on the dramatic Eichmann trial in Jerusalem , Paltrow chose to start the movie after the end of the trial . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Our film is intended to lay the foundations for understanding the complexities of Israel , from the aftermath of the Holocaust to today . This is not the story of the survival of a people in crisis , it is the story of the identity crisis of a people after survival . And throughout it there is also laughter , there is happiness , there is sadness and tears , conflict and drama , & rdquo ; he said.Tom Shoval spoke warmly and appreciatively about collaborating with Paltrow on the screenplay . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Jake got interested in everything connected to the Eichmann trial , it was a way for him to connect to his Jewish roots and identity , it&rsquo;s something he&rsquo;s spoken about a lot . & rdquo ; Paltrow became very interested in Israel in the early & rsquo;60s , Shoval said , and after he read an article about the building of the oven , he knew it would be the centerpiece of the film.PALTROW WAS visiting Israel to work on pre-production for the film when the COVID pandemic broke out , and he was stuck in Israel for a few weeks . He and Shoval used the time to fine-tune the script . Paltrow even filed paperwork to emigrate to Israel so that he could stay in the country to keep working . & ldquo;It was a long journey , filled with unexpected turns , & rdquo ; said Shoval . At first , they had planned the movie to be mainly about the building of the oven , but then they realized it needed to be a & ldquo;panorama of Israeli stories of this period . This interested us and we found so many fascinating stories , we knew we needed to include them . & rdquo;The decision to move outside of Israel and back to Poland to tell Micha&rsquo;s story was also important in their writing process . & ldquo;The movie is about memory and history , about what it is to bear witness to the past . . . Before the Eichmann trial , it wasn&rsquo;t acceptable for Holocaust survivors to tell their stories in public in Israel . . . and it was at this moment when the survivors received a kind of validation of their experience . It was a turning point and we wanted to show a character who experiences this as part of the film . & rdquo;The wealth of stories they discovered & ldquo;made it possible for us to present a varied wide-ranging portrait of Israel , to show the Ashkenazim and the Mizrahim , the secular and religious , the Jews and the Arabs , the survivors and those who weren&rsquo;t in the Holocaust , and how it all came together in this story . . . & rdquo ; said Shoval . & ldquo;It&rsquo;s a story that hasn&rsquo;t been told before , and it was important to us to tell it . & rdquo ;",' june zero ' : an obscure story about eichmann in israel after the trial

The Israeli military did not immediately give details of what set them off.In their worst hostilities since a 2006 war , the Iran-backed Hezbollah and Israel traded fire for weeks across the border after the Hamas-Israel war erupted on Oct . 7 . Mirroring the situation in the Gaza Strip , the hostilities ceased last week when Hamas and Israel agreed a truce that expired on Friday .

2021-05-20 20:49:14.703,jpost,"& nbsp;Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told US and European Union officials this week that he is ready to return to the negotiating table with Israel under the umbrella of the Quartet , which , in addition to the Americans and Europeans , also consists of Russia and the United Nations . & nbsp ; On Wednesday , Abbas repeated his readiness to resume the stalled peace process with Israel during a speech before the Arab Parliament , the legislative body of the Arab League . & nbsp ; Abbas&rsquo;s talk about reviving the peace process came amid the war that erupted last week between Israel and Hamas . Abbas&rsquo;s remarks came in the context of his efforts to show the Americans and Europeans that he is as relevant as ever and that they should look forward to working with him , especially regarding any future peace process with Israel . & nbsp ; Abbas , in other words , was sending a message to everyone , including the Palestinians and Arabs , that he remains the one and only address for any arrangements or agreements concerning the Palestinians and the conflict with Israel . He felt the need to send this message as his rivals in Hamas were negotiating with UN , Egyptian , Qatari , Turkish and other officials around the world ways of reaching a ceasefire with Israel . & nbsp ; THE 85-YEAR-OLD Abbas has always been known as someone who likes to be the center of attention . He enjoys making a drama out of anything that upsets him . He also seems to relish the thought of keeping everyone in suspense regarding his future moves , just as he did when he announced & ndash ; and later delayed & ndash ; the Palestinian parliamentary and presidential elections , which were supposed to take place on May 22 and July 31 , respectively . & nbsp ; Abbas&rsquo;s decision in late April to postpone the elections put the spotlight on him again , even though he received a lot of negative coverage in the Arab and Western media for using Jerusalem as a pretext to call off the vote . But in this case , Abbas seems to be going along with the famous quote : & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what the newspapers say about me as long as they spell my name right . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Abbas , however , did not foresee the consequences of his decision to delay the elections and blame Israel for hindering the vote . His accusations against Israel , particularly surrounding the controversy over the participation of Jerusalem&rsquo;s Arab residents in the Palestinian elections , are seen by Palestinian political analysts as one of the factors that contributed to the eruption of violence in the city . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The president did not expect that his statements would add fuel to the fire , & rdquo ; said political analyst Ghassan Abu Omar . & ldquo;Worse , he did not expect the demonstrations , which began in Jerusalem and later spread to the West Bank , to turn into pro-Hamas rallies . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Indeed , Hamas was successful in its effort to take advantage of the violence on the streets of Jerusalem to further bolster its standing among the Palestinian public . Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip were rubbing their hands with glee as they watched thousands of Palestinians in Jerusalem and the West Bank raise Hamas flags and chant : & ldquo;We are all the men of [ Hamas military wing commander ] Mohammed Deif ! & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Buoyed by these scenes , Hamas decided to take the risk of firing rockets at Jerusalem during the Jerusalem Day celebration as part of the Gaza-based terrorist group&rsquo;s effort to present itself as the & ldquo;defender&rdquo ; of the city and al-Aqsa Mosque . Apparently , Hamas was expecting a limited response from Israel , one that would perhaps lead to only a few hours of fighting . & nbsp ; The rockets that Hamas launched at Jerusalem were directed not only against Israel , but against Abbas , too . The rockets were meant to show the Palestinian public , as well as all Arabs and Muslims , that while Hamas was prepared to attack Israel to & ldquo;deter&rdquo ; it from evicting Arab families from the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah , Abbas was doing nothing to stop the Israeli & ldquo;aggression . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;The Hamas attacks on Israel made Abbas look very bad , & rdquo ; remarked a veteran Palestinian journalist from Nablus . & ldquo;In the eyes of the Palestinian people , Hamas became the heroes , while Abbas was continuing to conduct security coordination with Israel , making him appear as a traitor . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; To avoid a damaging loss of face , Abbas and his ruling Fatah faction leaders joined calls for a & ldquo;day of rage&rdquo ; earlier this week in protest of Israel&rsquo;s military strikes on the Gaza Strip . Senior Fatah leaders such as Mahmoud al-Aloul were even sent to participate in demonstrations against Israel in some parts of the West Bank . Fatah activists in Ramallah and other Palestinian cities tried to turn the protests into pro-Abbas rallies , but to no avail . & nbsp ; Moreover , masked gunmen belonging to Fatah&rsquo;s military wing , al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades , appeared on the streets of some Palestinian cities in the West Bank to issue threats against Israel . This move was part of a desperate effort by the Fatah leadership to counter the numerous appearances of masked commanders and spokesmen of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad during the past week . It was Fatah&rsquo;s way of telling the Palestinian public that the faction has not abandoned the armed struggle against Israel . & nbsp ; In his speech before the Arab Parliament on Wednesday , Abbas said that he was still working to set a new date for the parliamentary and presidential elections . He is also reported to have relayed the same message to US envoy Hady Amr and EU officials with whom he met during the past week . & nbsp ; If true , this message proves that Abbas has completely lost touch with reality . Any elections that are held under the current circumstances would be disastrous for Abbas&rsquo;s Fatah , given Hamas&rsquo;s rising popularity among the Palestinians in the aftermath of the latest round of fighting with Israel . & nbsp ; Hamas leaders are already claiming & ldquo;victory&rdquo ; for firing thousands of rockets and missiles into Israel and forcing millions of Israelis into bomb shelters . & nbsp ; They are also taking credit for damaging relations between Jews and Arabs inside Israel and allegedly forcing Israel to & ldquo;scale down&rdquo ; its measures in Jerusalem , including the suspension of visits by Jews to the Temple Mount , the removal of security barriers at the Old City&rsquo;s Damascus Gate and the postponement of a court decision to evict the Arab families from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah . & nbsp ; These & ldquo;achievements&rdquo ; will be added to the fact that , as in previous rounds of hostilities , the latest fighting did not end Hamas&rsquo;s rule over the Gaza Strip . Hamas may have suffered severe blows due to the loss of some of its senior military commanders and the massive destruction of its military facilities and terrorist infrastructure , but as long as it retains its control over the Gaza Strip , that&rsquo;s seen by its leaders and many Palestinians as a & ldquo;victory . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; This , in addition to the fact that Hamas once again succeeded in proving that despite the continued Israeli and Egyptian blockade on the Gaza Strip , it has managed to amass large amounts of rockets and missiles . & nbsp ; Needless to say , any & ldquo;victory&rdquo ; for Hamas is bad news for Abbas and Fatah . & nbsp ; & ldquo;First , Abbas lost much credibility when he delayed the elections , & rdquo ; explained Palestinian academic Marwan Abu Sbeih . & ldquo;The Gaza war drove the final nail in his coffin . No one seems to take him seriously , not even the Arab leaders . Not a single Arab head of state called President Abbas during the war to talk about the situation . The only people who were talking to him were the Americans and Europeans , who still believe that he is relevant . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; IN THE coming days and weeks , Abbas is likely to increase his efforts to return to center stage in order to show his people and the rest of the world that he remains a major player in the Palestinian arena . But the events of the past few months have shown that he has even lost control over his own Fatah faction , which was planning to run in the parliamentary elections on three separate lists . The split in Fatah and the fear of a Hamas electoral victory are believed to be the main reason behind Abbas&rsquo;s decision to delay the vote . & nbsp ; Even if the US and the EU manage to revive the peace process between the Palestinians and Israel , it&rsquo;s hard to see how Abbas would be able to return to the negotiating table amid the fragmentation in Fatah and the soaring popularity of Hamas.As a former Fatah official in Ramallah commented this week , & ldquo;If the Palestinians and Arabs no longer take this man seriously , why should anyone else , including the Israelis , Americans and Europeans , take him seriously ? & nbsp ; & ldquo;This man [ Abbas ] has divided Fatah , alienated many Palestinians and consolidated the division between the West Bank and Gaza Strip . The Palestinians need new faces , new leaders . & rdquo ;",abbas struggles to stay relevant in the israel-palestinian conflict
2021-05-15 20:55:51.350,jpost,"Hundreds of Jerusalem women have taken to social media in the name of the & ldquo;silent majority&rdquo ; to protest the violence and civil disobedience that has taken over Israel&rsquo;s mixed cities in recent days . The & ldquo;Not in My Name&rdquo ; campaign was launched Thursday night across Facebook , with images of women holding their hands up with the phrase written in Hebrew , English or Arabic . & ldquo;This was coming from an extreme desire & ndash ; after seeing image after image of violent men in the streets as the face of the internal , civil , local uprising & ndash ; and wondering if a female voice could not be a contrast to this , & rdquo ; said Ariel Markose , who helped spearhead the project . & ldquo;This was the focus of the campaign : the opposite image , the opposite message . & rdquo ; & ldquo;These people don&rsquo;t speak for me , this is not in my name , & rdquo ; she continued . & ldquo;Civil violence is not the answer , no matter what side you are on . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; A resident of Jerusalem&rsquo;s Katamonim neighborhood , Markose said the idea was sparked by a social media message posted by her friend Heftzi Zion Moses that called out the silence of the moderate majority . That post led to a phone call between the friends , along with two others & ndash ; Eliraz Shifman Bergman and Anat Shwartz Weil & ndash ; and Rachel Azaria , formerly an MK in Moshe Kahlon&rsquo;s Kulanu Party . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; & nbsp ; At first , the group envisioned a women&rsquo;s protest but realized that such an effort might get lost amid the countless other riots across Israel . Moreover , they wanted to provide a space for women with children who might feel unsafe going out to protest . The team started a WhatsApp group that in hours filled up with 300 participants ; they have now started a second one to help include more women who can share the message . The Facebook posts are in all three languages and state , & ldquo;Not in my Name ! Women of Jerusalem , from all sectors are saying not in our name . From the horrible events we are witnessing these days , we choose life and say no to violence . We call on all of you to join . This evening , together , we raise our hands to say , & lsquo;Not in my Name . & rsquo ; & rdquo ; The hashtag # NotInMyName and its Arabic and Hebrew counterparts have hundreds of posts and thousands of comments & ndash ; some supportive , others by extremists who posted death threats . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; Markose , who runs the Jerusalem Model project that brings together the city&rsquo;s diverse social activists , said that she doesn&rsquo;t know of Palestinian women who have shared the posts so far . & ldquo;In times of conflict for a Palestinian woman , expressing any political voice against violence and uprising is not a majority view and can be condemned by those around her to the point that it is scary , & rdquo ; Markose said . & ldquo;There is a tension between wanting to strike when there is momentum and making it perfectly equal and symmetrical . The value here is not symmetry . & ldquo;On the other hand , there is a strong community of local Jerusalem women who have energy and something to say , & rdquo ; she said . She added that the campaign is also apolitical and not meant to influence government policy . & ldquo;I hope we can do something great , & rdquo ; Markose concluded .","# notinmyname : hundreds of jerusalem women say @ @ @ choose life , not violence @ @ @"

2024-05-24 17:54:18.387,jpost,"There are a lot of characters & ndash ; and a lot of questions & ndash ; introduced in the early parts of the new series The 11th Body from Keshet 12 , the first episode of which premiered on Monday after the news and the second aired on Wednesday . But if you concentrate on Maggie Azerzer&rsquo;s lead performance as Iris , a troubled police detective , you can enjoy her work and trust that eventually you&rsquo;ll absorb all the details of what&rsquo;s going on.Iris is a divorced mother in Haifa . Her ex is having her investigated for faulty parenting , her father ( Gavri Banai ) is senile and is about to be kicked out of his assisted living facility because he requires too much assistance , and her sometime lover ( Hisham Suliman ) can&rsquo;t commit to her for reasons she understands but isn&rsquo;t happy about . & nbsp;She doesn&rsquo;t have too many friends at the police station where she works , because she raised complaints about other cops&rsquo ; excessive violence . Crime families of various ethnicities are hovering in the background of her professional life & ndash ; and sometimes the foreground.One morning , she has to investigate a strange call from the medical faculty at the Technion : The anatomy class has found an extra body , and no one knows where it came from . While her colleagues try to dismiss the deceased John Doe , her investigator&rsquo;s skill kicks into gear and she vows to get to the bottom of it . Azerzer is so tough as the put-upon Iris that while she isn&rsquo;t easy to like , you admire her and root for her.One footnote to the show is that , as far as I know , this is the first drama to show how wild boars have overrun parts of Haifa & ndash ; and as they pass by , a character quips : & ldquo;New neighbors ? & rdquo;IF YOU&rsquo;D rather watch a detective story in English , try The Long Goodbye on Amazon&rsquo;s Prime Video and Apple TV + , which brought together three great talents who created one of the best , most offbeat detective films of all time : Raymond Chandler , whose novel of the same name is the basis for the movie ; Robert Altman , who adapted and directed the film ; and Elliott Gould , who starred in it.Altman figured out that Chandler was made to be updated for the post-Vietnam era ( the book was published in 1953 ) , and that Gould was born to play the cynical but romantic detective-fiction hero , Philip Marlowe . The movie has a sprawling plot that mixes the glaring daylight of Los Angeles with its dark shadows , and it involves Marlowe trying to help his friend Terry ( Jim Bouton ) , who has been accused of killing his wife , and then veers off into a story about an Ernest Hemingway-type writer ( Sterling Hayden ) , who has disappeared , and his distressed wife ( Nina van Pallandt ) , who is trying to find him.The cast features a number of people who were known and/or notorious off screen , notably Bouton , an ex-baseball player who wrote a tell-all book , and van Pallandt , who became famous as the mistress of the Howard Hughes biography hoaxer Clifford Irving . & nbsp;Mark Rydell is best known as a director , and he plays a mobster mixed up in all of this , who is rather creepily portrayed as an observant Jew , and who commits the movie&rsquo;s most shocking act of violence and gets to utter the most memorable line afterwards . & nbsp;But you don&rsquo;t have to know any of this backstory to enjoy Gould&rsquo;s awkward charm and wisecracks . The movie&rsquo;s opening features one of the funniest scenes ever filmed involving a cat & ndash ; and it reveals a lot about Marlowe&rsquo;s character , too . After those first few minutes , you know him better than you know most movie heroes after an hour.Netflix's ' Mother of the Bride'NETFLIX&rsquo;S Mother of the Bride , which stars Brooke Shields , is a ( very ) watered-down version of Mamma Mia ! & ndash ; with all the elements that made that movie so successful , because it plays into a child&rsquo;s fantasy of their estranged parents getting back together.Like Mamma Mia ! , Ticket to Paradise , and so many other movies , it features a young couple holding a hastily arranged destination wedding & ndash ; in this case , it&rsquo;s in Thailand & ndash ; that throws two exes among the couple&rsquo;s parents together . You could set your watch by the predictable plot developments , but you&rsquo;ll likely watch it to the end if you start it , because it&rsquo;s an efficiently constructed entertainment machine , like a pop tune you can&rsquo;t get out of your head even if it annoys you.Mother of the Bride stars a lot of actors who , like Shields , were A-listers a while ago and haven&rsquo;t been on screen that much lately . There is an air of palpable gratitude among the cast at finding themselves back on camera . & nbsp;Shields , who , it turned out , had a flair for comedy that she demonstrated in the Suddenly Susan series over 20 year ago , plays & ldquo;world-renowned geneticist&rdquo ; Lana , a widowed control freak workaholic whose daughter , Emma ( Miranda Cosgrove , best known for the series iCarly ) , decides to marry at a beach resort after her boyfriend , RJ ( Sean Teale ) , suddenly proposes.It turns out that RJ&rsquo;s father , Will ( Benjamin Bratt , who played one of the police detectives on the early iterations of Law & amp ; Order ) , was the great love of Lana&rsquo;s life and he dumped her after college without a word . Did you guess that he is now a billionaire venture capitalist?So , by now , you have likely either started streaming the movie or stopped reading this , but if you need to know more , Michael McDonald plays Lana&rsquo;s wisecracking gay best friend , Rachael Harris is her wisecracking straight best friend , and Chad Michael Murray plays the instantly smitten doctor who briefly challenges Will for Lana&rsquo;s affections . Murray was memorable in the role of Jake , the teen dream in Freaky Friday who falls for Jamie Lee Curtis when her daughter takes over her body ( you can stream that movie on Disney + or Apple TV + ) . The tiny amount of new content in this old story is about Emma surrendering control of her wedding to a mean wedding planner in order to win & ldquo;likes&rdquo ; on Instagram & ndash ; and I won&rsquo;t be spoiling anything to reveal that Emma eventually learns the value of spending time with family and trusting her own taste . & nbsp;There is a scene where a couple falls into a pool and everyone jumps in after them , another where the exes get stranded in a picturesque location , and a credits sequence where the cast performs a dance to a pop tune .

2024-05-05 10:19:27.287,jpost,"In the wake of recent events , the necessity to learn from history and honor the memory of past atrocities has taken on renewed urgency . As the global community gears up to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day , Yad Vashem & ndash ; Israel&rsquo;s revered memorial to the victims of the Holocaust & ndash ; stands as a poignant reminder of the perils of forgetting the lessons of the past.Scheduled for Sunday evening , May 5 , the solemn State Opening Ceremony at Yad Vashem&rsquo;s Warsaw Ghetto Square holds a particular resonance . The Oct . 7 massacres , where Jews living in southern Israel were brutally attacked and murdered by genocide-driven terrorists , felt unfathomably familiar . These events rang a familiar , unnerving tone : of the presence of unwavering hate and the dire consequences that await if we choose to ignore the history of events that led up to the persecution of Jews and the Holocaust.Eclipsed only by the global trend of antisemitism , these occurrences give us cause for renewed worry and angst . College and university campuses , meant to be incubators of enlightenment and leadership , are once again being used as hotbeds for hatred and extremism . This begs the question : If our future leaders are being influenced , what kind of future is in store for Diaspora Jewry?The theme of Holocaust Remembrance Day 2024It is therefore very appropriate that at the heart of this year&rsquo;s Holocaust Remembrance Day is the theme & ldquo;A Lost World : The Destruction of the Jewish Communities . & rdquo ; A profound acknowledgment of the devastation wrought upon the fabric of Jewish life by the effects of unchecked antisemitism . The Jewish community , a unique and autonomous social unit that characterized Jewish existence in the Diaspora for centuries , was dealt a fatal blow that devastated the lives and communities of thousands of pre-war Jews , many of which had formed the very bedrock of Jewish existence.The rise of the Nazi Party and the establishment of German hegemony over Europe plunged Jewish communities into a reality of persecution and terror . The establishment of ghettos only served to further isolate entire communities , forcing these leaders to enforce Nazi decrees and assume duties formerly entrusted to governmental bodies . Finally , the ultimate campaign , the systematic extermination of Jews in Europe and North Africa , inflicted utter devastation upon thousands of communities , leaving behind a landscape of destruction and loss.While the Oct . 7 massacres dealt a blow to our nation&rsquo;s sense of security and serenity , the cruelties inflicted upon the Israeli-Jewish population did not mark another Holocaust . This nuanced reflection honors the individual lives of each tragedy.Remembrance and education lie at the heart of a remedy for this disease known as antisemitism . That is why the annual memorial ceremony broadcast across the world in five languages including Arabic is so critical . The symbolic Memorial Torch , to be lit this year by Holocaust survivor and Chairman of the Yad Vashem Council Rabbi Israel Meir Lau & ndash ; someone who epitomizes triumph of the human spirit over adversity & ndash ; must transcend into reality if we have any hope of fighting the scourge of antisemitism.Additionally , the stories of the six torch lighters & ndash ; Pninah Hefer , Allegra Gutta , Arie Eitani , Raisa Brodsky , Michael Bar-On , and Izi Kabilio & ndash ; only serve to make the enormity of the atrocities more personal.Yad Vashem&rsquo;s commitment to commemoration extends beyond the confines of mere ceremonial remembrance . For the second year now , its partnership with the Our 6 Million organization seeks to personalize remembrance by allowing individuals to pay homage to specific victims by lighting a memorial candle bearing the names of the murdered victims.Moreover , Yad Vashem , the World Holocaust Remembrance Center , has launched an innovative initiative aimed at engaging individuals from diverse backgrounds to raise public awareness about the Holocaust . The Who Is Your Holocaust Hero ? campaign invites international leaders , influencers , diplomats , and actors to personally connect with the Holocaust by sharing the story of an individual who serves as their Holocaust Hero . Participants are asked to record a short video clip , one to two minutes long , and share it on their social media platforms.As the world pauses to remember the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust , Yad Vashem reaffirms its commitment to preserving their memory and educating future generations about the importance of remembrance and tolerance.Through solemn ceremonies , innovative initiatives , and ongoing campaigns , Yad Vashem honors the legacy of those who perished , ensuring that their stories endure as a beacon of hope and resilience for generations to come . ■",holocaust remembrance day : observing with renewed urgency post-oct . 7

2021-10-25 20:55:02.297,jpost,"The Israeli military dropped leaflets accusing the Syrian Arab Army of cooperating with Hezbollah and explicitly named operatives working for the terrorist group on the Golan Heights , just hours after it carried out airstrikes in the area . The pamphlets were dropped shortly after Israel was accused by opposition sources of striking targets belonging to Hezbollah&rsquo;s so-called & ldquo;Golan File&rdquo ; near al-Ba&rsquo;ath and al-Krum in the southern Syrian province of Quneitra . Syria&rsquo;s SANA news agency later confirmed the strikes , saying : & ldquo;Zionist occupation forces committed a new aggression in the southern region at dawn today , as part of their repeated aggression against the sanctity and sovereignty of the Syrian territories . & rdquo ; The source quoted by SANA added , & ldquo;Syria affirms its right and ability to respond to these attacks and curb the aggressive tendency of the occupation authorities . & rdquo ; Syrian opposition sources said that among the targets of the attacks were the offices of Bashar Hussein , commander of the Reconnaissance and Observation Company in the 90th Brigade in the Syrian Arab Army . Hussein was one of the individuals named on the leaflets that warned SAA officers against working with Hezbollah . התקיפה המיוחסת לישראל בסוריה : גורמים באופוזיציה הסורית דיווחו כי צה""ל פיזר הבוקר עלונים בהם הזהיר מהמשך שיתוף הפעולה של צבא המדינה עם חיזבאללה . כמו כן אמרו כי היעדים שהותקפו הם בניין משרד האוצר , עמדת תצפית בתל כרום ומשרדו של מפקד פלוגת תצפיות , בשאר אל-חוסיין@kaisos1987 pic.twitter.com/dvN5YZGs6e & mdash ; כאן חדשות ( @ kann_news ) October 25 , 2021 The pamphlets also named Jawad Hashem , the son of Munir Shaito ( also known as Haj Hashem ) , who is the commander of the head of the group&rsquo;s operations on the Golan , and Hussein Hamoush , commander of the 90th Brigade . Pictures of the men , along with the cars that were driving , were found by local residents on Monday morning . The pamphlets had the eagle symbol of the 210th Bashan Division that defends the area bordering Syria . & ldquo;To the Syrian army elements . As we have mentioned in our previous warnings , your continued collaboration with Hezbollah and its stationing in South of Syria is what brings your suffering onto you , & rdquo ; the leaflets said . & ldquo;Nevertheless , some of you , such as the head of the reconnaissance unit in the 90th division Colonel Bashar Al Hussein , does not think twice before selling your and the civilians souls for helping Hajj Jawad Hashem , in service of continuing the reconnaissance projects of Hezbollah in the area of Tel Kurom Khan , the Financial building , and other areas , all the while disregarding the general interest and you own safety . Hezbollah is controlling you and using you secretly and publicly . Still , this does not prevent us from revealing its dirty deeds at all times and places . & rdquo ; Similar pamphlets were dropped in the area by the IDF in May , which warned Hamoush against working with the group . & ldquo;Stop cooperating with the Syrian and Lebanese personnel of Hezbollah , & rdquo ; the IDF warned at the time . & ldquo;Otherwise you will have no peace of mind . We note in particular Brig . - Gen . Hussein Hamoush , commander of Brigade 90 . And he is among those who have sold their consciences and their homeland at the cheapest of prices in return for aid for Hezbollah to camouflage their image among their masters , ignoring the general interest and your safety . & rdquo ; Israel has repeatedly warned that it would not tolerate Tehran&rsquo;s efforts to establish a permanent military presence in the Syrian Golan , and has admitted to hundreds of strikes against targets belonging to Iran and its proxy , Hezbollah . The strike comes a few days after Prime Minister Naftali Bennett met in Sochi , Russia , with President Vladimir Putin , who vowed that Moscow wouldn&rsquo;t hamper Jerusalem&rsquo;s freedom of action over Syria . Senior military officials have confirmed that there has been no friction between the two militaries , and that the deconfliction mechanism is working well . Two weeks ago Israel was accused of killing Madhat al-Salah by sniper fire in the town of Eltinah , near the village of Hadar on the Golan Heights along the border with Israel . Salah had previously spent time in an Israeli prison due to terrorist activities , and was considered a Syrian intelligence activist who was involved in recruiting sources in Israel . Though Israel has been accused by foreign media of targeting individuals working with Hezbollah in Syria in airstrikes , it was the first time that Israel was accused of using sniper fire against individuals involved with the terror group . Since Syrian troops recaptured southern Syria and returned to its positions , Hezbollah and Iranian-backed troops have deployed to the area . According to a report by the ALMA Research and Education Center , there are 58 locations belonging to the group in the southern Syrian provinces of Quneitra and Dara&rsquo;a . According to the report released last year , there are 28 locations with Hezbollah forces deployed as part of the Southern Command unit , and another 30 locations where there is a presence of cells operating under the Golan Project . The Southern Command , led by Munir Ali Na&rsquo;im Shaiti , is the Hezbollah unit in charge of southern Syria whose main function is to create a Hezbollah infrastructure in the area that not only gathers intelligence on the IDF , but trains the Syrian Arab Army 1st Corps for war with Israel . The Golan Project is under the command of Ali Mussa Daqduq , with headquarters in Damascus and Beirut . Close to 30 cells with dozens of operatives collecting intelligence on Israel and military movements are in the Syrian towns of Hadar , Quinetra and Erneh .

2023-07-12 22:11:21.473,jpost,"Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah warned that Hezbollah operatives had been given directives to respond to any attack on the tents the movement set up in Israeli territory over a month ago , during a speech on Wednesday marking the anniversary of the start of the 2006 Second Lebanon War . The comments were the first made by the Hezbollah leader concerning the tents since they were erected.The Second Lebanon War began on July 12 , 2006 , after Hezbollah launched diversionary rocket attacks on Israeli military positions and towns near the border , while simultaneously attacking a patrol of IDF humvees and kidnapping two soldiers . The war ended with UN Security Council Resolution 1701 after 41 Israeli civilians , 121 IDF soldiers , at least 500 Hezbollah operatives , and hundreds of Lebanese civilians were killed in the fighting.Last month , it was revealed to the public that Hezbollah had set up two tents in Israeli territory in the Shebaa Farms area , with armed operatives present in the tents . Israel has reportedly been conducting extensive diplomatic efforts through UNIFIL to convince Hezbollah to move the tents back into Lebanese territory , but Hezbollah and Lebanese officials have insisted that the area the tents are currently located in belongs to Lebanon.During his speech on Wednesday , Nasrallah stressed that Israel & ldquo;would not dare&rdquo ; to act against the tents , as Hezbollah would respond to any such action.توثيق لآليات عسكرية إسرائيلية من الكتيبة 90 في لواء "" كفير "" لقوة تدخل الجزء اللبناني من # قرية_الغجر لأول مرة منذ شهر أيلول 2022تاريخ إعلان الانسحاب العسكري الصهيوني من الجزء اللبناني وتحويلها إلى منطقة سياحية . pic.twitter.com/CAf2ywucDc&mdash ; علي شعيب | | Ali Shoeib 🇱 🇧 ( @ alishoeib1970 ) July 12 , 2023Nasrallah reiterated the claim that the tents are located in Lebanese territory , not Israeli territory , adding that the tents were only put up after Israeli authorities began building a fence around the village of Ghajar , which is split in half by the Blue Line with half in Lebanon and half in Israel . "" Starting from last year , the enemy raised a fence to annex the northern part of the town of Ghajar , which is Lebanese territory with international recognition , and what happened recently is that it finished building the barrier and turned it into a tourist area amid silence from the United Nations . "" IDF confirms it thwarted an attempt to damage the border fence , saying it used measures to distance the suspects and that the identity of the suspects is unknown . pic.twitter.com/A4ALnsxXtI&mdash ; Tzvi Joffre ( @ TzviJoffre ) July 12 , 2023The Hezbollah leader additionally referenced scuffles that took place between Lebanese citizens and Israeli forces along the Lebanese border on Wednesday , stating that the incidents were "" under investigation "" and stressing that "" necessary measures "" would be carried out once the investigation was completed.Lebanese media reports indicated that three members of Hezbollah were injured after approaching the border fence , with the IDF stating that it had acted against suspects who had attempted to damage the fence , with video from the scene showing suspects nearing the fence before a non-lethal explosive detonated on the fence and they ran away.الإسرائيلي قال عمل إنجاز و أحبط محاولة لتخريب السياج بإطلاق نار تحذيري على فتيان أطلقوا مفرقعات على الحدودقاموا طلعوا على الجدار وقبعوا كاميرات التجسس 😄 pic.twitter.com/8R0CHUWHJh&mdash ; علي شعيب | | Ali Shoeib 🇱 🇧 ( @ alishoeib1970 ) July 12 , 2023Referring to Ghajar , Nasrallah warned that Hezbollah "" could not remain silent "" on the matter and accused Israel of "" occupying "" the village . "" The land of Ghajar , the Sheeba Farms , and the Kfarchouba hills will not be left to the Israelis , "" stressed Nasrallah . "" Work must be done to liberate it , and the effort will be shared between the state and the resistance . "" Referring to reports that Hezbollah and Lebanese officials were pushing for talks on demarcating the land border between Israel and Lebanon , Nasrallah stressed that "" What is happening now is not the demarcation of land borders with the enemy entity , but rather we demand the withdrawal of the enemy from the occupied Lebanese points . "" Nasrallah added that the borders between Israel and Lebanon have been set since the 1920s , seemingly referencing the Paulet&ndash;Newcombe Agreement of 1923 - which was signed between Britain and France to mark the border between Mandatory Palestine and Syria and Lebanon . & ldquo;The Israeli&rsquo;s deterrence has eroded , but he is shameless . He makes contacts in which he talks about the breach of Lebanon while he is carrying out thousands of breaches . I call for counting the Israeli breaches by land , sea , and air , and what the enemy claims are Lebanese breaches . & rdquo;Nasrallah additionally ridiculed Israeli media , saying media outlets "" exaggerate matters "" and are "" a large part of the terror that affects the residents of "" northern Israel . The Hezbollah leader pointed to a recent incident in which rumors of an explosion spread on social media after Lebanese residents who live near the border launched fireworks during a wedding.Tensions remain high along the Lebanese borderLast week , an anti-tank missile was fired toward the village of Ghajar , which is split in half by the Blue Line . In response to the missile fire , the IDF launched artillery strikes on sites near the towns of Kfarchouba and Halta . Over 15 shells were fired by the IDF toward southern Lebanon , according to Lebanon's National News Agency.The missile fire came shortly after a statement by Hezbollah expressing outrage at the construction of a fence around Ghajar , with the movement accusing Israel of implementing a "" complete occupation "" of the village and stressing that "" this is not just a routine breach of what the occupation forces are accustomed to from time to time . "" On Wednesday morning , Hezbollah-affiliated media published footage of Israeli forces operating in the northern part of Ghajar , calling the presence of Israeli forces a & ldquo;breach . & rdquo;Additionally , in recent weeks , the IDF and Lebanese citizens have clashed at various points along the Lebanese border while the IDF carried out maintenance work near the technical fence , including in the Shebaa Farms area.On Tuesday night , during a meeting with Hezbollah&rsquo;s Shura Council , Nasrallah reportedly claimed that UNIFIL had informed the movement that Israel had on one morning threatened to remove the tents set up by Hezbollah , but then proceeded to continuously push the threat off indefinitely.Lebanese officials reject demands to move Hezbollah tentsEarlier this week , a number of Lebanese officials issued statements rejecting demands to move the tents set up by Hezbollah and demanding that Israel start talks to demarcate the land border between the two countries.After a meeting between UNIFIL Commander Aroldo L&aacute;zaro , Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati , and Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib on Monday , Bou Habib stated that "" the security situation in the south was discussed , and they conveyed to us the demand of the Israeli side to remove the ' tent . ' Our response was that we want them to retreat from northern Ghajar , which is considered Lebanese territory . From our side , we recorded about 18 Israeli border violations . "" In a later meeting with UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon Joanna Wronecka and US Ambassador to Beirut Dorothy Shea , Bou Habib stressed the need to demarcate the land borders between Lebanon and Israel in tripartite meetings , according to Lebanon's National News Agency.Bou Habib additionally informed the two that Lebanon intended to file a complaint with the UN Security Council concerning Israel's presence in the northern part of Ghajar.Additionally on Monday , Lebanon's speaker of parliament , Nabih Berri , stated that the tent set up by Hezbollah is on Lebanese territory , adding that "" what is required of the international community is to oblige Israel to implement Resolution 1701 and to withdraw from the northern part of the village of Ghajar , the Shebaa Farms , the Kfarchouba hills , and point B1 [ north of Rosh Hanikra ] . "" Free Patriotic Movement leader Gebran Bassil , a political ally of Hezbollah , expressed outrage at reports that Lebanese officials aimed to discuss the demarcation of a border with Israel , stating on Wednesday that this "" constitutes a flagrant constitutional violation "" and that only the president of the country is authorized to conduct such negotiations.Bassil added that the border of the country is already demarcated and defined on the basis of the Paulet&ndash;Newcombe Agreement and UN Security Council Resolution 425 which called on Israel to withdraw from Lebanese territory to "" internationally recognized boundaries . "" "" [ There can be ] no concession of a grain of soil from the land of Lebanon , and any talk of negotiation on the land borders is a violation of the constitution and a suspicious act , and those who carry it out are subject to accountability , "" said Bassil , adding that the Hezbollah tents , Ghajar , and Hochstein's visit are unrelated to land border demarcations.US envoy Amos Hochstein met with Israeli officials on Tuesday , reportedly to discuss the tensions on the northern border . The Lebanese al-Akhbar newspaper reported that Lebanese officials were informed that Israel is interested in entering talks concerning demarcating the land border between the two countries and that Hochstein may visit Beirut soon .",nasrallah warns hezbollah will respond if tents are attacked
2023-10-18 20:58:15.947,jpost,"On US President Joe Biden&rsquo;s flight to Tel Aviv on Wednesday , National Security spokesperson John Kirby said Biden would be asking Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu & ldquo;some tough questions . & rdquo;Among those tough questions were certainly ones about what Israel would do to prevent as many civilian casualties as possible inside Gaza , what Israel would do to prevent a humanitarian crisis , and how Jerusalem planned to respond to Hezbollah provocations in the north.And one of those tough questions was surely a simple one : what is the endgame ? What is Israel&rsquo;s plan and vision for the Gaza Strip the day after?Israel clearly stated the goal of this war : to destroy Hamas and remove its control over Gaza . But what happens the day after ? Then what?Amid the horror , shock , and fury that has gripped this country since October 7 , there has been little public discussion inside Israel of this issue and the future of the Gaza Strip.From an Israeli point of view , this is entirely understandable . With the blood still boiling from the horrific Simchat Torah massacre , the country&rsquo;s focus is simply on uprooting Hamas , on delivering the terrorist organization a mortal blow . & nbsp;Everything else can wait , including apportioning blame and responsibility for the catastrophe and thinking about what comes next.But for Washington , a & ldquo;we-will-deal-with-this-later&rdquo ; attitude is not enough , and for Biden to be able to sell continued support for Israel to his party and his country , he obviously wants to know what policy he is supporting and what Israel wants to do after Hamas is expelled.Hamas : Short-term vs long-term goalsDelivering a devastating blow to Hamas and removing them from power in Gaza are short-term goals . But what is the long-term goal ? This is important to define because some will only support short-term goals if they know the long-term plan.And this places Israel in a dilemma because it has never articulated any long-term plan for Gaza.Before October 7 , Israel&rsquo;s policy toward Gaza could be summed up as containing terrorism until Hamas either realizes that it is not in their interest to pursue terror or something big happens and it is driven from power.Well , now something big has happened , and Israel is determined to drive Hamas from power . Biden came here partly to hear from Israel what comes next.On the face of it , the options are rather limited.The first option is that Israel re-occupies Gaza - - either the whole area or part of it - - and remains there indefinitely.The logic behind this is that the only way to ensure that , once kicked out , Hamas does not return is for Israel to be in control.While two weeks ago this idea would have been dismissed as the rantings of the far-right , the Simchat Torah atrocities have brought discussion of that into the mainstream . Even though President Isaac Herzog has said publicly that Israel has no intention of doing this , the idea is out there.In a 60-minute interview on Sunday , Biden related to this and said that , in his estimation , such a move would be a & ldquo;big mistake . & rdquo ; He certainly made that position clear in his meetings here on Wednesday.After dismantling Hamas , a second option is for Israel to hand control of it and its more than two million residents to the Palestinian Authority.The problem with this option is that the Palestinian Authority , both weak and highly unpopular among Palestinians , can barely control the areas in the West Bank currently under its control , let alone take on a much bigger project . & nbsp;In this scenario , handing Gaza over to the PA , which the Palestinian Authority lost control of in 2007 in a bloody coup , would likely necessitate Israel retaining the right to enter the Gaza Strip , as it does currently in Palestinian towns in the West Bank , for security reasons.A third option would be for Egypt to take control of the area , something Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has made abundantly clear he has no interest in doing.And another option would be for Gaza to come under the administration of some kind of international consortium , perhaps an international peacekeeping team or a group of states from the Organization of Islamic Conference.This option , too , is considered unrealistic . First , few countries are biting at the bit to take on this chore . Second , Israel&rsquo;s experience with international peacekeepers keeping terrorist groups out of territory has not been good , as evidenced by the situation in southern Lebanon , where peacekeepers have been unable to keep Hezbollah from taking control and threatening Israel.In addition , inviting international actors into an area where Israel might continuously need to engage militarily is only inviting trouble.Since none of those possibilities are particularly attractive , developing other , perhaps more creative ideas is needed to present as an endgame.Having an endgame is essential not only to answer Biden&rsquo;s question but also for other reasons , including to help Israel&rsquo;s public diplomacy efforts as the war grinds on and the focus , as is already the case , moves from the October 7 massacre to the devastation in Gaza.Israeli spokespeople interviewed about the situation have so far been able to deflect questions about an endgame by saying & ldquo;first things first , & rdquo ; first let the country defeat Hamas , and then Israel will deal with the future of Gaza . & nbsp;But the country&rsquo;s public diplomacy efforts would be helped if the spokespeople said , & ldquo;We are destroying Hamas today , and this is what we want to see happen tomorrow . & rdquo;In the need for an endgame , Israel should learn from the experience of the 1967 Six-Day War . Israel won that war , but never succeeded in clearly defining what it hoped to see down the line . It never defined clearly , and still has not defined clearly , what its endgame was for Judea and Samaria . And it suffered from that lack of clarity.As the Palestinians demanded a complete return to the 1967 lines , Israel always said what it wanted depended on what the Arabs said , what the Americans wanted , and what the Palestinians would agree to . But Israel never stated clearly what it wanted to do with the territories . It always depends , but depends is not policy . One cannot achieve what one does not define.Israel already needs to define what it wants to see happen in Gaza when the war ends and Hamas is destroyed . Only then , maybe , will this be achievable .",israel already needs a plan for the day after it topples hamas - analysis

2023-02-18 15:42:53.083,jpost,"Tensions are elevated in Jerusalem amid several devastating terrorist attacks in the city over the past month . & nbsp;The first , on a Shabbat evening in the Neveh Ya&rsquo;acov neighborhood , left seven Israelis dead as they departed synagogue to go home to their meals . The next day , a 13-year-old Palestinian opened fire on Jewish worshipers in the City of David , leaving two civilians wounded . Shortly before sundown on Friday last week , a terrorist rammed his vehicle into Israelis at a bus stop , killing three & ndash ; including two brothers aged six and eight . And there were two stabbing attacks this past week , one by a 14-year-old.This is alongside record numbers of Palestinians being killed by IDF forces in the West Bank during ensuing raids and arrests , leading to a general feeling of unease by everyone in the holy city . The Magazine spoke with a range of individuals in the capital to find out how they feel , what they are doing differently , and where they see things going.What did Israelis think about the violence in Jerusalem?Views were diverse , depending on where they stood in the spectrum & ndash ; whether native-born Israeli , immigrant , secular or religious . For example , Samantha Levy , an activist who moved to Israel nine years ago , said that & ldquo;the circumstances in Jerusalem lead me to seek out training in self-defense and how to handle security threats . & rdquo;For native Israelis or those who have lived in the country for a long time , recent events have rekindled horrid memories from the days of the Second Intifada in the early 2000s . Noam Elia , an Israeli-American who grew up in Jerusalem and returned six months ago after living in New York for a decade , said that the situation is not like then , when buses were blowing up nearly every week . He added , however , that things are moving in a dangerous direction . & nbsp ; & ldquo;I remember during the Second Intifada riding my scooter up Agrippas Street and was about to turn into the Nahalot neighborhood when I saw a police officer at the end of the street . I decided not to turn , and a few seconds later a huge explosion went off . It is scary . & rdquo;Noam Elia&ldquo;I remember during the Second Intifada riding my scooter up Agrippas Street and was about to turn into the Nahalot neighborhood when I saw a police officer at the end of the street . I decided not to turn , and a few seconds later a huge explosion went off . It is scary . & rdquo ; Although bombs are not going off today , & ldquo;you have to keep an eye out for suspicious people or activities . Jerusalem is the center of all of this . & rdquo;Emanuel , a tech entrepreneur , recalled what it was like to grow up in Jerusalem . & ldquo;You are exposed to persistent conflict from a young age . I remember being in school in the heart of the city , and you could hear the sounds of attacks while sitting in class . & ldquo;The constant state of alertness , whether at bus stops or while taking public transportation , has become a way of life for me . Despite this , I have not let it sway my choice of making Jerusalem my home . & rdquo;Another resident , Isabella Swart , said there is a sense of anxiety in the air but that & ldquo;Israel is a super-resilient country . We are not afraid because we are in our land with our people . & rdquo ; She continued with a suggestion to add cement barriers on sidewalks to prevent ramming . & nbsp;Elya Cowland of Ramot , where the two children were killed last week , spoke somberly about an attack that was close to home . & ldquo;Despite not knowing the victims , I feel a heightened sense of tragedy and loss . When terror struck my neighborhood , the numbness I usually feel regarding these attacks shattered . I saw with complete clarity the heinousness and horrific nature of the event . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;Despite not knowing the victims , I feel a heightened sense of tragedy and loss . When terror struck my neighborhood , the numbness I usually feel regarding these attacks shattered . I saw with complete clarity the heinousness and horrific nature of the event . & rdquo;Elya CowlandRabbi Yehoshua Pfeffer of Ramot also spoke about the attacks as he was headed to the shiva for the victims , pointing out two ways to view the situation . & ldquo;On the one hand , this is a human tragedy & ndash ; and that is perhaps the first reaction , especially with this so close to home . These are bus stops where all our kids are , so you feel a certain sense of insecurity ; you don&rsquo;t know who is going to be next . The result is a more tense atmosphere . & ldquo;The religious response is to turn to God in prayer and strengthen elements of practice . But there is also the political aspect . For example , people such as [ National Security Minister Itamar ] Ben-Gvir have promised to restore security in face of attacks and threats . & ldquo;He is always first at the scene and garnered support from even haredim and the youth . And yet , has he done anything ? Is it all talk or will he actually do something that will give us a greater sense of security ? & rdquo;He pointed out that Ramot is a primarily haredi area . & ldquo;We don&rsquo;t consider ourselves settlers ; there is no settler consciousness here . This is happening to us , and what is the response from our rabbis and [ haredi ] politicians ? Nothing . Just to pray . Of course we need to , but we also need policy . & rdquo;Pfeffer lamented the imbalance between MKs and rabbis , who & ldquo;can speak up on religious matters & ndash ; which are important & ndash ; but so are people&rsquo;s lives . If you have the privilege to be in power , you cannot sit on the sidelines . It is up to [ the politicians ] to come up with some type of policy . & rdquo;ARABS WHO live in east Jerusalem chose to remain anonymous when speaking with the Magazine . One said that he thinks that & ldquo;the silent majority of east Jerusalemites don&rsquo;t like attacks on civilians because it hurts them more than it benefits them . However , I think the majority see attacks on soldiers and police as a win . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Others expressed outrage at the deadly shooting at the Neveh Ya&rsquo;acov synagogue , saying that & ldquo;attacks on those leaving prayer services is crossing a line . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Yet it is evident that the general mood among Palestinians in east Jerusalem and the West Bank is reaching a boiling point . This is especially true in east Jerusalem . Arabs there are under complete Israeli sovereignty , yet lack the same services that are available to Israelis . This includes issues surrounding passports and visas & ndash ; flash points , as they desire the freedom to travel and work abroad . The reality is bleaker in West Bank cities such as Nablus or Jenin , where many attackers come from.What happens going forward?Policymakers are assessing how the terror attacks will impact tourism and , in turn , the economy . Upward of four million people on average visit Jerusalem annually , with tourism a vital economic lifeline . Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Fleur Hassan-Nahoum , whose portfolio includes tourism , told the Magazine that & ldquo;the recent terrorist attacks have shaken our whole nation and left us in mourning . I understand the fear and concern among our residents and tourists alike , but Jerusalem is a city of strength and resilience . & ldquo;It has faced and overcome many challenges in the past , and these acts of terror will not define it . & rdquo ; She continued that & ldquo;necessary measures have been taken to ensure safety and security . I am confident that Jerusalem will continue to thrive and attract visitors from around the world . & rdquo;HOW TO respond on an individual level is a question on the minds of many . Ben-Gvir has pushed for expediting gun licenses for civilians , pointing to the fact that many terrorists are stopped quickly by armed Israelis . Those interviewed echoed this sentiment , expressing a desire to obtain a license and purchase a gun . Some are even carrying deterrents such as pepper spray or knives.Elia said he has purchased pepper spray for himself and his family ; others said they keep an eye out for potentially dangerous situations . & nbsp;Arguably , the most frightening reality about the current attacks is just how unpredictable they can be . Unlike in the past , when attacks were often carried out by centralized terror groups , today&rsquo;s terrorists may have no prior history of criminal behavior , yet find themselves so radicalized that they take up arms . & nbsp;These types of & ldquo;lone wolf&rdquo ; terrorists have sprung up across the world and are also a challenge for Israel&rsquo;s police forces . Though there is a common profile of these attackers & ndash ; single and unemployed & ndash ; the provocative rhetoric in the mosques and the proliferation of hateful messaging on social media are also inciting brutal attacks on civilians , young and old.WHERE THIS is leading to is anyone&rsquo;s guess . Will it spiral into an all-out third intifada as some predict ? Though many hope not , the possibility is nevertheless being discussed . Even the smallest of perceived provocations , such as Ariel Sharon&rsquo;s 2000 visit to the Temple Mount , can spiral out of control and be the catalyst of wide-scale disturbances.Levy pointed out that the lack of action or change in the political realm ensures that the status quo of terror will continue . & ldquo;Our political figures have not been pursuing the change that we need . & rdquo ; As a result , & ldquo;it makes no sense that children should have to be killed by a ramming at a bus stop before Shabbat or that older people should be killed as they exit a synagogue after prayers . & rdquo;Elia believes politicians like Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich are aiming for escalation , as & ldquo;it can help reach a determination in the conflict . & rdquo;In any case , it is clear from these discussions that despite the uptick in violence , no one is making plans to leave the country . This is their home , nowhere else . With that in mind , no amount of attacks can stop people from continuing to move to the capital and start families . ",what do jerusalemites think about security on the streets ?

The ceremony opened with a moment of silence for the victims of October 7 and a call to return the hostages in Gaza , when a banner of their photos was placed on the stage throughout the event.The first to take the stage was the singer Ilanit , the first singer to represent Israel in the competition 50 years ago , in 1973.She was followed by Mei Finegold , who represented Israel a decade ago in 2014 . When she was asked what she thought of those who were against Israel in the competition , she answered - "" Those who hate will hate and die . Those who love will differ and have a long life .

2021-01-18 01:57:54.950,jpost,"The European Union hinted that Israeli settlement activity could harm the Abraham Accords as Prime Minister [ Benjamin ] Netanyahu spoke of a possible declaration to legalize 46 outposts & quot;within days&quot ; and the IDF advanced plans for 792 settler homes . @ @ @ At this critical juncture for peace in the Middle East , these moves are & hellip ; counterproductive in light of the positive developments of normalization agreements between Israel and a number of Arab States , & quot ; said the spokesperson for EU foreign affairs and security policy . Under the rubric of the Trump administration @ @ @ s Abraham Accords , Israel normalized ties with the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Morocco and Sudan in exchange for the suspension of plans to annex the settlements . No mention was made of settlement activity , which has been a source of conflict with the EU and is likely to be problem between Israel and US President-elect Joe Biden who takes office on Wednesday . & quot;The EU has repeatedly called on Israel to end all settlement activity , and to dismantle outposts erected since March 2001 , & quot ; the EU spokesperson said . He reiterated that settlement activity was & quot;contrary to international law and further undermines the prospects of a viable two-state solution . & quot ; He also called on Israel to suspend an east Jerusalem project for new Jewish homes in Givat Hamatos . The spokesperson for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Israel @ @ @ s recent settlement moves were a slight to Biden . This is a preemptive attempt to undermine any effort by the Biden @ @ @ s administration to relaunch the stalled peace process , spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh said . His words were reported in the Palestinian news agency WAFA . Rudeineh called for immediate international action . Rudeineh spoke after the Higher Planning Council for Judea and Samaria met Sunday . It agreed to the deposit of plans for 415 new homes and to the authorization of 377 units . The left-wing NGO Peace Now said that & ldquo;by promoting hundreds of settlement units , Prime Minister [ Benjamin ] Netanyahu is once again putting his personal political interests over those of the country . Not only will this settlement activity erode the possibility for a conflict-ending resolution with the Palestinians in the long-term , but in the short-term it needlessly sets Israel on a collision course with the incoming Biden administration . & rdquo ; The advancement of two of the plans , moved two outposts forward in the path towards legalization . This included deposit of a plan for 96 homes in the Havat Yair outpost , which will become a new neighborhood of the Yakir settlements . In addition , a plan for 94 homes in the Nofei Nechemia outpost was deposited so that the community could become a new neighborhood of the Rehelim settlement . & nbsp ; An additional 118 homes for that community were also advanced . Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan called the deposit of plans for the two outposts an & quot;historic achievement&quot ; and said that it marked the turning point towards their authorization . The advancement of plans for these two outposts is independent of the overall outpost battle that the Yesha Council is waging . It has called for the government to declare its intent to legalize the outposts . Plans for 107 news homes in the Tel Menashe settlement were also deposited . Tel Menashe is the home community of terror victim Esther Horgan , who was killed while jogging in a nearby forest . Her family had called for additional building in her memory . Her husband Benjamin participated in the Council meeting over Zoom and thanked its members . The Higher Planning Council also gave its approval to plans for 377 settler homes . This included 66 in Oranit , 36 in Karnei Shomron , 152 in Shavei Shomron and 123 in Itamar . Settler reaction was muted in part because focus has been on the large outpost battle and because the number of settler homes advanced is low compared to past meetings , when the number of units advanced were often in the range of several thousand .",eu hints israeli settlement activity harms abraham accords
2023-10-14 08:14:04.327,jpost,"Like most people in Israel , Ran was awakened by sirens on Saturday.He lives in Tel Aviv . His full name cannot be used for security reasons . He is a soldier in Israel&rsquo;s elite Lotar counterterrorism unit.Ran went to the shelter with his family , and then went back to sleep . Then there was another siren , and he turned on the TV to see the horrific images the rest of the country was waking up to.In another part of Israel , Tal Boorstein , a reservist and regiment commander in the 969th battalion , which is part of the 7643 brigade in the Gaza division , was also called up on Shabbat . He left synagogue and said goodbye to his family in order to head to his unit , which is usually deployed in northern Gaza . & ldquo;We took our uniforms and equipment and went to the call-up , & rdquo ; said Boorstein . This would be his third operation in Gaza . Many reservists who had been out of the unit for years wanted to join and help.Meanwhile , Roe Bergman , a company commander in Kfir , was also awakened at home . His unit was deployed near Nablus in the West Bank . He , too , donned his fatigues , got his equipment and weapon , and began preparing for war . & ldquo;I took my equipment and my rifle , and we headed south , & rdquo ; he recounted . & ldquo;During the drive , we began to understand how large the attack was , and we arrived near Kibbutz Re&rsquo;im , driving from Netivot and then through the fields . & rdquo;Soon afterwards , the soldiers heard the sound of fighting . They arrived at the kibbutz , where they met the unit&rsquo;s commanding officer . The extent of the attack and horror of the day began to sink in.Twenty-five kilometers north of Re&rsquo;im is another community , Or HaNer , near Sderot . Barak Cohen , a member of the kibbutz&rsquo;s security team , was also woken up by sirens . The community is two kilometers from the border . He heard from his security team , the Kita Konenut , that they needed to go help their colleagues in Erez , a kibbutz even closer to Gaza , just across the road.The men got their weapons and ammunition and rushed to Erez . The security detail living there were facing a difficult situation , with terrorists infiltrating from the border and shooting from bushes and tree lines . The civilians were all sheltering at home . It was feared that the terrorists had already broken into the kibbutz . & ldquo;Immediately , I and another member of the Konenut went to Erez ; we found the leader of Konenut , and he took us to the location . We saw one person dead , from Konenut , at the entrance to a house , and there was a lot of shooting at us and bullets over our heads . We tried to respond with fire . & rdquo;It was still early in the morning , but as the fighters began to arrive at various locations , they became aware of the extent of the attack . The IDF was still mobilizing . Many units on the border had been overrun.Retaking Gaza border towns after Hamas massacred hundreds of civiliansNo one had any idea that already hundreds of civilians were being massacred.THE COUNTERTERRORISM Lotar mission deals with complex hostage situations . In general , upon arrival it assesses the situation and uses precision tactics and special tactics to neutralize terrorists . & ldquo;I have to be certain about every shot that I take and be responsible for every bullet that comes out of my rifle , & rdquo ; said Ran.The team is supposed to be an QRF ( quick reaction force ) , along with other elite units such as Shaldag , Duvdevan , and Seyeret Metkal . On Saturday , it had to deal with a massive terrorist wave swamping the entire border and threatening 20 communities and some 60,000 people.The QRF always has a unit on standby that can proceed to a scene . By 7:30 a.m . , the first unit had arrived in Sderot . This was a four-man team , and it was confronting a situation where , according to some estimates , 250 terrorists had tried to infiltrate the city . & ldquo;As the first team went to Sderot , my team member and I went to the unit and began mobilizing the team [ to operate ] alongside the Gaza Strip , from south to north , to see how we could create some safety net around the Strip in order to push and make it more organized when the entire military arrives and joins the fight , & rdquo ; Boorstein explained.As he proceeded to join his unit , he said , all the reservists had received the gear that they needed . This was in contrast to some reports of reservists showing up and saying they lacked some important items . & ldquo;Every soldier who came got a weapon and helmets and everything needed , including water , food , and ammunition . We have it all . & rdquo;Meanwhile , Bergman&rsquo;s Kfir unit had retaken Re&rsquo;im . & nbsp;There had been some 40 terrorists there , and they were neutralized . The unit killed 10 of them . Then they began to assist in the rescue of people . In one home , people were hiding in a shelter , and terrorists were in the house.The unit came to the door and managed to throw grenades , killing the terrorists and rescue those hiding.TWO TERRORIST bodies were found . It took two days to secure the entire area.Then the unit went to Kibbutz Be&rsquo;eri , where there had been a massacre and more than 100 bodies were found . This was a difficult battle.Now Bergman has been sent to the North , and another unit had replaced theirs.For Ran and the QRF , the battle had just begun . & nbsp;The Lotar went street by street in Sderot , clearing the city of terrorists . They killed at least 15 among the enemy . They said terrorists were operating in many places , and the initial chaos meant that the enemy seemed to be everywhere . One member of the Lotar was killed in Sderot ; another was wounded . The team of 12 , bolstered by other members who had just arrived , was then led by the sergeant , who took over for the wounded commander . & ldquo;By 8:30 to 9 a.m . , a lot of special forces units were joining us to create this safety net in Sderot , and they continued the fighting , & rdquo ; Ran recounted.The unit was also involved in retaking and securing the military base near Nahal Oz , where , Ran estimated , there were 150 IDF casualties . Some were killed and burned alive , he said . & ldquo;You can imagine what they did to the bodies , and the amount of things I&rsquo;ve seen , it&rsquo;s not even close to what a human being is . I can&rsquo;t imagine what drives them to do such things . . . We saved as many soldiers as we could ; some were trapped and hiding alongside the outpost . & rdquo ; After securing the area , they moved along the security fence to an IDF outpost called Taga.There , they found a scene from a horror movie . It was quiet , silent even . Yet the war was raging along the border . The Golani brigade was supposed to be in Taga.The counterterrorism forces had 28 members by this time , including some from Oketz , the unit that operates with specially trained dogs . Ran praised one of the dogs for saving lives in the battle.As they moved through the outpost , which seemed abandoned , suddenly they saw two shapes in the distance . It could be a hostage situation , they feared . But it turned out to be two terrorists , and the Israeli fighters shot them . It took about 30 minutes to clear the area , and they saved five Golani soldiers who were sheltering . & ldquo;We scanned another site nearby that belongs to another Israeli security service of Israel . & rdquo;When the area was secure , they moved on to another mission and drove to Nir Yitzhak , a kibbutz . & ldquo;It was Saturday night . We were guarding around the kibbutz and making sure no terrorists were infiltrating the kibbutz lines . By now , reserve teams were mobilized to Be&rsquo;eri . There was a whole massacre there of 100 to 200 civilians ; none of them were armed , & rdquo ; he said.He then joined IDF units from Shayetet , Shaldag , Yamam and others to retake the area . It took 18 hours of fighting . Then they helped evacuate people from Kissufim , Nir Yitzhak , Sufa , Kerem Shalom , and other places.ON OCTOBER 7 , the QRF faced an unbelievable challenge never seen before in Israel . With 20 locations under attack and approximately six units trained for these kinds of situations , they had to prioritize where to go first . For instance , Shaldag and Seyeret Matkal went to Sderot . Others went to Be&rsquo;eri and Ofakim.Many areas were left for the locals to defend , as they had to wait for the army to arrive . That was the case in Erez . Cohen and his small team from the two communities were able to save the kibbutz from slaughter by laying down fire and keeping the enemy away from the community&rsquo;s entrance . However , they felt surrounded for many hours and knew there were enemy snipers nearby . & ldquo;From 7 to 11 a.m . , no one came to support us , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know what was happening . We wondered & lsquo;Where is the army ? & rsquo ; Then we understood that there was a large attack . & rdquo;They felt alone . The enemy brought up an RPG ( rocket-propelled grenade ) and fired at them . It hit a house , but luckily the family inside survived . They heard the sound of tanks in the distance but didn&rsquo;t know what was happening . At Or HaNer , there was concern that terrorists could strike . Cohen faced the difficult choice of whether to send two members of the team back to his community or to keep them in Erez . They stayed in Erez . There was a buzzing , perhaps a helicopter in the distance . But the din of shooting meant it was hard to know.Eventually , the army arrived at 11 a.m . and rescued the security team . An entire community was saved.Others had been massacred.Cohen was then called up to his unit and began serving near his community . & ldquo;The casualties we had was the member of the Konenut who died , and two wounded that we managed to rescue from the terrorists , & rdquo ; he said . & ldquo;We had a very complex situation . & rdquo;He emphasized it is important to understand that in the most recent days of the war , his battalion experienced success . & ldquo;We are approaching victory . We are a strong nation with a strong army . & rdquo;BOORSTEIN&rdquo;S UNIT defended communities around Gaza during the fighting on Saturday and in the days after . He has a long record of experience in these types of battles , having served in the 2006 Lebanon War and in this year&rsquo;s Operation Break the Wave and Operation Shield and Arrow . Despite the initial setbacks on Saturday and the massacre of civilians , he stressed that Israel will win this war . & ldquo;We will rebuild & ndash ; here and everywhere in Israel , & rdquo ; he said , adding that all of Israel saw the hellish story that unfolded on Shabbat . Everyone watched the news and saw & ldquo;very difficult images . & rdquo ; & ldquo;But despite how hard it is , we will win and change and become a stronger society as Israel knows how to do . & rdquo ; ",how the idf retook the gaza border from hamas terrorists

2023-11-23 08:56:38.440,jpost,"The IDF and the Shin Bet ( Israel Security Agency ) around 2:30 p.m . Thursday afternoon finally admitted to having arrested the director of Shifa Hospital , which has been at the center of media narrative battles between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.First , reports in the Palestinian and Hebrew media about his arrest surfaced already much earlier Thursday morning.Questioned repeatedly earlier in the morning about why he had been arrested and why no official announcement had gone out , Israeli and IDF officials ' responses alternated from surprise at the event to a promise that an announcement would go out soon.However , even the 2:30 p.m . announcement did not make any direct charges against the Shifa chief.Rather , the announcement said that he had been arrested and brought to the Shin Bet for interrogation after significant testimony and video evidence from others that Shifa had been used as a command center for Hamas during the director's tenure.The statement stated , "" the terror group Hamas utilized many resources , including electricity in order to strengthen its tunnels which it built under the hospital . In addition , Hamas kept military items stored in the hospital and in its immediate surroundings . "" In addition , the statement read that after the October 7 Hamas mass terror attack on Israel's South , the terror group "" used the hospital as a refuge for its terror forces and even brought Israeli hostages to there who were kidnapped during the day of slaughter . A pathology report confirmed that soldier Noa Marciano was murdered on the grounds of Shifa Hospital . "" Next , the statement said vaguely that , "" a decision regarding his detention would be made in conjunction with the findings of the investigation regarding his involvement with the hospital's connection to terror . "" There are a number of possible scenarios about how this could play out.If Israel has direct Palestinian witness testimony or videographic evidence to incriminate the director , he could actually be brought to trial before special civilian courts or Israeli military courts on those charges and could be potentially sentenced to prison time in Israel.Alternatively , Israel may not have such direct incriminating evidence , and its evidence may be more ambiguous , such as the idea that it would be impossible for any reasonable director to be completely oblivious to the sheer volume of uses by Hamas of his hospital.In this case , it might still try to mount a case for some kind of easier to prove more minor charge , such as aiding and abetting terrorism without even being a member of a terror group.Yet another possibility is that the Shin Bet hopes to scare him into providing them intelligence information to more quickly uncover the remaining aspects of Hamas's concealed presence at Shifa , in which case if he cooperates , he may be released with no charges.Even if a case is brought against him , he could always defend against any conviction by claiming his life was under threat and that any passive cooperation he provided to Hamas was under coercion and duress , or was for the benefit of his patients , who Hamas might otherwise kill.This could make him difficult to convict.In all scenarios , detaining him will be complex globally , as generally democracies do not detain senior medical staff who are not their citizens.Hamas immediately condemned the arrest of the director of the hospital , saying "" We see this move by Israel as nothing less than despicable , lacking any sense of humanity and morals . It is also a flagrant violation of international norms and charters , given obligations to ensure that medical personnel are never harmed , including in times of war . "" "" We call on international bodies , including the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , with which Dr . Muhammad was in contact to evacuate the remaining patients and wounded from Al-Shifa Hospital , to exert pressure on the Israeli occupation army to secure his release , along with the medical personnel who were arrested simply for continuing to fulfill their humanitarian duty . "" Since 2014 , top Israeli defense officials have repeatedly stated that top Hamas officials spent the 2014 Gaza conflict hiding in tunnels under Shifa Hospital and the complex has since been turned into a massive underground military installation.In recent days , the IDF has published footage showing rooms and tunnels found under the hospital , as well as weapons found in the facility.Hostages held in Shifa hospitalSurveillance camera footage retrieved from the hospital showed at least two hostages being brought by armed individuals into the hospital on October 7 , including one who was being dragged by his head through the hospital.IDF R . - Adm . Daniel Hagari also revealed recently that intelligence has shown that Israeli hostage , Noa Marciano , was killed in Shifa.The IDF did not comment on reports that a small number of other medical staff were arrested.Meanwhile , the IDF worked hard on Thursday to toughen its positions across northern Gaza to prevent any surprise attacks by Hamas.In 2014 , Hamas violated a number of temporary ceasefires , in some cases successfully surprising and killing IDF soldiers.IDF Chief-of-Staff Lt . - Gen . Herzi Halevi had held a briefing with all major generals , brigadier generals , and colonels involved in Gaza operations on Wednesday to ensure that they would be ready for anything Hamas might try.The IDF also said that Maj . Gen . ( res . ) Nitzan Alon had set up a special apparatus near the Gaza border for taking in hostages presuming Hamas follows through with the terms of the war pause . & nbsp;That apparatus is highly organized both in terms of special medical and psychological staff as well as helicopters and other heavy weaponry to ensure security.Besides those developments , due to the war pause being delayed , the IDF continued attacks on Hamas on Thursday in Jabalia and Zeitoun , northeast areas which it only turned its attention to late last week after having already taken over central Gaza City.The IDF said it had found more weapons hidden in children's beds , mosaues , and other civilian locations , as it had previously in other parts of Gaza.If the war pause ends in the next 4-10 days , the IDF would be expected to spend some days or up to a week finishing with Hamas in Jabalia and Zeitoun as well as taking on Hamas in the tough Shejaiya neighborhood where some of the harshest battles were fought in 2014.The IDF would also need to eventually invade Khan Younis and Rafah , among other Hamas southern strongholds , which could take more time to subdue .",idf arrests director of gaza's shifa hospital

Guterres has been a strong advocate of a two-state resolution to the conflict and reaffirmed that stance at the meeting . & ldquo;The secretary-general reaffirms the UN commitment to supporting the parties to achieve a just and peaceful solution to the conflict , including through the Middle East Quartet and the establishment of two states , based on 1967 lines , with Jerusalem as the capital of both states , & rdquo ; Dujarric said . This would be & ldquo;in line with UN resolutions , international law and previous agreements , & rdquo ; he said . Friday&rsquo;s meeting marked the end of a series of high-level conversations among a small group of Israelis and Palestinians last week in Washington and New York . They met with US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and the nominee for assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs , Barbara Leaf , as well a number of Democratic members of Congress and the Senate , including Sen .

The UN head said the plan could perhaps help revive the peace process , and he expressed regret at the absence of negotiations . Beilin said he had asked Guterres if he would include the confederation plan in his talking points with leaders in the region and if he could help the group use the UN platform for debates and discourse on the confederation . & ldquo;He [ Guterres ] promised that in his talks with his interlocutors , as he said , he will raise this option of a confederation , & rdquo ; Beilin said , adding that separately , & ldquo;for the first time after many years , [ Guterres said ] he can have a dialogue with the Israeli government . & rdquo ; Brig . - Gen .

When they met with Sherman , she was particularly interested in the section about settlers remaining in their homes , given that the issue of evacuating the settlements is one of the most difficult ones on the road to peace , Beilin said . Sherman did not endorse the plan , but she said it was productive and that they had & ldquo;not given up&rdquo ; and were trying to find a realistic path to peace , he said . The Holy Land Confederation plan proposes a European Union-style confederation of an independent Israeli and Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders as outlined by the 2003 Geneva Initiative . This new plan is not formally connected to the initiative or to the organization that continues to promote it . Beilin was instrumental in the formation of the 1993 Oslo Accords and the Geneva Initiative , which he has incorporated into his latest endeavor . Among the distinct features of the plan is a joint Israeli-Palestinian narrative of the history of both peoples . The plan also provides a blueprint by which settlers would remain in their homes as residents but not citizens of a Palestinian state . In exchange , a similar number of Palestinians would be allowed to live in Israel as residents but not citizens . Beilin and Husseini have published their plan at a time when few Israelis and Palestinians are pursuing talks . The formal peace process has been frozen for almost eight years . Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has been blunt about his opposition to the creation of a Palestinian state , and US President Joe Biden has not spoken of any intention to put forward a peace process at this time .",guterres lauds efforts of israeli-palestinian confederation plan authors
2024-03-08 07:23:49.263,jpost,"■ FOR MANY years anyone speaking of The Voice of Israel was referring to Israel Public Radio & ndash ; and some broadcasters still do.But since October 7 , the & ldquo;Voice&rdquo ; of Israel has become Michal Herzog , the wife of President Isaac Herzog . Although many people have spoken out against the cruel , inhuman conduct of Hamas , particularly the brutal attacks on women by Hamas sadists , few have spoken out as frequently or in as many influential circles as Michal Herzog , who has made eliminating violent sexual abuse and the use of women and children as weapons of war as her cause.She brings the subject up in conversation at every opportunity and does not allow her listeners to forget that the key victims are those Israeli women abducted by Hamas . & ldquo;They cannot cry out for themselves , & rdquo ; she tells her audience . & ldquo;We have to be their voice . We have to cry out for them . & rdquo ; She has heard the most shocking and heart-breaking stories about these women , and she has ample opportunity to speak out on their behalf during the month of International Women&rsquo;s Day , as her schedule includes somewhere in the range of a dozen events in various parts of the country & ndash ; and she is invited to speak at all of them.Among those that she attended this week was one hosted by the Israel Building Center ( IBC ) in Netanya , where other speakers focused on different aspects of the construction and housing industry , such as architecture , neighborhood , marketing , interior d&eacute;cor , the psychology of the decision-making process and more . The event attended by numerous women executives who represented varied careers , was moderated by Ilanit Melchior , who before she became head of strategy at IBC was the longtime director of tourism at the Jerusalem Development Authority , with considerable experience in both public and private sectors.She reminded Herzog that she had said of her when she entered the President&rsquo;s Residence as the wife of the President of the State that there was no-one better suited to be Israel&rsquo;s first lady . What has happened in the interim vindicates that opinion , said Melchior.Not to be outdone , IBC chairman Eran Rolls , who was one of a handful of men who were present , declared that Isaac Herzog was the best president in Israel&rsquo;s history.In keeping with the occasion , Rolls was pleased to see women in executive positions in every field.Although this was indeed something to celebrate , the fact that there were Israeli hostages who were unable to celebrate , remained paramount in everyone&rsquo;s consciousness . On every seat , there was a yellow tulip & ndash ; a flower whose petals are usually closed just as the hostages are in closure . Yellow , of course , symbolizes the readiness to welcome the hostages when they eventually return home.Launching the Oxford Israel Alumni Society ( OIAS ) & nbsp ; ■ A CELEBRATION of another kind is also being held in Israel today , March 8 . British ambassador Simon Walters will host the launch of the Oxford Israel Alumni Society ( OIAS ) at a reception at his residence in Ramat Gan . It&rsquo;s not just because he represents the UK in Israel . He also happens to be an Oxford alumnus.The OIAS is an official alumni club representing the University of Oxford in Israel.More than 600 Israelis have enrolled at Oxford in recent decades.The University is consistently ranked among the top universities worldwide . Despite the relatively large number of Oxford alumni ( including immigrants ) living in Israel , there has not been an active official alumni society in the country in recent years.Among the people attending the society&rsquo;s opening function will be Anita Leviant , president of the Israel-UK Chamber of Commerce , and Neta Gruber Perry , director at the Innovation Authority , who will each speak on Israel&rsquo;s contributions to impact investing , focusing on the health and climate sectors.The University of Oxford Alumni Board has officially appointed attorney Simon Kotlerman , Dr . Aviv Yehezkel and Tomer Amir to head the Israel Society . Kotlerman is a social entrepreneur and business development manager ; Yehezkel is cofounder of the cybersecurity start-up Cynamics ; and Amir , is a technology expert . All three are alumni of the prestigious Sa&iuml;d Business School . Within merely a month , since getting started , they have managed to attract more than 100 Oxford graduates as founding members . & rdquo;It is with great excitement that we inaugurate the Oxford Israel Alumni Society , a vital part of Oxford&rsquo;s worldwide alumni network , & rdquo ; said Kotlerman . & ldquo;This society is set to become a key venue for collaborative projects and enhancing relations within our global community . & rdquo;Yehezkel sees the Society as a vital channel for strengthening Israel-UK relations . & ldquo;By bringing together alumni from various fields in Israel , the society aims to create a supportive community and provide a distinctive channel for reinforcing the Israeli ecosystem through connections with the UK , & rdquo ; he said.The 96-year-old who shows up in uniform when needed ■ TECHNICALLY , ISRAELIS who have served in the IDF , are automatically part of the Reserve forces and are called up for duty up to the age of 40 , though many keep going much longer . But it&rsquo;s doubtful that anyone can beat the record of Ezra Yachin , 96 , who still shows up in his uniform whenever he feels there is a need.During the period of the British Mandate , he was an underground fighter and belonged to Lehi , a right-wing paramilitary organization . Once Independence was declared , he was a combatant in most of the wars in which Israel was engaged , and after that took on other military assignments.This week he joined other active and veteran reservists at the President&rsquo;s Residence , where President Herzog who is a history buff was possibly more interested in meeting Yachin than the latter was in meeting the president . American media outlets discovered Yachin many years ago and have featured him several times on television and in newspapers and magazines.Jerusalem's upcoming Biennale ■ AMONG THE exhibitors in the upcoming Jerusalem Biennale running in the capital from March 25 to April 29 and directed by Ram Ozeri , is internationally-known photographer Joan Roth , whose works will be among thirty exhibitions of varying art forms that collectively come under the heading of contemporary Jewish art.Roth&rsquo;s exhibition , which includes some of her early works , actually opens earlier and goes on display at the Black Box Gallery on March 11.More than half a century ago , Roth set herself a photographic mission to make Jewish women visible.Judging by the tribute she received from the late Alice Shalvi , the founder of the Israel Women&rsquo;s Network , and author with her late husband of an encyclopedia of Jewish women , Roth has obviously succeeded.Shalvi wrote : & ldquo;Joan Roth has the gift for seeing the significant moment , the meaningful gesture , the fleeting look which conveys an in-depth character , a lifetime of experience , an entire culture . . . Joan&rsquo;s gaze is a female gaze and , in the capacity to penetrate below the surface to the essence of women&rsquo;s lives , it is a feminist gaze which does not objectify but rather empathizes , sympathizes , identifies with the subjects of her work&rdquo ; . For this exhibition , Roth has blown up photographs that were originally printed in a considerably smaller size , The new dimension also creates new impressions.Assaf Granit set to be kosher&nbsp ; ■ CELEBRITY CHEF Assaf Granit and his partner Uri Navon are finally going to be kosher . After all the non-kosher restaurants that their Mahaneh Yehuda group has opened in Israel , London , and Paris in the past , their upcoming venture in Jerusalem&rsquo;s Rehavia neighborhood will be , according to a report in Yediot Aharonot , a kosher dairy and fish restaurant . But that&rsquo;s not all . The restaurant will be integral to a 22-room boutique hotel , which will be their first step into the hotel industry . The hotel will be housed in the Molcho building which is a protected heritage site . & nbsp;greerfc@gmail.com","grapevine , march 8 , 2024 : the voice of israel"
2021-02-07 21:22:58.777,jpost,"& nbsp;Israel&rsquo;s right to self-defense and to its ancient biblical capital of Jerusalem suffered a blow on Friday when an International Criminal Court ( ICC ) ruling advanced the possibility of war crimes suits against Israelis . & nbsp ; & ldquo;If the International Criminal Court is making a list of so-called Israeli [ war crimes ] suspects , I ask that my name be put a the top of that list , & rdquo ; Yamina party head Naftali Bennett said on Sunday . & nbsp ; It was not just a statement of bravado against the highest international criminal judiciary body . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; As a former defense minister , there is a very real possibility that he could one day be targeted by the court . & nbsp ; For the Palestinians , the ICC ruling offered a ray of hope to hold Israel accountable for alleged human rights abuses . & nbsp ; Upon hearing of the ruling , Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh responded by stating that perpetrators of crimes will & ldquo;not go unpunished . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; For many Israelis the idea that the court plans to target them with respect to actions in Gaza and Israeli settlement activity , but has not held human rights abusers in Iran , Syria and or China accountable , speaks to the continued bias of international organizations against the Jewish state . & nbsp ; & nbsp ; But how real is the possibility of war crimes suits ? Who would be targeted and for what ? & nbsp ; & nbsp ; How harmful or helpful was the ruling to either Israel or the Palestinian Authority , which first turned to the court in 2015 and asked that it adjudicate war crimes suits ? & nbsp ; 1 . Is the probe only focused on Israel ? & nbsp ; No . The ICC will examine actions by both Israeli and Palestinians , including Hamas . But the probe was launched at the request of Palestinians and is expected to overwhelmingly focus on activities by Israelis against Palestinians . & nbsp ; 2 . Can all Israeli and or Palestinians actions be considered war crimes ? & nbsp ; No . The ICC will examine activities that occurred since June 13 , 2014 . The scope of the probe is also limited to only those incidents which occurred over the pre-1967 lines in east Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza . This includes Jerusalem&rsquo;s Old City , the Western Wall and the Temple Mount , known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif . Israelis are liable for such actions , even though Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute which governs the ICC . The Palestinian Authority , in contrast , signed the statute in 2015 . & nbsp ; 3 . What three mains issue will the ICC likely probe ? & nbsp ; The first is the 2014 Gaza war , including the question of disproportionate attacks by the IDF and indiscriminate rocket attacks by armed Palestinian groups in Gaza , including Hamas . & nbsp ; The second is IDF use of lethal force against the Hamas-led & ldquo;Great March of Return&rdquo ; along the Gaza border , which began in March 2018 and ended in December 2019 . & nbsp ; Third , the ICC would also look at the issue of whether settlement activity in the West Bank and Jewish building in east Jerusalem , since that June 2014 date , could be considered a war crime . Israel&rsquo;s razing of Palestinian structures could be examined tangentially , but not as the main focus . & nbsp ; Other incidents since that date could also be probed in the future , but the main immediate thrust is expected to be these three issues . & nbsp ; 4 . Is the state and or individual Israelis at risk ? & nbsp ; Both . On the policy level , Israel fears that a negative ruling on matters relating to Gaza would ultimately raise questions about Israel&rsquo;s right to self-defense and make it difficult for the IDF to operate against threats to the state and its citizens , particularly on Israel&rsquo;s southern border . & nbsp ; A negative ruling on settlements and Jewish building in east Jerusalem , Israel fears , would undercut its legal claims to historical and religious rights to its ancient Biblical territory and its legal claims to be indigenous to that territory . & nbsp ; If the Palestinians are successful at the ICC , then Israeli activity in both its biblical heartland of Judea and Samaria , otherwise known as the West Bank , and in its ancient capital of Jerusalem , would be a war crime . & nbsp ; The security cabinet mentioned the absurdity of both claims when it issued a statement against the ICC ruling on Sunday . & nbsp ; On the individual level , war crimes suits could be leveled against people and not the state . This means that leaders such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense ministers Moshe Ya&rsquo;alon , who held that post during the 2014 Gaza War , and Avigdor Liberman , who was defense minister when the Great March began . Defense Minister Benny Gantz and his predecessor Bennett could also be targeted along with individual soldiers and commanders . & nbsp ; 5 . What was Friday&rsquo;s ruling and why did it matter ? & nbsp ; The ICC&rsquo;s Pre-Trial Chamber ruled 2-1 that the court&rsquo;s&nbsp;Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda had the jurisdiction to open an investigation into potential Israeli and Palestinian war crimes on territory over the pre-1967 lines in the West Bank , Gaza and east Jerusalem . Jurisdiction was one of the earliest and most global grounds on which the threat of an ICC war crimes suit could have been averted both on the issue of Gaza and the settlements , had the three judges ruled against jurisdiction . & nbsp ; Their decision in support of jurisdiction can&rsquo;t be appealed at this stage . The argument against jurisdiction can only be reopened at a later phase in the process , once individual charges have been filed to the court for approval . & nbsp ; 6 . Did the court&rsquo;s jurisdictional ruling include recognition of Palestine as a state ? & nbsp ; No . The Pre-Trial Chamber specifically stated that such a move was outside of its purview , but it said that it could be considered as such solely for the purpose of these issues of adjudicating war crimes . & nbsp ; The basis of its ruling strengthened the status of de facto Palestinian statehood and the role of the United Nations in determining that status . The ruling upgraded the significance of the 2012 UN General Assembly Resolution that granted the Palestinians the status of a non-member state by legitimizing the de facto status it granted the PA to have the right of member states to sign UN treaties and statues , including the Rome Statute . It was that signature which opened the possibility of war crimes suits . & nbsp ; The Pre-Trial Chamber also relied on the text of that resolution to set the territory on which it had jurisdiction . It was a move that upgraded the legal status and impact of such resolutions , particularly with respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . & nbsp ; 7 . How significant was the dissenting opinion ? & nbsp ; ICC Judge P&eacute;ter Kov&aacute;cs disagreed with his two other peers ; Reine Ad&eacute;la&iuml;de Sophie Alapini-Gansou and Marc Perrin de Brichambau , as well as with Bensouda herself . He said that Palestine could not be considered a de facto state for the purposes of the tribunal and that the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction could not be fully extended to Gaza , the West Bank and east Jerusalem . & nbsp ; He took particular issue with the reliance his peers and Bensouda placed on the UNGA&rsquo;s 2012 resolution , which he said was non-binding and did not carry the legal weight attributed to it . & nbsp ; In a strongly worded 168-page option , that was longer than the original 60-page one issued by the Pre-Trial chamber , he brought into evidence statements by PA officials themselves as well as the UN , to the effect that Palestine is not yet considered to be a state . & nbsp ; Kov&aacute;cs arguments lend legal weight to Israel&rsquo;s contention that Palestine cannot be considered a state . They reflect a lack of legal unanimity on the issue with the court and can be used later to bolster appeals claims . & nbsp ; 8 . What are the next steps ? & nbsp ; Bensouda would inform the parties and the court that she has opened an investigation , at which time they would have 30 days to respond . & nbsp ; & nbsp;Among the critical aspects of her investigation is the question of whether the Israelis or the Palestinians have adjudicated or would adjudicate issues with regard to Gaza and the settlements , according to Israel Democracy Institute Vice President of Research and legal expert Prof . Yuval Shany . The ICC is called into play often only in situations where the national court system is non-existent or has not addressed the pertinent issues , he explained . & nbsp ; It is at this stage that Israeli probes or potential probes into criminal activity by its soldiers in Gaza could sway Bensouda not to move forward on war crimes allegations with regard to Gaza , Shany said . & nbsp ; Israel has not simultaneously held criminal investigations into settlement activity & ndash ; which it considers to be legal & ndash ; and thus Bensouda is likely to move the matter of settlements forward to the phase of individual criminal charges . & nbsp ; Those charges against individuals either with respect to Gaza or the settlements must be confirmed with the court . It is at that phase that individuals charged could appeal , including on jurisdictional grounds , Shany said . & nbsp ; The timing of the matter is likely to be crucial , since Bensouda&rsquo;s term as chief prosecutor is slated to end in June and a new prosecutor will make decisions on the case .",eight things to know about the icc war crimes suits against israel
2024-05-21 00:16:21.057,jpost,"It truly feels like we are living inside a chapter of the Bible . Yesterday , when news started to come in about the crash of the Iranian president's helicopter , I saw that some people were quoting the verse from the Book of Proverbs , written by King Solomon : "" When the wicked perish , there is joy . "" When righteous people perish from the world , we are sad , and unfortunately , this happened a great deal since October 7th . But on the other hand , here is an opportunity to rejoice . When the wicked perish from the world & ndash ; there is joy in the world ; it is cleaner , purer , and better here without them.But there is another verse , the last verse of the Haftarah , that will be read in synagogues during this coming Shabbat : "" Behold , I am the Lord , the God of all flesh ; is there anything too hard for Me ? "" We are used to asking , "" What will be ? "" and getting answers from panels of retired commentators and experts . This verse reminds us that we do not exclusively determine the plot , and with all due respect to the experts & ndash ; reality often surprises.Sometimes , unfortunately , we have difficult scenarios . Still , sometimes , events amaze us for the better : the progression of history toward a positive direction of success that we hadn't even imagined.May we be blessed with many more good news stories far beyond what we expected.Has anyone given you anything to pass along?In the airport , on my way back from London , I was asked the usual question by the customs agent : & ldquo;Has anyone handed you anything to give to anyone ? & rdquo;And the truth is that my answer is a resounding & ldquo;Yes ! & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;Someone&rdquo ; has given me something precious : an abundance of support , concern , love , prayer , and feelings of unity from the Jewish community of London directly to Israel.It was a privilege to be among the 40 speakers from Israel to travel to Britain on behalf of & ldquo;Mizrachi UK&rdquo ; It was a privilege to see how the huge turmoil since October 7th has inspired people to do more : One person is making aliya ; another is organizing a rally ; someone else is organizing a special prayer service , and challah bake ; another is bringing the families of hostages to speak here , and yet another is raising funds and organizing solidarity missions to Israel.Yael Jackson , from the London suburb of Borehamwood , helped organize an event attended by many more people than expected ( as usual , they were looking for more chairs ! ) .

Then and there , Muzi decided to make all the necessary changes so that his restaurant would be eligible for kosher certification . Since then , he&rsquo;s delighted tens of thousands of customers in northern Israel with his offerings.Disproving all the naysayers , six months later , when it was time to renew his kosher certification , Muzi announced to all that he was continuing to run the restaurant according to the laws of kashrut and Shabbat . & ldquo;I always served fantastically delicious food , and it was actually kosher , & rdquo ; Muzi wrote to me . & ldquo;The only obstacle to receiving kosher certification was that the business was open on Shabbat .

2021-10-29 11:04:31.177,jpost,"Six months after Operation Guardian of the Walls , the defense establishment is preparing as it expects Hamas to try and damage the border fence between the Gaza Strip and the southern border by blowing up car bombs , infiltrating Israeli territory and hitting soldiers . In an exercise held this week in the Gaza Division , the forces practiced such scenarios , including an infiltration into Israeli territory . The aboveground barrier , made of steel , is about 65 km long and six meters high . It will extend from Zikim Beach to the Kerem Shalom crossing and its purpose is to prevent terrorists from entering Israeli territory from aboveground . The defense establishment believes that Hamas leaders understood , as part of the conclusions drawn from Operation Guardian of the Walls , that alongside the attack tunnels , which its people continue to invest in , the organization must develop additional options for operations that it has used effectively in the past , but abandoned in recent years . The security tensions and stalemate in talks with Hamas over an agreement for calm and a prisoner swap agreement , mediated by Egypt , could push the organization to take action against Israel . According to evaluations , as part of operational orders for when the order is given , Hamas members are training for raids and infiltrations into Israeli territory as well as the use of large explosive vehicles . As mentioned , the defense establishment is aware of the fact that Hamas is investing a lot of effort in digging new defensive and attack tunnels and in rehabilitating the tunnels damaged in the operation . It is estimated that the route of the attack tunnels is approaching the barrier area , although no tunnel out into Israeli territory is known . Israel has noticed that in recent months Hamas has been making a major effort to rehabilitate and improve its military capabilities , as a lesson from the operation in which its men found it difficult to hit IDF soldiers and targets along the border . Among the areas in which Hamas is investing are : cyber warfare , unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) , various airspace methods and anti-tank weapons . The IDF believes that the terrorist organization is not currently interested in a military confrontation due to the need to rehabilitate the Gaza Strip and its military capabilities . The defense establishment has identified a large presence of Hamas restraining forces in order to prevent clashes with the IDF . Recently , Hamas forces even aggressively arrested Palestinian Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) terrorist operatives , in order to maintain stability in the region at this stage . In Israel , it is believed that incidents that may occur in security prisons , such as the death of a hunger striking PIJ prisoner , could lead to a terrorist attack and it is estimated that the PIJ is already preparing to carry out attacks . On the other hand , in recent months , Hamas leaders have repeatedly sent messages to the leadership of the PIJ that if the organization acts contrary to the position of the joint factions , its people will not receive military assistance from Hamas , as has already happened twice in recent years .",hamas may try to attack the border fence in next round of fighting

2021-05-14 08:24:26.737,jpost,"Iron Dome always had a weakness . It shot down 85 % - 90 % of Hamas rockets in past rounds of battle & ndash ; and that was out of the ones which were projected to land in populated areas . As long as the volume of rockets Hamas could shoot in a single salvo was small , this was almost a hermetic defense . But Israeli intelligence and national security officials had long warned that Hezbollah had a sufficient number of rockets to pound the Jewish state with over 1,000 rockets in a day , an amount that could pierce the Iron Dome shield . This was one reason the IDF has been so careful when it came to Hezbollah . The terror group has 150,000 or more rockets , including hundreds of advanced ones , which means that 1,000 per day wouldn&rsquo;t even dent its arsenal . Has Hamas now found its own way to undermine Iron Dome ? During the 2014 Gaza War , Hamas fired almost 4,000 rockets , but that was spread out over 50 days . It usually fired dozens of rockets in a day at most , and spread them out over the day . Its high was around 200 rockets spread over a whole day & ndash ; and out of the 50 days of the war , it fired more than 100 rockets per day for only around two weeks . Also , the vast majority of these rockets were fired at the Gaza corridor since Hamas had a limited number of rockets capable of reaching Tel Aviv and other areas . For more on rocket attacks against Israel&nbsp;read here For more on Israeli strikes on Gaza&nbsp;read here For more on live rocket attack updates&nbsp;read here For more on riots in Israel&nbsp;read here For more on world reactions to Gaza violence&nbsp;read here & nbsp ; But on Tuesday and Wednesday morning , Hamas appeared to succeed in firing more than 100 rockets within minutes , including a sizable number focused on Tel Aviv . This is a jump both in the number of rockets being used against Tel Aviv , and in the terrorist group&rsquo;s ability to fire a high volume of rockets simultaneously . This is an ability that Hezbollah was known to have , but was thought to be some time away still for Hamas . DOES THIS mean the Iron Dome is no longer effective ? No . It still intercepts the majority of rockets fired at Israeli population centers although some are getting through . The bigger question is whether Israeli intelligence estimates are correct that Hamas has only a few hundred missiles which can reach Tel Aviv . If those estimates are accurate , then Hamas may have used up a large chunk of that arsenal , even if it has thousands more which can hit Beersheba , Ashdod and communities near the Gaza border . But if Hamas has more of those longer-range rockets , this could impact Israel&rsquo;s plans for this round of violence and especially the question of how long it wants it to last . If Hamas can pierce the missile shield with 100 rockets in a few minutes twice in one day , how much more damage can Hezbollah and Iran do with the longer , larger and more accurate missiles it possesses ? Israeli decision-makers and military strategists will need to take this into account in deciding how long this can go on for and how quickly they will need to either escalate with a ground offensive to reduce Hamas rocket fire ( clearly the IDF&rsquo;s extensive bombing on Tuesday did not succeed in that sufficiently ) or to find its way to a ceasefire more quickly and make new plans for the next round . The IDF will also need to rethink the speed with which it will need to move in a conflict with Hezbollah , let alone Iran .",is iron dome effective against hamas rockets as originally thought ?

Participants in the demonstrations often dress in clothing that some consider revealing , and event organizers emphasize that there is no dress code.To adjust the event to the difficult times that the country is facing , the walk will be held in a different format this year , said organizers , with participants gathering at Zion Square in Jerusalem for a ceremony in which they will read out the names of the women who were murdered this year , before gathering at a local bar for speeches and discussion circles.More needed than ever&ldquo;This year , sexual violence and gender-based violence are closing in on us from all directions and we need the march more than ever , & rdquo ; said the organizers . & ldquo;It was not simple for us to organize the march this year when there is so much pain and so many causes to fight for around us . Alongside that , it was clear to us that we could not back down . & rdquo ; & ldquo;So we are here & ndash ; here to voice our outcry , to hurt together , to demand another reality .

But time and again , we have seen the power of people who believe in those values to overcome the worst in human nature . That is America&rsquo;s story & ndash ; it is Israel&rsquo;s story & ndash ; it&rsquo;s the story of the free world and it endures because it connects to something deep within the human spirit that no government , and no terrorist group , can kill . & rdquo;Seated at the roundtable were mayors from all sectors , Jewish and Arab alike , including Tzvika Brot of Bat Yam ; Rafik Halabi of Daliat al-Carmel ; Miriam Fierberg of Netanya ; Mazen Ghnaim of Sakhnin ; Rotem Yadlin of Gezer Regional Council ; and Raed Daka of Baka al-Gharbiya.The group gathered at the Bloomberg Sagol Center for City Leadership at Tel Aviv University to discuss a & ldquo;new program that will help bring world-class expertise to support 65 localities , & rdquo ; according to Bloomberg.Tel Aviv University President Prof . Ariel Porat said , & ldquo;The Israeli government failed to provide its citizens with all kinds of different services . The municipalities could and should play an important role . & rdquo;Indeed , the program intends to see the development of regional innovation hubs designed to serve each cluster&rsquo;s communities and their respective municipalities and help them rebuild stronger , with particular focus on the hardest-hit regions rather than individual cities because & ldquo;regional dependency and interdependence amongst communities is such a big priority , & rdquo ; according to James Anderson , who established and leads the Government Innovation program at Bloomberg Philanthropies and is the architect of the organization&rsquo;s work supporting mayoral leadership and driving local innovation in Israel.Speaking to the Post , he said communities & ldquo;really want our support . . . to enable and encourage that sort of regional thinking as communities build back better . & rdquo;The focus of Bloomberg PhilanthropiesBloomberg Philanthropies will focus specifically on bringing resources and capabilities in data science , the digitization of public services , program design , and collaboration management to develop and implement projects emphasizing recovery , resilience , and regional connectivity.The mayors and municipal heads in attendance , in a closed-door discussion , raised questions and concerns that may be met through the initiative , and in turn , Bloomberg&rsquo;s team of professionals is taking feedback , applying necessary customizations , and initiating customized programs specifically to help each affected area.Anderson said , & ldquo;The government innovation program at Bloomberg Philanthropies really comes from Mike and the fact that he is the only major funder on the globe , who also happened to have been a mayor&rdquo ; and therefore & ldquo;understands the unique role mayors can play in moving us forward at the community level , at the national level , at the global level . & ldquo;We started our work in Israel 10 years ago , we brought our Bloomberg innovation model to Tel Aviv , Jerusalem Beersheba , and . . . all three of those cities do extraordinary things with that investment , & rdquo ; Anderson explained , adding that they are developing new programs according to the needs of cities around the world , and this is informing their choices in Israel , whether they learned it in Kyiv due to the Russia-Ukraine war or in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Sandy last decade.Bloomberg revealed that & ldquo;outside of the United States , we do more work with mayors in Israel than in any other country in the world & ndash ; and that&rsquo;s something that I know would&rsquo;ve made my mother and father very proud . It&rsquo;s times like this & ndash ; times of crisis and conflict , when people are deeply worried about the future & ndash ; that mayors are more important than ever . & rdquo;Indeed , Bloomberg&rsquo;s personal experience in the centrality of mayoral leadership in times of crisis informed plenty of his work with mayoral programs through Bloomberg Philanthropies.Bloomberg was mayor of New York City from the beginning of 2002 , shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001 , during which four coordinated Islamist suicide terrorist attacks were carried out by al-Qaeda against the US , including two planes crashing into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center . & ldquo;I learned very quickly that mayors have a unique opportunity to be beacons of hope & ndash ; and to rally people behind a shared vision that unites people of all backgrounds and all religions , & rdquo ; Bloomberg said . & ldquo;They also have a powerful role to play in helping communities recover and rebuild and to show residents that even in a crisis , government can work for them and get things done , whether that&rsquo;s building infrastructure or getting families back in their homes and schools . & rdquo ;",michael bloomberg launches regional innovation hubs in war-stricken israeli cities - exclusive

2022-02-15 19:49:15.437,jpost,"Israel needs a peace authority to pursue and maintain relations with its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians , former Israeli negotiator Gilead Sher told the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee on Tuesday . & ldquo;This authority will handle only peace , and peace-making and peace-preserving , & rdquo ; Sher told The Jerusalem Post after the meeting , adding that this new body would have & ldquo;one mission statement . & rdquo ; This would be an independent authority with a commissioner that would be appointed by the Knesset , Sher said . He explained that this was different from other governmental bodies such as the Foreign Ministry , the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office or the National Security Council , which handles a myriad of tasks . & ldquo;This is a fresh new idea that is completely detached from politics of Left and Right , & rdquo ; said Sher . & ldquo;This relates to the very basic fundamentals of the establishment of the State of Israel with a Declaration of Independence of 1948 , which expressly says that Israel will seek peace and extend its arms toward its neighbors for peace and security . & rdquo ; Sher has a long history with peace processes , having served as an attorney and chief of staff for former prime minister Ehud Barak , as well as a negotiator for both Barak and former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin . Israel needs to move beyond the paradigm of dealing with peace only as a necessary pursuit when the opportunity opens and make it a permanent part of its national agenda , Sher said . Israel should & ldquo;not be satisfied with short-time , ad-hoc administrations whenever there is an opportunity to do something , & rdquo ; he said . During past peace processes , he noted , there were temporary mechanisms that were established and then dismantled . During the 2007 Annapolis process , there was even & ldquo;a peace administration , & rdquo ; but & ldquo;it was a very short-term administration without any continuity of the collective memory and the data that was processed . & rdquo ; A Peace Authority , Sher said , would allow for a kind of continuity that is not absent . & ldquo;This is a stable permanent body that would become one of the most important bodies in the state of Israel , & rdquo ; he said . Sher spoke at a time when the peace process with the Palestinians has been frozen for almost eight years . It is also a time when Israel has advanced peace with its neighbors under the rubric of the Abraham Accords , establishing ties with the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Morocco and Sudan . Sher said that the peace authority would work to shore up those relations as well as Israel&rsquo;s peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan . In addition , it would prepare for normalized ties with additional Arab countries . A senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies , Sher said this plan was his initiative , and that when he put it forward , he did not represent any specific organization . He spoke during a meeting in which the FADC listened to proposals on how to advance Israeli-Palestinian relations and heard summaries of pending problem areas . MK Gaby Lasky ( Meretz ) told the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that she could not recall when such a forum had been convened . Lasky said the idea for an administration or a peace authority could be put into place fairly quickly . It has been a mistake to rely so heavily on a military body to represent Israel in its ties with the Palestinian Authority . It would be important for a civilian body to exist that would upgrade Israel&rsquo;s ties with the PA , Lasky said .","israel needs a peace authority , former negotiator tells knesset"

Her 10-year-old son , Neidav , was diagnosed with leukemia in December , and they had been living at Schneider & ndash ; Children&rsquo;s Medical Center while he received treatment . & nbsp;I met Meirav at the Zichron Menachem annual four-wheeling trip , now in its 11th year . The Land Rover tour was located in the Ben Shemen Forest , an area full of trees , fields , and rocky terrain . Our Land Rover was number 13 . Our driver&rsquo;s name was Zion , and he only had one hand . He lost his other hand in an accident in the IDF . He said he doesn&rsquo;t let it stop him from living his life . & nbsp;As we drove over the rocks embedded in the ground , I asked Meirav about Neidav . Meirav has four children ; her oldest is 17 . Their family lives in Beit Aryeh . & nbsp;The week before the trip , Neidav finished his treatment . & ldquo;We beat cancer , we beat it , & rdquo ; Meirav said proudly . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Neidav is 10 , but has a mind like a 50-year-old , & rdquo ; she said . She recounted that throughout his treatment he had stayed positive , with the understanding that there was no other option but to fight . & nbsp ; & ldquo;It was all in the head ; there was no other option but to win . & rdquo ; Meirav said he knew everything that was going on , and his siblings knew as well.When they learned that Neidav was going to lose his hair , the family threw a party . His brother , Be&rsquo;eri , and his father both decided to shave their heads with Neidav so he wouldn&rsquo;t be alone.Be&rsquo;eri sat with us in the Land Rover . However , Neidav was not with us because he had a fever . Part of the effects of leukemia is an extremely weak immune system . As a result of this , Neidav has not been able to attend school . Meirav believes he will catch up , though . She said that Neidav is very smart . & ldquo;He learned English all by himself from TV shows , & rdquo ; she said proudly . & nbsp;Neidav had to undergo chemotherapy for five months . His mother confided that it had been an extremely difficult time , but that Neidav had continuously tried to be positive . Now that the treatment is over , they can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel . & nbsp;When we got out of the Land Rover , there was a barbecue waiting for us with all types of meat , salad , and chips . All the kids were handed water guns , along with the volunteers & ndash ; who were either in high school or doing National Service . During the water fight , nobody was spared . Then , the volunteers led the kids in songs I knew from summer camp . One young man had drums , and others held children on their shoulders . They all stood in a circle singing and dancing while their parents sat around , talking and relaxing . There were kids of all ages , ranging from all sectors of Israeli society , from secular to haredi.As I stood watching , I was approached by Tomer Baum , a parent I had spoken on the early morning bus ride from Schneider Hospital in Petah Tikva to the forest . & nbsp;Tomer had told me about his son Yair , who is 13 years old and was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in December 2023 . Yair was at a summer camp in the United States , but Tomer brought his son Aviv on the Land Rover tour . While Yair had been undergoing treatment at Sheba Medical Center , Aviv was very scared and stressed , Tomer explained . & nbsp;Yair&rsquo;s treatment lasted six months . In addition to chemo , Yair&rsquo;s doctors also attempted additional treatments . Tomer talked about the scariest day at this hospital for him , when the doctors tried to give Yair a & ldquo;biologic&rdquo ; treatment . When the nurses left the room , Yair stopped breathing , Tomer recalled . & ldquo;He turned purple . & rdquo ; It turned out that Yair was having an allergic reaction to the medicine , causing the doctors to immediately cease the treatment . For Tomer , it was the & ldquo;worst day ever . & rdquo;Now Yair is in remission , but the next five years are crucial , a period during which the disease could reappear . & nbsp;Tomer said that knowing Yair had a trip to the US to look forward to during his treatment had given him hope . As Aviv was also scared and stressed during his brother&rsquo;s treatment , this Land Rover trip was a way for him to have fun , relax , and be a kid , his father said.VolunteeringI ALSO spoke to Bram , a high school student who has been volunteering with Zichron Menachem for a year and a half . As well as going on trips and helping at summer camps , he also assists individual families . & nbsp;Bram told me about a family with five children that he began helping after the outbreak of the war with Hamas . The father was on reserve duty , and the mother was studying to be a doctor . One of the kids had cancer . & ldquo;It felt like the house was falling apart , & rdquo ; he shared . & ldquo;I was just trying to hold the house together . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Bram said that since the war began , there have not been enough volunteers , and many who used to travel to hospitals or to help individual families could no longer do so . & nbsp;Zichron Menachem has several hundred volunteers . The organization was founded 34 years ago by Chaim and Miri Ehrental , whose son Menachem battled cancer for over 14 years . According to the founders , the organization believes that the emotional well-being of his/her family is crucial to a child&rsquo;s healing process.Zichron Menachem runs a rehabilitative educational social day center , a hospitality center for families , study programs , and clubs and workshops & ndash ; as well as annual vacation camps abroad for children during winter and summer breaks , and a spring camp for parents of children with cancer . Zichron Menachem also offers family vacations and fun days throughout the year.Another aspect of the organization&rsquo;s activities is related to medical care . This includes organizing and funding various therapies and treatments , home assistance , a blood donor registry , wig-fitting , and more . Recently , it established a blood collection center for oncology patients . Additionally , for the past 12 years , in collaboration with the Pantene hair product brand , Zichron Menachem has been running the Hair for Hope project , which collects hair donations to provide free wigs for cancer patients.When I asked Bram why he continues to volunteer , his answer was : & ldquo;There is a lot of satisfaction . I can feel the effect I have on the kids . & rdquo ; & nbsp;He added that they also have an effect on him . & ldquo;I pay more attention to what I say . I&rsquo;ve become more emotionally intelligent , & rdquo ; he said . & nbsp;At the end of the trip , parents had to drag their kids home , sopping wet from the water fight . The volunteers , also sopping wet , grinned from ear to ear . They kept asking me , & ldquo;Did you have fun ? & rdquo ; & ldquo;Of course , & rdquo ; I replied . ",battling childhood cancer : four-wheeling with zichron menachem

Diplomats said initial foreign national evacuees were expected to travel by road to Cairo and fly out from there.Egypt's health ministry said 16 medical evacuees had been transferred to hospitals in the northern Sinai region , 11 to Al Arish and five to Bir al-Abd . Egypt has also prepared a field hospital at Sheikh Zuweid , 15 km ( 9 miles ) from Rafah , to treat evacuees from Gaza.US State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller said a number of those who left were American citizens , but that he would not provide a head count . There are some 400 US citizens who have expressed a desire to leave , which together with their family members would constitute a group of some 1,000 people , he said.US President Joe Biden , who has been heavily involved in securing their safe passage posted on X , & ldquo;Today , thanks to American leadership , we secured safe passage for wounded Palestinians and for foreign nationals to exit Gaza . & ldquo;We expect American citizens to exit today , and we expect to see more depart over the coming days . We won't let up working to get Americans out of Gaza.7 , & rdquo ; he stated . & nbsp;An ' important first step'US National Security Advisor spokesperson John Kirby told reporters on board & ldquo;Air Force One&rdquo ; that the existence of the foreigners from Gaza & ldquo;was an important first step&rdquo ; and & ldquo;a significant breakthrough . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;It is the direct result of weeks of effort and personal diplomacy by the President as well as the secretary of state and of course our special envoy on the ground David Satterfield , & rdquo ; Kirby said.Biden discussed the arrangement with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week . & nbsp ; & ldquo;The State Department has been in contact with US citizens in Gaza , telling them to be ready to leave and to await further instructions , & rdquo ; Kirby said.United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland said the exit of the foreigners was""An important step in the right direction , which we need to build on . & rdquo;Dr Fathi Abu al-Hassan , a U.S . passport holder , described hellish conditions inside Gaza without water , food or shelter .

"" Those require advanced surgeries that can't be done here because of the lack of capabilities , especially women and children , "" said Abu Taeema.The breakthrough comes as Israel and the international community explore avenues to secure the release of over 240 hostages Hamas took captive when they infiltrated southern Israel on October 7.The attack , during which Hamas killed over 1,400 people including by burning and dismembering them , sparked the Gaza War.Israel has since bombarded Gaza and has sent in ground troops as part of is campaign to oust Hamas from the enclave . The terror group has forcibly controlled Gaza since 2007.Hamas has asserted that over 8,500 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed from war-related violence . Israel has banned the entry of goods , food , medicine and fuel into Gaza through its passages , but has allowed a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the Strip through Rafah.The US has pushed for a plan that would allow for 100 trucks a day , but has yet to meet that goal , although the number continues to rise . Aid officials have said the goods are not enough to prevent a humanitarian crisis.At issue in particular has been Israel&rsquo;s ban on fuel , which it fears Hamas would divert for military purposes . Both the US and Israel have said that Hama has fuel that it could provide for humanitarian use.The international commuting has focused on the civilian cost of the war , particularly the harm done to hospitals and the Jabalia refugee camp as Israel battles a terror group whose infrastructure is located within a civilian population.Hospitals struggled to cope amid shutdowns forced by shortages in fuel , Medical student Ezzedine Lulu , working at Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza , filmed himself walking through corridors filled with sleeping children sheltering from the bombardment .

2024-04-20 14:26:57.280,jpost,"Pressure is mounting on the largely pro-Iran regime mayor of the German city of Freiburg , Martin Horn , to dissolve his municipal partnership with the heavily militarized city of Isfahan in Iran that last week played a key role in the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s massive aerial bombardment of the Jewish state.Some Iranians in Isfahan celebrated the aerial bombardment targeting Israel last week.Calls for Horn to end the twin city partnership grew after Iran&rsquo;s regime fired over 300 missiles and suicide drones at Israel . Isfahan is the main hub of Iran&rsquo;s missile production program and its illicit nuclear weapons apparatus.Lieutenant Colonel ( Retired ) Jonathan Conricus , who served as the Israeli army's international spokesperson from 2017 to 2023 , told the Jerusalem Post : "" I find it odd that a city still has a connection to an official institution from the Islamic Republic of Iran . Ending the partnership would send a message to the hostile Iranian regime that this city , like all German cities , adheres to German values . "" Dr . Efraim Zuroff , the world&rsquo;s leading Nazi-hunter and head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center&rsquo;s Jerusalem office , told the Post that the twin city partnership & ldquo;makes Freiburg looks a bunch of total idiots . & rdquo ; He said that & ldquo;To have a twin city agreement with a city in Iran does not make any sense . It encourages Iran to continue to do what they are doing&mdash;spreading death and destruction . & rdquo;Zuroff stressed that & ldquo;Freiburg is not in line with the general attitude in Germany . & rdquo;Addressing the Iranian peopleBen Sabti , who led the IDF Spokesperson&rsquo;s platforms in Persian , which was created to address the Iranian people directly , told the Post that & ldquo;Iranian drones were sent from Isfahan&rdquo ; to attack Israel.Sabti , who was born in Tehran and is research fellow for Institute for National Security Studies , added that in Isfahan & ldquo;There are many military bases&rdquo ; in & nbsp;Isfahan & nbsp;because it is in the heart & nbsp;of Ian and it is & ldquo;very secure&rdquo ; for Iran to place military installations in the central province of Isfahan.Israel , according to foreign media reports , on Friday launched a counter-strike against an air base in Isfahan and hit a key part of Iran's S-300 air defense system . The New York Times reported on Saturday.Freiburg is widely considered one of the most hospitable European cities for Iran&rsquo;s regime , which was classified as the world&rsquo;s largest state-sponsor of terrorism by the Biden administration . Zuroff noted that Isfahan is the & ldquo;center of nuclear weapons production&rdquo ; in Iran.The campaign to end the reported appeasement of Iran&rsquo;s regime by Freiburg&rsquo;s mayor , Martin Horn , and the left-wing Green and Social Democratic parties in the city council has been largely led by Iranian dissidents.Dr . Kazem Moussavi , a German-Iranian dissident who has campaigned against the partnerships since it was founded in 2000 , told the Post & ldquo;As an Iranian opposition activist and spokesman for the Green Party of Iran in Germany ( in exile ) , I have been warning Freiburg's respective mayors , now Martin Horn , and the city council for years , in vain , that Freiburg's relations with Isfahan are dangerous and a back door for the mullahs to spread their antisemitism and Islamism in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg and in all of Germany . & rdquo;Freiburg is a university town located in the southwestern German state of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg.Moussavi continued that & ldquo;However , they paid no attention to my protests and reports in the context of appeasement policy . They ignored that Isfahan is an execution center for opponents of the regime , the main base for uranium enrichment to produce nuclear bombs , ballistic missiles and drones , and to equip the war against Israel . It has now been proven that the Revolutionary Guard from Isfahan fired ballistic missiles at Israel . If these rockets had hit Israeli cities , it would have been an even more terrible crime than the Hamas October pogrom , for which the city of Freiburg would also be morally responsible . & rdquo;The well-known German-Iranian activist added & ldquo ; If Mayor Martin Horn and the Freiburg city councilors had reflected on these dangers and Israel's attack on military installations in Isfahan , they would have to resign immediately and break off Freiburg's relations with the city of Isfahan . This sister city partnership endangers Israel's security . & rdquo ; & nbsp;Sheina Vojoudi , who is an associate fellow at the Gold Institute for International Strategy , told the Post , & ldquo;Isfahan is of great strategic importance in Iran . There are military and nuclear bases in Isfahan and it shows how the regime is concentrated in this city and the rockets that were fired at Israel were also fired from one of the bases in Isfahan . Today's attack on Isfahan means that this city is one of the main points where the regime can pose a threat to Israel and of course to the Iranian people because of the intense activities of the IRGC . & rdquo;Voujoudi , who fled the Islamic Republic to Germany , added & ldquo;The regime's nuclear activities have almost ruined the lives of the people of Isfahan and increased the rate of cancer in Isfahan . Every nuclear activity of this regime , which is based on dangerous and deadly ideologies , is a warning sign for the whole world . After the rocket attacks on Israel from Isfahan , it's time for Freiburg to end its town twinning with Isfahan , and Jewish communities in Germany can play a key role in ending this partnership . & rdquo;Freiburg&rsquo;s mayor and city government and its tiny Jewish community run by the controversial chairwoman , Irina Katz , declined to condemn Isfahan&rsquo;s call to eradicate Israel in April . At a April demonstration held on Al-Quds day in Isfahan , the last Friday of Ramadan , the Imam of Isfahan , Ayatollah Yousef Tabatabainejad , declared , & rdquo;It is our obligation to support the oppressed Muslims who have been oppressed and we hope that , with divine providence in this path of resistance , we will be able to wipe the Zionist regime off the face of the earth . & rdquo;Katz took to the streets last year to protest Prime Minister&rsquo;s Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s hotly debated effort to reform the judicial system . She has not called for the end of the Freiburg-Isfahan partnership.The German state of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg , where Freiburg is located , has enabled Iran&rsquo;s chemical missile weapons program . In 2018 , the Post reported the company Krempel , located in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg , sold technology to Iranian regime businessmen that was later used in the production of chemical rockets that resulted in a Syrian regime gas attack on civilians . The chemical missile attack resulted in 21 injuries , including many children.It is unclear if the Krempel technology was used in Iranian missiles fired at Israel . & nbsp;The Green party governor of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg , Winfried Kretschmann , has permitted a flourishing trade relationship to exist between Iran&rsquo;s regime and German banks and engineering companies in his state . The Post previously & nbsp;reported on Kretschmann&rsquo;s financial support in the amount of $ 32,000 for an antisemitic Palestinian Christian pastor who supports BDS.The Wiesenthal Center&rsquo;s Rabbi Abraham Cooper has urged civil society groups like the German-Israel Friendship Society in Stuttgart ( DIG-Stuttgart ) to call for the end of the partnership between Isfahan and Freiburg.After weeks of mounting pressure on the DIG-Stuttgart , the group sent an email to the Post on Friday calling for the termination of the partnership . When asked if the DIG-Stuttgart will urge Mayor Frank Nopper of Stuttgart , the capital of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg , to delete information for the pro-Hamas group Palestine Stuttgart Committee on the city website , Oliver Vrankovic , the chairman of the DIG-Stuttgart , refused to comment.The NGO Palestine Stuttgart Committee has raised funds for the Israel-designated terrorist organization Samidoun , which has an office in Iran . Germany classified Samidoun a terrorist entity after the October 7 massacre . & nbsp;Susan Kaufmann , a spokeswoman for Stuttgart's mayor , told the Post that & rdquo;The state capital Stuttgart has reinstated the address of the Palestine Committee Stuttgart on the city's homepage in consideration of the legal position represented by the Stuttgart Administrative Court . & rdquo;German legal experts and pro-Israel advocates argue that Nopper is not serious about stopping the financing of Hamas and Samidoun because he could delete all NGO entries on the city&rsquo;s website to ensure there is no financing of Palestinian terrorism.When asked if Nopper would delete all NGO entries on the city&rsquo;s website , Kaufmann refused to comment.When asked if the DIG-Stuttgart will urge the Stuttgart-based bank LBBW to close the account of Palestine Stuttgart Committee , Vrankovic declined to comment . The DIG-Stuttgart and its national organization DIG are financed by the German foreign ministry . It is unclear why DIG-Stuttgart retains a dovish posture toward the financing and support of Hamas and Samidoun by & nbsp;Stuttgart and the state of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg . Stuttgart and the state government reportedly own nearly 50 % of the LBBW bank . & nbsp;The LBBW bank is opposing the trend in Germany to counter alleged financing of pro-Palestinian terrorist organizations , in which banks have closed accounts of pro-Hamas groups . Last month , the Berlin Sparkasse bank suspended the account of the far-left and pro-Hamas group & ldquo;Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Middle East&rdquo ; because of alleged ties with Palestinian terrorists and extremists.In 2019 , after a series of Post investigative reports on the bank account of the pro-BDS group & ldquo;Jewish Voice for a Just Peace in the Middle East , & rdquo ; the German Bank for Social Economy in Cologne & nbsp;closed the organization&rsquo;s account.In December , the Post reported Yesh Atid head MK Yair Lapid demanded German authorities disrupt and end Hamas funding streams in Germany . Lapid told German news organization Die Welt&rsquo;s TV program that & ldquo;there are people in Germany who have bank accounts , there are people who perhaps also personally support Hamas activists . And they are working on transferring money to Hamas . & rdquo;Mayor Horn and the Green and Social Democratic parties in Freiburg&rsquo;s city council refused to answer numerous Post press queries . All of the major parties in the city council ( with the exception of the tiny pro-Israel JUPI Party ) and Mayor Horn have remained wedded to the partnership with Isfahan.In 2021 , the Post broke the story that the University of Freiburg stopped its cooperation agreement with Isfahan University.The city of Freiburg has been embroiled in numerous pro-Iran regime scandals . Freiburg rolled out the red carpet for Mohammad Khatami in 208 , who served as Iran's president from 1997 to 2005 , and praised the late French Holocaust denier Roger Garaudy.Saeed Laylaz , former advisor to President Khatami , recently said that & ldquo;If Israel or the US respond to the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s attacks , the Islamic Republic will test its first nuclear bomb , & ldquo ; according to Iran International.The New York-based Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) wrote in 2016 & ldquo;the Islamic Association of the University of Isfahan has announced that it will hold its own Holocaust cartoon contest . The Islamic Association held a similar contest in 2015 . In announcing this year&rsquo;s contest , the Islamic Association explained that its goal is to demonstrate sympathy with oppressed Palestinians and show hatred towards the Zionist regime and & lsquo;the child killer Israel . & rsquo ; The organizers claim the contest is & lsquo;not anti-Semitic , & rsquo ; but rather an effort to question such a disgraceful and false phenomenon & ndash ; the Holocaust - something which no one in the Western world dares to do . & rdquo ;",german city sticks with isfahan partnership that fired suicide drones at israel
2024-06-07 18:38:43.370,jpost,"Living in temporary accommodation in the desert above the Dead Sea , nine-year-old Emily Hand and her father , Thomas , slowly recover from an ordeal that has upended their lives as the Gaza war rages.Emily , a dual Irish-Israeli citizen , was kidnapped by Hamas militants on Oct . 7 last year during a rampage of killing and destruction on her Kibbutz Be'eri . She spent 50 harrowing days in captivity in Gaza until her release in November.Since her reunification with her father , Dublin-born Thomas Hand , they have been moving from one place of temporary accommodation to another , carrying only a few belongings and the family dog.Hand said his native Ireland had been instrumental in the release of his daughter . But he voiced strong criticism of the Irish government's recognition of a Palestinian state.He feels the step rewards Hamas , the Palestinian Islamist group that kidnapped his daughter after the attack on Israel in which 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 taken to Gaza as hostages . "" I'm ashamed to call myself Irish "" "" All my life I was proud to be Irish and I told people around me that . I'm not so proud anymore . I'm ashamed and embarrassed to call myself Irish , "" said Hand . "" The Irish authorities were part of Emily's release process . They know everything , everything that Hamas did . They saw the footage from the terrorists ' GoPro cameras . So here , this is their reward , recognition of the country . Nice of them , "" Hand added sarcastically.Ireland said its stance is rooted in seeking a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . "" We're praying for it to happen and for all of this to end . All they ( Hamas ) have to do is hand over the hostages , and the war is over , "" said Hand.He tries to provide a sense of normalcy for Emily , and says that , despite one or two triggers , she is on track for a full recovery.Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced from the southern communities near the border with Gaza amid the ongoing war , and also from northern Israel due to ongoing cross-border hostilities between Hezbollah and Israeli forces . & nbsp ;",' ashamed to call myself irish ' : thomas hand on ireland's recognition of palestine
2023-11-05 20:50:13.827,jpost,"The Biden administration is opposed to the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza to neighboring Egypt , US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas when he met with him in Ramallah on Sunday.Blinken & ldquo;made clear that Palestinians must not be forcibly displaced , & rdquo ; State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said after their meeting.They also spoke about the importance of restoring stability to the West Bank and & ldquo;the need to stop extremist violence against Palestinians and hold those accountable responsible , & rdquo ; Miller said.The two met during Blinken&rsquo;s visit to the region close to one month into the start of the Gaza war . He met with Abbas after holding talks with Israeli officials in Tel Aviv and Arab leaders in Jordan over the weekend.In his meetings with Arab leaders , such as King Abdullah in Jordan on Saturday , he attempted to assuage their fears over the possibility of a forced expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza.US President Joe Biden issued the same message to Abdullah when he spoke with the monarch last Tuesday.They & ldquo;agreed that it is critical to ensure that Palestinians are not forcibly displaced outside of Gaza , & rdquo ; the White House said after the call.US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby echoed that sentiment in speaking with reporters last Wednesday.He rejected any reports of a plan to expel Palestinians from Gaza . & ldquo;I want to stress that is not our policy . That is not what we are after . We want to make sure that the people of Gaza , should they want to go back home , can go back home . But if they want to get out in the interim , they should be able to get out . & rdquo;Palestinians flee homes in Gaza to escape IDF bombings , failed rocket launchesSome 1.4 million of the 2.3 million residents of the Gaza Strip have fled their homes in an attempt to escape IDF bombings or explosions from failed Palestinian rocket launches.Hamas claims that close to 10,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war on October 7.Israelis have suggested that Palestinian civilians in Gaza should be temporarily allowed to relocate to Egypt for their safety until the war ends.Palestinians have voiced concern that this would be a second expulsion , akin to what happened to them during Israel&rsquo;s War of Independence in 1948 when invading Arab countries encouraged them to flee while they & ldquo;pushed the Jews into the sea . & rdquo ; Some 750,000 Arabs fled or in some cases were forcibly expelled from their homes during the war , an event that Palestinians refer to as the & ldquo;Nakba&rdquo ; ( catastrophe ) . PA envoy to the UN Riyad Mansour told the Security Council last Monday that & ldquo;Israel wants to depopulate the Gaza Strip completely . . . and throw them [ Gazans ] into the lap of Egypt in the Sinai desert . & rdquo;Kirby last Wednesday stressed that & ldquo;there is no US policy for endorsement for some sort of permanent settlement&rdquo ; of Palestinians outside of Gaza.The war in Gaza was ignited by the infiltration into southern Israel of Hamas terrorists who murdered over 1,400 people and took more than 240 people hostage.Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told a Lebanese news outlet this week that his organization would execute more October 7 attacks , because it does not believe that Israel should exist . & nbsp;Kirby said , & ldquo;This is what is at stake for the Israeli people , that is what is at stake for the people of Gaza , that Hamas is willing to continue this fight and will continue to try and slaughter innocent Israelis . Those are chilling comments and we all ought to take them seriously . & rdquo;Hamas , he said , cannot remain in power after the war , he added.An Israeli diplomatic source told reporters on Sunday that the IDF must retain security control of Gaza after the war . & ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see a situation where Israel will not have supreme security responsibility in Gaza , & rdquo ; the source stated . Work must also be done to change the mindset of Palestinian society there , the source added . & ldquo;It is not enough to restore Gaza . It must be put through a process of de-Nazification , & rdquo ; the source added.The source noted that the problem was not limited to Gaza , but also included the West Bank . & ldquo;This culture [ of wanting to kill Jews ] still exists in the Palestinian Authority , & rdquo ; the source said , warning during the conversation that West Bank settlements were in danger of Hamas attacks.Blinken told Abbas that Washington believes the PA & ldquo;should play a central role in what comes next in Gaza , & rdquo ; said a senior State Department official who briefed reporters traveling with Blinken.The official said the future of Gaza was not the focus of the meeting but that PA officials appeared willing to play a role.Abbas told Blinken that Gaza is & ldquo;an integral part&rdquo ; of the state Palestinians want , according to an account of the meeting from the official Palestinian news agency WAFA , which suggested any PA role in governing Gaza would have to be part of a wider settlement of the decades-old conflict . & ldquo;We will fully assume our responsibilities within the framework of a comprehensive political solution that includes all of the West Bank , including east Jerusalem , and the Gaza Strip , & rdquo ; Abbas was quoted by WAFA as saying.Reuters contributed to this report .",blinken to abbas : us opposes relocation of gaza palestinians to egypt

2022-09-16 09:28:43.980,jpost,"Over the weekend , the IDF scoured the West Bank for the Palestinian terrorist that moderately injured one 18-year-old hesder yeshiva student when he fired at the Carmel settlement in the South Hebron Hills the night before.It was the second significant terror attack in the West Bank involving Israeli civilians in the last two weeks and comes amid a spike in such incidents.Seven Israelis were injured when terrorists fired on a bus in the Jordan Valley.On Thursday , at least one Palestinian shooter fired at the settlement from an open area near Carmel , hitting a pre-army religious seminary for young men called Reuta , also known as a hesder yeshiva.The bullets pierced the door , hitting a student and startling the room&rsquo;s occupants , who had not understood until that moment that they were under attack . ' We didn't realize we were in a shooting incident'The yeshiva&rsquo;s Rabbi Natan Ofner explained to KAN News that he and others were studying in the building when they heard a very loud noise.When one of the room&rsquo;s occupants went out to check what was going on , & ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t see anything . Then we heard another noise . In hindsight , we realized it was gunshots that hit the door of the women&rsquo;s section , & rdquo ; Ofner said.At the time , Ofner said , the group thought something had fallen . He and a student went to investigate and returned because everything seemed fine.Then , they heard three & ldquo;very loud explosions&rdquo ; that sounded very close , followed by a volley of gunfire that penetrated the door near where they were standing . & ldquo;We still didn&rsquo;t realize that we were in a shooting incident [ until ] the student saw he was soaked in blood , then everyone realized what was going on . & rdquo;The students entered a protected space and & ldquo;we called the army , which arrived quickly , & rdquo ; Ofner said.In the meantime , the shooting continued until the army arrived , he added.The student was taken to a hospital , where he underwent surgery to remove the bullet fragments and Ofner said he was expected to recover quickly.Separately . the Jerusalem coordinator for the Religious Zionist Party Elhanan Wolff who was driving in the area said his vehicle was hit by the same gunfire , but that he was unscathed . The shooter was using an automatic rifle , he said.Immediately after the attack , residents of the small Carmel settlement were asked to stay in their homes . Earlier this week Maj .

2024-06-24 06:47:48.187,jpost,"Israeli soccer clubs who will be participating in European competitions this coming season found out over the weekend who they will be facing in their respective qualifying tournaments.Maccabi Tel Aviv , Maccabi Haifa , Maccabi Petah Tikva and Hapoel Beersheba will all look to wind their way through the qualifying rounds in order to punch their tickets to the brand-new league phase of the UEFA Champions League , Europa League and Europa Conference League.The new league phase consists of 36 teams for each competition and teams will be drawn against eight different opponents , with four games being played at home and four away for the Champions League and Europa League , while the Conference League teams will play against six different opponents.At the end of the league , teams 1-8 will automatically qualify for the round-of-16 while teams 9-24 will face each other in a knockout playoff round to advance , while teams 25-36 are eliminated from all competitions.In the knockout phase , all ties are contested both home and away culminating in a one-match final.Maccabi Tel Aviv will participate in Champions League qualifying and is looking to advance to the league phase of the prestigious and lucrative competition for the first time since 2015 , where it played the likes of Chelsea , Dynamo Kyiv and Porto in the group stage ( and lost all six games while scoring one goal ) . The yellow-and-blue will begin qualifying in the second round where it will play the winner of the first-round game between Virtus A.C . 1964 from San Marino and Fotbal Club FCSB of Romania , with the formerly known Steaua București being a heavy favorite to advance and play Maccabi.First match of the second round for MaccabiThe first match of the second round for Maccabi will be away from home July 23 to 24 with the home leg the following week , however due to the ongoing war that game will also take place on the road.Already , 29 teams have qualified for the league phase with seven places being up for grabs through the qualifying competition & ndash ; five being through the champions route and two via the league route.Fotbal Club FCSB was founded in 1947 and plays its games at the National Stadium in Bucharest . FCSB is considered to be the biggest club in Romania and has won the most league championships ( 27 ) and cups ( 24 ) . In 1985/86 , it won the European Championship before it was renamed the Champions League , when it defeated Barcelona on penalties and was also the runner-up to AC Milan in 1988/89.Last season , FCSB won the Romanian championship after an eight-year drought , when it took the league by three points over second place Cluj.Maccabi Haifa will take on a relative newcomer to European soccer in FC Sabah from Azerbaijan in Conference League second round qualifying with the home leg taking place July 25 and the return leg slated for the next week in Baku . Sabah plays at the 13,000 seat Bank Respublika Arena , and the game there will not be an easy task for the Greens.Sabah was established seven years ago and quickly moved into the first division , where it has been one of the best teams in the country . Last season , the club finished in third place and the year before it ended the campaign in second place . That allowed it to compete in Europe for the first time , where it made it to the third round of Conference League qualifying before being eliminated by Partizan Belgrade.Hapoel Beersheba will also play in Conference League qualifying against Bulgarian outfit PFC Cherno More Varna , which finished last season in third place of its domestic league , just one point away from CSKA Sofia and 13 points off of first place Ludogorets.Cherno has captured four league titles over the course of its 111-year history , with the most recent coming way back in 1938 , with its last Cup and Super Cup having been won in 2015 which led to Europa League qualifying the following season.In 2008 to 2009 , the Bulgarian side played against Maccabi Netanya in the UEFA Cup qualifiers and passed the Diamond City squad 3-1 on aggregate in the two games that they played.Maccabi Petah Tikva last played in the group stages of European competition back in the 2005 and 2006 UEFA Cup and the wait to feature in continental play may need to wait yet for another season as it will face Portuguese mainstays FC Braga , which finished in fourth place in domestic league action and plays in the 30,000-seat Municipal Stadium.Daniel Sousa was recently appointed as the club&rsquo;s head coach after having worked for many years under Andr&eacute ; Villas-Boas and worked at Porto , Chelsea , Tottenham and Marseille among others before heading out on his own when he managed Gil Vincente in 2022 and 2023 and Arouca this past season .","mac . ta , mac . haifa , mac . pt , hap . beersheba learn european foes"
2021-02-08 18:02:10.773,jpost,"Hamas says it is confident it will score another victory in the upcoming Palestinian parliamentary election , according to sources close to the Islamist movement . & nbsp ; The Islamist movement says it also has no intention of accepting the conditions of the Middle East Quartet ( US , UN , Russia and EU ) for the recognition of any Palestinian government , the renunciation of violence , the recognition of Israel&rsquo;s right to exist and a commitment to abide by all agreements signed between the Palestinians and Israel . & nbsp ; Hamas&rsquo;s election program will be similar to the one it used to win the hearts and minds of Palestinians during the 2006 parliamentary election . & nbsp ; Then , Hamas candidates ran as part of a list named the & ldquo;Change and Reform Bloc&rdquo ; under the slogan : & ldquo;Islam is the solution . One hand builds , another resists . Yes to reform , yes to change . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Hamas believes its chances of scoring another victory , if and when the parliamentary election takes place , are very good , given the growing schism in Fatah and allegations of financial and administrative corruption in Palestinian Authority institutions , the sources said . & nbsp ; Hamas is also convinced that many Palestinians will vote for its candidates because they identify with the Islamist movement&rsquo;s ideology . & nbsp ; There were two main reasons why Hamas won the last parliamentary election . Firstly , there were divisions among Fatah , many of whose disgruntled members chose to run as independents . Secondly , there was widespread frustration with rampant corruption of Fatah and PA leaders . & nbsp ; Explaining its decision to participate in the 2006 election , the Change and Reform Bloc said in its election program : & ldquo;The Islamic Resistance Movement [ Hamas ] believes its participation in the legislative elections at this time , and in light of the reality in which the Palestinian cause is witnessing , comes within the framework of its comprehensive program for the liberation of Palestine and the return of the Palestinian people to their land and homeland . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; In 1996 , Hamas boycotted the first parliamentary elections because they were held under the umbrella of the Oslo Accords , which it continues to oppose . & nbsp ; In 2006 , however , Hamas changed its mind and decided to participate in the election to the parliament , the Palestinian Legislative Council ( PLC ) . The result was a victory for Hamas , which received 44.45 % of the vote and won 74 of the 132 seats . & nbsp ; Addressing the Palestinian public ahead of that election , the Change and Reform Bloc said it was seeking & ldquo;to build a developed Palestinian civil society and direct the Palestinian political system and its political and reform program to achieve the national rights of the Palestinian people . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Hamas list emphasized that & ldquo;historical Palestine is part of the Arab and Islamic lands , and it is a right of the Palestinian people that does not pass by the statute of limitations . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Palestinian people , the list noted , & ldquo;are still in the stage of national liberation , and they have the right to work to restore their rights and end the occupation by using all means , including armed resistance . Resistance in all its forms is a natural right of the Palestinian people to end the occupation and establish the Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; The Hamas list also promised to make Islamic law & ldquo;the main source of legislation in Palestine and respect public freedoms . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; & ldquo;Palestinian blood is a taboo in Palestinian society , and dialogue is the only acceptable method for resolving internal Palestinian disputes , & rdquo ; it told voters . & nbsp ; Moreover , the Hamas list pledged to halt & ldquo;political arrests&rdquo ; and vowed to & ldquo;protect civil-society institutions . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; But in July 2007 , the group staged a violent coup against the PA and seized control of the Gaza Strip . Dozens of Palestinians were killed during the violence . & nbsp ; Hamas has since arrested thousands of Palestinians , especially those affiliated with its rivals in Fatah , in addition to journalists , political activists , human-rights advocates and civil-society workers . & nbsp ; Hamas&rsquo;s 2006 election campaign also focused on corruption , an issue that has been bothering many Palestinians since the inception of the PA in 1994 . & nbsp ; & ldquo;Public funds are the right of all the Palestinian people and should be used in financing comprehensive Palestinian development in a manner that achieves justice away from abuse , corruption and embezzlement , & rdquo ; Hamas said in its election program . & nbsp ; It promised to combat corruption & ldquo;in all its forms and enhance transparency and accountability . & rdquo ; & nbsp ; Hamas leaders were scheduled to participate in a meeting of several Palestinian factions in Cairo on Monday to discuss preparations for the parliamentary , presidential and Palestinian National Council ( PNC ) elections . & nbsp ; If the factions reach an agreement , the parliamentary election will take place on May 22 , and the presidential election will take place on July 31 . The vote for the PNC , the PLO&rsquo;s legislative body , has been set for the end of August . & nbsp ; Aware that its chances of winning the presidential election are nonexistent , Hamas has its eyes set on the Palestinians&rsquo ; two parliaments : the PLC and the PNC . & nbsp ; The PLC&rsquo;s 132 members represent Palestinians living in the West Bank , Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem . The PNC parliament has nearly 700 members and represents all Palestinians , inside and outside those areas .","palestinian elections : hamas will promise islamic law , change and reform"
2024-04-17 20:53:33.323,jpost,"The Movement for Quality Government in Israel ( MQG ) demanded in a letter on Wednesday a criminal investigation into actions by former justice minister Ayelet Shaked after recordings published by Channel 12 on Tuesday indicated that she agreed to appoint a judge after former Israel Bar Association chair Effi Naveh pressured her to do so for personal benefits.As part of their respective responsibilities , both Naveh and Shaked were members of the Judicial Appointments Committee , which is responsible for appointing all of Israel&rsquo;s judges . Haaretz reporter Chaim Levinson published recordings last month of conversations from 2016 between Nave and the judge in question , Eitan Orenstein , in which Orenstein appeared to agree to a number of Naveh&rsquo;s demands in exchange for an appointment as president of the Tel Aviv District Court . Orenstein eventually received the appointment.In the new recordings that aired on Tuesday , Shaked said in response to Naveh that Orenstein had & ldquo;no chance&rdquo ; of receiving the promotion . However , she commented to Naveh & ldquo;This is the most important thing to you in the world , ah ? & rdquo ; and appeared to agree to Naveh&rsquo;s demand . Naveh is heard explaining in the recordings that his private law firm would benefit if Orenstein is appointed , since Orenstein would then have the power to choose favorable judges to preside over Naveh&rsquo;s cases.MQG said in a statement that accompanied its letter , which it addressed to the Attorney-General , Israel Police Commissioner , and the police&rsquo;s Investigations and Intelligence Division head , that & ldquo;the conversations that were published yesterday are credible evidence for establishing reasonable suspicion that serious offenses were committed in the field of standards in public life by senior officials in the legal world . & rdquo;The MQG added that & ldquo;in view of the goals of the criminal procedure , it is important to complete the investigative procedures efficiently and quickly , in order to establish the truth and carry out the law with all those involved in the case . & rdquo;Shaked said to Channel 12 on Tuesday in response to the report that she had been subject to & ldquo;pressure from different people over the appointment of president of the Tel Aviv District Court&rdquo ; regarding more than one candidate , but that the decision in the end to appoint Orenstein was made based on & ldquo;professional considerations only , & rdquo ; and was supported by then-Supreme Court Chief Justice and Judicial Appointments Committee member Miriam Naor.A history of convictions and accusationsNaveh has a history of problematic conduct . He was convicted and sentenced to a two-month suspended sentence in November for sneaking his partner past customs agents at Ben-Gurion airport in 2018 . He had engaged in the subterfuge because he was in the midst of divorce proceedings at the time.The former Bar president was also accused of promoting judicial candidates in exchange for sexual favors , and resigned over the scandal in 2019 . The case was dropped in 2021 , as the deputy state attorney believed the case would lose in court.Naveh ran again to lead the Israel Bar Association in June 2023 but , supported by Justice Minister Yariv Levin , he lost by a landslide , winning just 19 % of the vote . HIs defeat was seen at the time as a sign of opposition to Levin&rsquo;s judicial reforms.Mike Starr contributed to this report",ngo demands criminal investigation of former justice minister shaked
