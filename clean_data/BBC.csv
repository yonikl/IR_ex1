"" there must be an urgent investigation and accountability , "" he said . "" this must not happen again . "" france , italy and germany have also called for an independent investigation into the aid convoy deaths . french president emmanuel macron said civilians had been "" targeted by israeli soldiers "" . un secretary general antónio guterres wrote on social media : "" i condemn thursday's incident in gaza in which more than 100 people were reportedly killed or injured while seeking life-saving aid . "" "" the desperate civilians in gaza need urgent help , including those in the north where the un has not been able to deliver aid in more than a week .

"" we went to get flour to feed our children . we went to nabulsi street and before the trucks arrived there was gunfire . "" as the trucks entered , we headed towards them , and as we tried to get the first bag of flour out of the truck , they began to fire at us . "" mr rihan said he was carried to the hospital on a cart and that his x-rays have been delayed due to a lack of electricity . khaled al-tarawish was also wounded and said his surgery has also been postponed due to a lack of fuel in al-awada hospital . "" i went to nabulsi street to get a bag of flour , "" he said . "" because of the crowd i ran under the car , i went to the awda hospital where they told me that i needed to have an operation but because there was no diesel fuel , they told me the operation would be carried out three days later . "" all i want is to provide the hospital with diesel fuel so that i can undergo the operation and get my treatment . "" the convoy of 30 lorries carrying egyptian aid was making its way north along what the israel defense forces ( idf ) described as a "" humanitarian corridor "" which it said its forces were securing . idf chief spokesman , rear adm daniel hagari , said civilians surrounded the convoy and people began climbing on the lorries . "" some began violently pushing and even trampling other gazans to death , looting the humanitarian supplies , "" he said . "" the unfortunate incident resulted in dozens of gazans killed and injured . "" israeli tanks , he said , "" cautiously tried to disperse the mob with a few warning shots "" but pulled back "" when the hundreds became thousands and things got out of hand "" . another idf spokesman , lt col peter lerner , said some civilians approached a checkpoint which was about 70 metres ( 230 feet ) away and ignored warning shots fired by the soldiers there . he said the soldiers , fearing that some of the civilians posed a threat , then opened fire on those approaching in what he described as a "" limited response . "" hamas rejected the idf's account , citing "" undeniable "" evidence of "" direct firing at citizens , including headshots aimed at immediate killing "" . the incident came hours before gaza's health ministry announced that more than 30,000 people , including 21,000 children and women , had been killed in gaza since the start of the current conflict on 7 october . some 7,000 were missing and 70,450 were injured , it said . mr gutteres added : "" i am appalled by the tragic human toll of the conflict in gaza - more than 30,000 people reportedly killed and over 70,000 injured . "" i reiterate my call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the unconditional release of all hostages .

"" it comes amid tense ceasefire negotiations and as pressure builds on mr biden to help curtail the conflict . a proposed deal would see a 40-day pause in all military operations from the start of ramadan as well as an increased flow of aid into gaza , a source close to the talks told reuters news agency . it would also reportedly include an agreement for the release of palestinian prisoners in exchange for israeli hostages at a ratio of 10 to one . the exact start of ramadan is marked by the first sighting of the crescent moon , so can vary from place to place . calls for action to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in gaza intensified on thursday after more than 100 people were killed as crowds rushed around aid lorries delivering food . hamas , which governs gaza , accused israel of firing at civilians , but israel said most had died in a stampede after it fired warning shots . following the incident , president biden announced plans to airdrop aid into gaza , saying : "" innocent people got caught in a terrible war , unable to feed their families . and you saw the response when they tried to get aid .

2024-03-01T20:46:03.000Z,BBC,"seven hostages being held in the gaza strip have died , hamas said on friday . the group blamed the deaths on israeli bombardment and said a "" number "" of its fighters were also killed . it said the number of hostages killed might now exceed 70 . the bbc has not been able to independently verify this . it was not immediately clear if these deaths were among the 31 hostages israel believes have already died . there has been no comment yet from israel , and hamas did not provide substantiating evidence . hamas took 253 hostages when gunmen launched an attack on southern israel on 7 october , and killed about 1,200 people . israel responded by launching a large-scale air and ground campaign to destroy hamas . more than 30,000 palestinians have been killed in gaza as a result , the hamas-run health ministry says , and the un is warning of a looming famine in the north of the country . in november , hamas released 105 hostages as part of a temporary ceasefire deal with israel , in exchange for israel freeing 240 palestinian prisoners . israel says more than 100 hostages are still being held inside gaza . it is not known when the reported deaths of the hostages took place . in a statement released on the telegram account of the qassam brigades - hamas ' armed wing - spokesman abu obeida appeared to suggest that the group was still interested in a deal with israel to release the hostages in return for prisoners held by israel . "" we affirm that the price we will take in exchange for five or 10 living prisoners is the same price we would have taken in exchange for all the prisoners if the enemy's bombing operations had not killed them , "" the spokesman said . the release of hostages is one of the central points in ceasefire talks in qatar which have been going on for months . the discussions are trying to secure a short-term ceasefire , during which hostages would gradually be released . female civilians and soldiers would be freed first . in return , palestinian prisoners , some of them convicted of serious terrorist offences , would be released from israeli jails . israeli soldiers might move away from some of gaza's most populated areas , and some of the 1.8 million palestinians displaced by the fighting since october might be able to return to homes in the north . however , there are fears that the announcement of the hostages ' deaths , coupled with the deaths of at least 112 people during a gaza aid delivery on thursday , could hamper these talks . hamas accused israel of firing at civilians , but israel said most died in a crush after it fired warning shots . after thursday's deaths , hamas warned that talks in qatar to try and secure a new ceasefire alongside the release of israeli hostages it is holding could now be jeopardised . earlier this week , us president joe biden had said he hoped a temporary ceasefire could be agreed by early next week but this is looking increasingly unlikely . on friday , mr biden announced that "" in the coming days "" the us would take part in air drops of food into gaza . "" innocent people got caught in a terrible war , unable to feed their families . and you saw the response when they tried to get aid , "" he said . "" we need to do more and the united states will do more .

2024-03-02T15:23:30.000Z,BBC,"after the events at al-rashid street in gaza , in which more than 100 people were reported killed after a rush on an aid convoy , the international community is under pressure to tackle the growing crisis of hunger in the territory , as fergal keane reports from jerusalem . they die in all kinds of places and ways . broken under the rubble of their homes , blasted by explosives , punctured by high velocity bullets , cut open by flying shards of metal . and now - as the war enters its fifth month - death from hunger has come to haunt gaza . it is essential to know the when , what and how of the tragedy at al-rashid street . although the precise facts require an independent investigation of a kind not likely in gaza under current conditions , that should not distract from trying to answer why people risked their lives to gather in the pre-dawn darkness in the middle of a war zone . the refugees were there because they were desperate to feed their families . they died by bullets and trampling - we do not yet know in what proportion - simply because they wanted to live . that is a cruel irony . eighty-five per cent of the population of gaza is now displaced . the war has dismantled all normal economic activity and food supplies . water and electricity supplies have been disrupted . hospitals struggle without adequate medicine or power . for the last week the un - citing concerns over security - has said it is unable to deliver aid to northern gaza . these are fundamental facts to bear in mind when trying to understand the tragedy . from the outset the international community - expressed in public statements - has regarded israel as having the primary responsibility for ensuring aid can be delivered safely . but , after months of war there is no sign of what the un calls "" an enabling environment "" in which large volumes of aid can be delivered to those who need it . it is not as if there has been absence of evidence of a mounting humanitarian crisis . witness the statements made by the un over several months . "" we are already seeing a cascading collapse in water , sewage , and sanitation services , telecoms , food shortages , and healthcare , "" the un's human rights office reported on 15 november . on 2 december , the office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs reported : "" un humanitarians on monday said that aid teams had only ' extremely limited ' movement and access to the north was "" now entirely blocked . "" twelve days later the un security council adopted resolution 2720 calling on "" the parties to the conflict to allow , facilitate and enable the immediate , safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to palestinian civilians throughout that territory . "" on 26 january , the international court of justice ( icj ) required israel "" take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance . "" by 9 february , director of the un relief and welfare agency ( unrwa ) phillipe lazzarini was accusing israel of blocking food for 1.1 million palestinians in gaza . according to the un , 500 lorries of aid are required each day . the daily average has been 90 . the aid falling by parachute from the skies in recent days is welcomed on the ground , but it is also a symbol of the failure of the aid effort . there are roads leading into gaza from israel and egypt along which lorries carrying huge amounts of aid could travel - if those roads were safe . the continuing war , and the chaotic conditions it has spawned , mean many lorry drivers will not risk their lives . civilians looting aid , and criminal gangs stealing aid to sell , are part of what one un official termed the "" mogadishu-like "" conditions that may be developing - a reference to the chaos that enveloped the somali capital during the civil conflict of the early 1990s . the hamas-run police force in gaza is unwilling to escort aid convoys because its members reportedly fear being shot by the israelis . as for hamas's leaders , having provoked this war they have vanished and are now fighting to survive in the tunnels and ruins of gaza . israel says it is facilitating aid delivery and that , for example , there were three escorted deliveries on the nights prior to the tragedy at al-rashid street . it has blamed the un saying aid is stacked up inside the northern border and the un hasn't "" turned up "" to distribute the supplies . it is also deeply mistrustful of unrwa - accusing the agency of being infiltrated by hamas . in the wake of the allegations unrwa sacked 12 employees accused of either being involved in the 7 october attacks in israel or helping in the detention of hostages . israel's defence minister yoav gallant said the idf would no longer deal with the agency . "" unrwa has lost legitimacy , "" he said , "" and can no longer function as a un body . "" at the beginning of the conflict , days after hamas killed more than 1,200 people in israel and kidnapped 250 others , mr gallant ordered a complete blockade of the gaza strip . "" there will be no electricity , no food , no fuel , everything is closed … we are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly , "" he said . that position changed under us pressure with president joe biden announcing a deal on 19 october under which israel and egypt allowed aid into gaza . some supplies began to flow but there were still reports of growing hunger . there were repeated entreaties from western politicians including uk foreign secretary lord cameron . on 9 january , he said he was worried israel had "" taken action that might be in breach of international law "" - adding he wanted israel to restore water supplies to gaza . a month later - on 12 february - he told the uk's house of lords that israel had to make sure food , water and shelter were available to people in gaza "" because if they don't do that , that would be a breach of international humanitarian law "" . in the wake of al-rashid street he called for an urgent investigation . "" this must not happen again , "" he said . but the evidence from many civilians in gaza is they live in constant fear of violent death and - increasingly - starvation . in time the world will ask itself why the un security council , comprising the most powerful nations on earth , did not ensure the delivery of life-saving aid to hundreds of thousands of desperate people in gaza . this after nearly eight decades of un humanitarian operations around the world . there is no shortage of experience or resources . addressing the security council a week before al-rashid street incident , secretary general of aid organisation medecins sans frontieres christopher lockyear spoke of a situation where "" the laws and the principles we collectively depend on to enable humanitarian assistance are now eroded to the point of becoming meaningless … the humanitarian response in gaza today is an illusion . "" it is still too early to speak of the tragic events of 29 february as a turning point . but , the deaths of so many in such terrible circumstances have added to the growing pressure for a ceasefire deal that would allow food to reach the hungry . the coming days will tell if those hopes can be realised .",pro-palestinian supporters disrupt speech by david lammy

"" it's hard that he chose these actions , it's hard to comprehend even from people who sympathise with a ceasefire and the safety of palestinian people and civilians , "" mr escamilla , 25 , said . at least 200 people attended the vigil , including many local palestinians . one by one , mr bushnell's friends took to the microphone to remember and mourn him . before sunday , mr escamila said he knew mr bushnell as "" normal , quiet , friendly , quirky guy , "" who drank root beer , embraced leftist politics , and volunteered with groups who helped people experiencing homelessness . the airman had a cat named sugar and liked the lord of the rings , he said . moon , a friend of mr bushnell's who asked to be identified only by his first name , met him through volunteer work and described him as "" incredibly strong willed "" . the video of his final moments , he said , "" was very tough to see . "" sara masoud , a 32-year-old palestinian organiser who attended the vigil , said learning the news of his death "" was really devastating . "" but the shocking act has prompted discussion among activists who feel "" a sense of relatability to the futility that drove his action "" , she said . mr bushnell had described himself as an anarchist , once writing that he "" believed in the abolition of all hierarchal power structures "" through legal means . while based in san antonio with the air force , he was also active in number of community and mutual aid groups and gravitated especially towards helping the homeless , his friends said . in initial volunteer outings , delivering supplies like first aid and clothing , mr bushnell was "" a little shy "" , mr escamilla recalled , but said he soon learned to engage closely with the people he helped . mr escamilla believed mr bushnell felt a tension between his military service and his political beliefs . he was still in the military when the israel-gaza war erupted in october last year . some 1,200 people were killed after hamas gunmen attacked communities in southern israel . they took around 250 hostages back into the gaza strip , with many still alive and being held there . about 1.8 million palestinians have been displaced since israel launched retaliatory military action , which it says is aimed at destroying hamas . while mr bushnell had strong pro-palestinian views and engaged with local activist groups , no-one expected that he would end his life in a protest against the war in gaza . aaron bushnell grew up in orleans , massachusetts , in a tightly cloistered religious community known as the community of jesus , according to his friends . a childhood friend , ashley schuman , told the new york times he had told her he left the community in 2019 . mr escamilla said that mr bushnell was no longer involved in the community of jesus and had distanced himself from his family . some former members of the community of jesus alleged psychological abuse in a 2021 abc news investigation . mr bushnell's parents , the community of jesus , and a former employer in the community declined to comment to the bbc . in his youth , mr bushnell belonged to a competitive performance group called spirit winter percussion . a group photo from six years ago on his facebook page shows the young performers wearing colourful uniforms and large grins . "" back then he didn't really talk about much besides sports , music , etc , "" brian spencer , who was in the percussion group with mr bushnell , told the bbc . "" but he was a good dude and would always lend a helping hand when needed . "" mr bushnell entered active service on 5 may , 2020 , according the air force . his most recent role was in cyber defence operations . friends say he left san antonio late last year , and he was living in ohio before his death . on his linkedin page , mr bushnell wrote he was seeking opportunities in the us military's skillbridge program , which allows military personnel to transition into civilian jobs after their service ends . he was still in the air force at the time of his death . "" we extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of senior airman bushnell , "" us air force col . celina noyes said in a statement . at friday's vigil , there was an emphasis on remembering the airman as his friends knew him and the causes he believed in , rather than how the world had come to learn his name . before she began her speech on friday , a woman who volunteered with mr bushnell told the crowd : "" you're going to hear a lot of sad things . but you're also going to hear a lot of really good things . "" because this final , fiery moment was not the sum of his life . """,europa conference league : gent and maccabi haifa ordered to play behind closed doors - bbc sport
2024-03-03T00:02:57.000Z,BBC,"as deadly israeli bombardments and acute food shortages continue , and a threatened israeli military operation in southern gaza looms , more and more palestinians are seeking a way out - if they can find the money for it . this uncertain exit requires people to pay thousands of dollars and navigate scammers and misinformation to get their names onto a list of people approved to leave via the rafah crossing to egypt . the crossing is closed to the vast majority of people under an egyptian-israeli blockade against hamas . only some foreign passport holders and their dependents have been able to leave , as well as some seriously wounded and sick people and those accompanying them . however , a parallel system exists whereby gazans pay egyptian brokers to get on a list of people who can leave . depending on who you talk to , prices range from $ 6,000 ( £ 4,800 ) per person to over $ 12,000 - exorbitant sums for most of gaza's population . yet increasing numbers of people are trying to raise the money to flee , with the help of friends and family in the us and europe . among them are the hammads , currently displaced along with more than a million others in rafah next to the egyptian border . their 15-year-old son ibrahim has down's syndrome . for him , the israeli bombardment is particularly traumatic . video posted by the family shows him shaking in distress after each thunderous boom from nearby airstrikes . his father abed alqader says they have had to resuscitate him three times after he stopped breathing due to severe panic attacks . he says ibrahim has been begging for the family to leave , saying "" please father , i cannot continue "" . "" for the last five months , all you hear are sounds of bombs , heavy bombing , "" mr hammad added . "" you just sit home and pray you will not be next . "" their online fundraising page , like most , is being managed outside gaza , in their case by another son amjad , who lives in europe . it is one fundraiser among thousands , appealing for donors to assist gazans to "" survive "" , "" evacuate "" and "" escape genocide "" . some campaigns have been successful , raising over $ 100,000 . however , the bbc spoke to several of these account holders who , even after achieving their fundraising goals , said their desperate attempts to help loved ones were mired in chaos and confusion . in the words of one fundraiser , a new jersey woman who asked to remain anonymous to avoid risking the chance of hindering her cousin's way out : "" every day is a toss-up . "" the first challenge is determining the cost to leave . fundraising account holders who spoke to the bbc said the most common price was $ 6,000 per person , allowing people to leave within 72 hours . some people fundraise toward the goal of $ 12,000 per person , the price said to get an exit within 24 hours . once enough money is raised , the next challenge becomes getting tens of thousands of dollars into gaza . there are few wire services like western union left in the devastated territory , and the line to enter is days-long . some people have used cryptocurrency exchanges . others have relied on paypal accounts registered elsewhere , as the firm doesn't provide services to people in gaza or the occupied west bank . most people , however , wire the money to someone outside of gaza - a relative or friend in europe - who then withdraws the cash , and travels to egypt to wait in a separate days-long line at the offices of hala travel in cairo , an agency that facilitates travel between egypt and gaza . footage from outside the hala offices shows crowds thronging the street . hala has not responded to requests for comment from the bbc . however , the bbc has obtained a copy of a receipt from hala travel dated 13 february for $ 6,000 . the person's name on that receipt also appears with four others on a separate ticket indicating they have been cleared for entry into egypt . visas and onward travel to cairo are included . the final step is to check for approval online . places like the gaza ministry of foreign affairs facebook account publish daily lists of up to 250 approved names . all have paid thousands to get out , according to the person who provided the receipt , who asked to remain anonymous . people whose names appear on the official list must leave the same day . however , due to spotty wifi service and rolling blackouts , some people miss their window to exit and have to repeat the entire process , including paying again , this person says . the man who provided the hala receipt told the bbc that the names of those on the official list to enter egypt only appear after they've been vetted by egyptian intelligence . "" is this new ? no . it's not really new , but the price before the war was $ 600 . now it's 10 times higher , "" he says . "" gaza is not only under bombardment , but people are profiting from their suffering . "" hamas , the palestinian group which was governing gaza and launched the attack targeting civilians in southern israel that triggered the current war , has also accused "" companies , individuals and people with influence "" of exploiting gazans by "" making them pay exorbitant amounts to coordinate their travel "" . egypt's foreign minister sameh shoukry has told sky news that his country is investigating . we will take whatever measures that we need so as to restrict it and eliminate it immediately , "" he said , without giving further details . in january , egypt's state information service head diaa rashwan "" categorically denied the allegations related to the collection of additional fees from travellers from gaza , as well as claims that an unofficial entity collected fees for the passage to egyptian lands "" . egypt was trying to help gaza's palestinians , he added , and did not want to impose extra burdens on them . much of the crowdfunding is being led by friends and relatives who live abroad and have looked on helplessly as israeli bombardment kills whole families and reduces neighbourhoods to rubble . "" it's heartbreaking to watch , "" says shahd , a woman in the us state of virginia who asked only to go by her first name . she helped organise a campaign for her friends , two brothers , whom she met on tiktok in 2021 . her own relatives in gaza were killed in october , she says . shahd felt compelled to aid her friends after witnessing their narrow escapes from death - on one occasion being hit by flying masonry as a nearby building exploded . since then , they have been struggling to survive amid gaza's deepening humanitarian crisis and , they say , navigating the gang rule that has replaced social cohesion . "" there's moments where [ the brothers ] are like , ' we really can't do this anymore . it might be better if we were killed ' , "" shahd says . "" they're basically like family to me at this point . if anything were to happen to them , i'd probably lose it . "" the fundraising page for shahd's friends and some of their family has reached over $ 105,000 . but sending it to them has been difficult . their fundraising account was frozen for several days in february , blocking her from transferring the money . and the brothers ' paypal accounts were locked for weeks without explanation . multiple users raising money to aid people in gaza have complained about having their accounts frozen . "" people are literally trying to escape death , "" one new jersey woman told the bbc . "" it's just mind-blowing that every single corner we turn there's a new obstacle . "" having raised $ 36,000 , she says she missed a window to get her cousin and his family on the list while the company froze her account for several days in early february and asked for more information . she said the request , the first she's had in a decade of using the platform , felt "" discriminatory "" . nearly every person told the bbc they had the same experiences with delays , and multiple said they had to resort to legal threats before getting a response . gofundme , one of the platforms people are using to raise money , told the bbc its priority was "" protecting the generosity of donors "" . "" gofundme has already helped deliver tens of millions of dollars to individuals and organizations supporting those in both israel and gaza , and we will continue to do so as quickly , securely , and safely as possible , "" spokesman jalen drummond said . "" any suggestion of discrimination is wholly without merit , baseless , and contrary to the values that guide our platform . "" jordan , from brooklyn , new york , has hit his fundraising target of $ 50,000 and plans to wire it directly to his friend's bank in gaza . his friend's family must leave to access life-saving medicine . more than 1.5 million people are in rafah , most of whom have fled there to escape the fighting , but only a slim minority have connections to people abroad who can help , a reality jordan described as "" really dark "" . ahmad , who lives in gaza but has a friend in canada fundraising for him , says he has to leave because of chronic knee inflammation , the medication for which is no longer available in gaza . "" me and anyone in gaza may die in any second , "" he said from the rooftop of a building in rafah , israeli drones buzzing in the background . earlier that day , on 12 february , he sent the bbc a picture of two girls who he said died overnight in a nearby air strike . "" i'm pretty much alive , "" he said in the same whatsapp message . "" very depressed bro . "" the 24-year-old has been fundraising for weeks but still hasn't found a way out of gaza . first , his fundraising account was frozen . as a result , he had to borrow thousands of dollars from his parents - who are resigned to staying in the war-zone - to pay some middlemen whom he trusted to facilitate getting him on the exit list . his plan failed after giving them $ 5,000 , and he had to fork out another $ 3,000 to resolve the issue . he promised his parents he would pay them back once he got to cairo and could access the money raised by crowdfunding . ahmad is still waiting . on thursday , reached by text message , he said he was in deep pain and feeling very anxious . but he felt hopeful he was on the verge of finally getting out of gaza . it's happening , he said , "" anytime soon "" .","' dad , please don't go out ' : the gazans killed as israel freed hostages"
2024-03-03T01:25:02.000Z,BBC,"the divisions playing out in demonstrations on british streets are also playing out in all our lives - and increasingly in the cultural world too . with antisemitism and islamophobia rising , words and actions really matter , but from the pavements to the playgrounds to the playhouses , the israel-gaza conflict is polarising opinion - and protests have spilled into the cultural world , with some inevitable backlash . there have been high-profile examples of cultural figures venturing into the political arena and taking a stance on what's unfolding . charlotte church sang the controversial pro-palestinian chant "" from the river to the sea "" at a concert . ( she denied she was antisemitic ) . the comedian paul currie pulled out a palestinian flag after his show ended at london's soho theatre and told jewish audience members who didn't stand up to "" get out "" . ( the theatre apologised and said it wouldn't be inviting currie back ) . and belfast rappers kneecap recently appeared on the late late show in ireland wearing pro-palestinian outfits . ( they apparently flouted rules set by the broadcaster ) . how is what's happening in the middle east - and the tensions being driven here by war and violence there - impacting the uk's arts and entertainment sphere ? what role does culture have to heal political divides - or foment them ? they're questions i wanted to explore with figures working in that world , to understand where culture fits at a time that emotions are running understandably high . artists speaking up for causes they believe in isn't new . dame vanessa redgrave is almost as renowned for her political views as her acting talents . it's hardly surprising there are people who want to protest about what's happening in gaza . the cultural world contains a lot of left-leaning voices . we've also seen ( so far resisted ) calls for israel to be banned from having a pavilion at the venice biennale and from competing in the eurovision song contest . dame helen mirren and boy george were amongst the artists to sign an open letter in favour of israel taking part in what they called "" unifying events such as singing competitions "" . they argued the contest is a crucial way "" to help bridge our cultural divides and unite people of all backgrounds "" . talking more broadly , the theatre director iqbal khan , associate director at the birmingham rep , says "" the nuance in these issues is being destroyed "" . he calls the polarisation across all forms of public life "" really concerning "" , describing "" a constant requirement to attach yourself to metaphorical flags and tribes of opinion which don't represent the truth of things . "" david baddiel raised the issue of tribalism on the bbc's today programme last week . the comedian , writer and broadcaster said "" within the space i come from - culture , showbusiness , artists , whatever - it feels there is a lot of support for palestinians and it may feel that the jewish voice isn't able to be heard and cowers a bit at the moment "" . he added that baroness warsi , the former conservative deputy chairwoman and his co-host on a new podcast , had told him muslims feel similarly excluded and silenced in the world of politics and government . many would point to lee anderson's comments about "" islamists "" controlling the london mayor as evidence of that . the actress and writer tracy-ann oberman told me that "" for those of us that have lived with israeli and with middle eastern politics for a very long time , who've worked in advocacy between palestinians and israelis and who really understand the geopolitics of the region , we look at people who seem to have suddenly been educated at the university of tiktok to understand the situation - which is of course far too complex to be broken down in a 60-second video "" . she adds that "" we're in shock because of what they're allowing themselves to say and to be part of "" . each night , more horror unfolds in gaza , with grim milestones passed and devastating images beamed into our homes . the conflict was sparked by horrific acts of murder and rape carried out in israel by hamas on 7 october , and the ongoing trauma of the hostages held in gaza . the actor khalid abdalla , who plays dodi fayed in the crown , says "" what is very hard is to find a voice which can speak in a way that honours the fact that there is grief and immense legacies on both sides "" . but with no political solution , no ceasefire , and "" this scale of slaughter , what's left for people other than to protest ? and if they have a platform culturally , to use it "" . it's "" very charged territory "" but there is "" a moral imperative to take a stand "" . the tensions in the middle east can have real world consequences in the uk , not just in racist attacks on the streets . tracy-ann oberman's timely reimagining of shakespeare's the merchant of venice is her attempt to "" reclaim "" a difficult play full of antisemitic tropes . she wanted people to "" see on stage what anti-jewish hatred looks like "" . she is a vocal antisemitism campaigner - often "" the lone voice in a room with so-called progressive creatives "" she says . she told me she now has personal security as well as security guards who patrol the theatre as she performs her play the merchant of venice 1936 . "" you've got a jewish actress who has to have security in the west end because of speaking out about the rapes on 7 october and the industry has not risen up and said ' that's wrong ' . "" "" there should be more people who are saying ' this is unacceptable ' . they would find it unacceptable if this was happening to any other minority "" . "" the country should take this very seriously . as history has proven , what starts with the jews doesn't end with the jews "" . clearly , a line is breached if - in these inflamed times - people feel unsafe . khan says "" the right of an artist to show solidarity with people who are suffering should be absolutely honoured . the minute though somebody's safety is threatened , that's different "" . he uses what happened at the soho theatre comedy show as an example of that . "" everybody in that cultural space should feel safe . and i'm not sure in the soho instance that happened "" . ( soho theatre is still investigating what happened but said while it robustly supported the right of artists to express a wide range of views in their shows , "" intimidation of audience members , acts of antisemitism or any other forms of racism will not be tolerated "" . ) khan says while "" vigorous debate "" is useful , people "" need to talk without encroaching on another's safety or inciting others to violence "" . he believes there is "" enormous support culturally for those who oppose antisemitism "" . there is also "" massive disgust at what is going on in gaza at the moment , with obviously the understanding that the atrocity that began all of this was the particular set of events on 7 october "" . "" the response feels appalling to a lot of people … that's the thing that's motivating those voices . "" i was horrified at what happened on 7 october . but the continuing response and the amount , i would describe it as a genocide . "" the cultural space being used as a vehicle for activism isn't new . art never operates in a vacuum . think back to 1985 when spitting image broadcast a satirical song , released for sale the following year , called "" i've never met a nice south african "" . it was an attack on that country's apartheid regime and was comedic and pretty uncontroversial . fast forward to 2022 and the baftas took place soon after russia's full-scale invasion of ukraine . stars of the film world including benedict cumberbatch turned up wearing blue and yellow badges in support , and the ukraine flag was projected onto the side of the royal albert hall . then , last summer , liverpool hosted eurovision on behalf of ukraine - in a sun-filled , joyful coming together of cultures . but these geopolitical issues are viewed as binary , for the vast majority in the uk anyway . apartheid was wrong and the invasion of ukraine is unjust - that's the prevailing western narrative , and nobody is taking to the streets or our tv screens to say otherwise . those artists picked a side and were lauded for it . the israel-gaza war is also binary for many , with more than 30,000 killed in gaza and about 1,200 killed in israel . but perhaps that leaves no room for nuance or an understanding that jews in britain aren't representatives of the israeli state , just as british muslims don't speak for hamas - and that there is genuine fear in our minority communities as tensions rise . oberman says "" a lot of people don't seem to understand you can both be heartbroken at the situation in gaza and be appalled at the rise in antisemitism in the uk - the two are not mutually exclusive "" . so where does all this leave that hard won right to freedom of expression ? she argues "" it's sacrosanct but it doesn't seem to be working for the jewish community at the moment "" . abdalla says "" either we believe in freedom of expression or we don't … artists and workers in culture generally have a responsibility to find ways to express whatever is culturally important to their age "" . he believes the cultural arena "" has to be a safe space for difficult conversations . the failure in public discourse has fed this crisis and we have a duty to confront that .

2024-03-04T13:46:21.000Z,BBC,"hopes had been high over the past week following talks in paris that there could be a new gaza ceasefire deal in place for the start of the islamic holy month of ramadan next week . however , while hamas has now sent a delegation to cairo for further negotiations with egyptian and qatari mediators , israel has not . this looks like a serious new block . israeli officials - quoted in local media - demand clear answers from hamas on key issues as well as a list of the surviving israeli hostages who could be released with an agreement . meanwhile , a senior hamas official , dr basem naim , told the bbc on sunday that "" practically , it is impossible to know who is still alive "" because of continuing israeli bombing . "" they are in different areas with different groups . we have asked for a ceasefire to collect that data , "" he added . dr naim went on to say that such "" valuable information "" about the hostages could not be given "" for free "" . he , and other senior hamas figures , have also been continuing to demand a full ceasefire and withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza , rather than a temporary truce . the us and regional players with leverage will now be putting pressure on both israel and hamas trying to shore up recent progress on the potential deal . this would reportedly see some 40 israeli hostages released in exchange for about 10 times as many palestinian prisoners being freed from israeli jails . more than 130 hostages are still believed to be held by hamas . israeli officials have said that at least 30 of them are dead . over the course of a proposed 40-day truce , there would be a surge in desperately needed aid entering into gaza . without a deal , there is a higher threat of a further spread of tensions during ramadan , which this year is due to begin on 10 or 11 march , depending on the lunar calendar . israel is expected to impose restrictions on access for palestinians to the holiest muslim site in occupied east jerusalem , the al-aqsa mosque compound , citing its security concerns . the site - which is also the holiest place in judaism , known as temple mount - has often been a flashpoint for violence in the decades-old israel-palestinian conflict . hamas is well aware of international fears about a new conflagration and has previously used al-aqsa to raise the stakes . last week , in a televised address , the leader of the islamist group , ismail haniyeh , claimed hamas was showing flexibility in negotiations , but also called on palestinians in the occupied west bank and jerusalem to march to the mosque to pray on the first day of ramadan . international pressure for a ceasefire deal has ratcheted up with the dire humanitarian conditions in gaza where , according to the un , hundreds of thousands of people are facing famine following nearly six months of war . "" given the immense scale of suffering , there must be an immediate ceasefire for at least the next six weeks , which is what is currently on the table , "" the us vice-president kamala harris told an event in alabama . "" this will get the hostages out and get a significant amount of aid in . "" "" people in gaza are starving . the conditions are inhumane and our common humanity compels us to act , "" ms harris went on . her comments were some of the strongest language used yet to describe the situation by a senior us government official and reflect the growing frustration within washington - the closest ally of israel - about developments in the war . increasingly what is happening on the ground in gaza is hurting president biden's presidential re-election campaign . in israel , there is also intense domestic pressure on the war cabinet to agree a new deal from the families of the hostages . thousands of israelis joined them for the last leg of a four-day solidarity march , which began close to the gaza border at one of the sites that was a focus of the deadly 7 october hamas attacks , and ended in jerusalem on saturday night . they held up israeli flags and posters of the hostages . speaking at the rally , sharon sharabi whose brother , eli , is still believed to be held in hamas captivity , said : "" we've lost four members of our family , the sharabi family - my family , your family . we do not intend - listen carefully , leaders of israel - we do not intend to bring a fifth coffin here .

"" suddenly , when we were looking up into the sky , we saw aid parachutes . so we remained in the place [ where we were ] until the aid landed about 500 metres away from us . there were many people , but the aid was little , and so we could not get anything . "" mr mokbel said not enough aid was dropped to meet the basic needs of the large number of people in the area . "" thousands of citizens saw the aid falling on them . . . and when hundreds or thousands wait in such areas , only around 10 to 20 people get things , while the others go back with nothing . unfortunately , this method of dropping through air is not the most suitable way to transport aid to the north district of gaza , "" he added . "" gaza needs a land and water pathway to deliver the aid instead of [ doing it in ] such a manner , which doesn't meet the needs of all citizens . "" initially employed during world war two to supply isolated troops on the ground , airdrops have evolved into a valuable tool for delivering humanitarian aid , with the un first using them in 1973 . however , they are considered a "" last resort "" , only to be used "" when more effective options fail "" , as the wfp said in a 2021 report . south sudan is the last place where the wfp carried out airdrops . "" airdrops are expensive , haphazard and usually lead to the wrong people getting the aid , "" jan egeland , the secretary general of the norwegian refugee council and a former un aid chief , told the bbc after returning from a recent three-day visit to gaza . airdrops are seven times more expensive compared to ground-delivered aid due to costs related to aircraft , fuel and personnel , says the wfp . in addition to that , only relatively small quantities can be delivered with each flight , in comparison to what a convoy of lorries can bring in , and significant ground co-ordination is required within the delivery zone , says the wfp . the international committee of the red cross also stresses the importance of controlling distribution to prevent people from risking their lives by consuming inappropriate or unsafe items . "" delivering sudden and unsupervised types of food to people who are malnourished or even starving can pose serious risks to life . these risks need to be weighed against delivering nothing by air , or the delay a ground distribution may incur , "" the organisation warned in a 2016 report published when aid was being airdropped into syria during the country's civil war . airdrops can be carried out from different altitudes , ranging from about 300m to 5,600m ( 985-18,370ft ) in conflict zones , and so ensuring robust packaging is crucial to make sure parcels can endure impact with the ground , the wfp adds . according to the agency , drop zones should ideally be large , open areas no smaller than a football field , which is why deliveries have often been aimed at gaza's coastline . however , this has sometimes resulted in aid falling into the sea or being carried by the wind into israel , according to local accounts . gaza resident samir abo sabha told bbc arabic's gaza lifeline radio that he believed the us should do more and put pressure on its ally israel for a ceasefire . "" as a citizen of gaza , this stuff is of no use , "" he said . "" what we want [ is ] america to pressure israel into a ceasefire and to stop giving israel weapons and missiles . "" some aid workers have echoed this sentiment . last week , scott paul of oxfam america wrote on x , formerly twitter : "" instead of indiscriminate airdrops in gaza , the us should cut the flow of weapons to israel that are used in indiscriminate attacks , push for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages , and insist that israel uphold its duty to provide humanitarian aid , access , and other basic services .

"" and we will not have become an authoritarian state if london is no longer permitted to be turned into a no-go zone for jews every weekend . "" "" all these things and more have become normalised in the uk , "" mr simcox added . a spokeswoman for mr sunak said that mr simcox was "" referring to intimidation by a minority at protests in london at weekends "" .

2024-03-08T15:31:13.000Z,BBC,"an internal un report seen by the bbc has described widespread abuse of palestinians who were captured and interrogated at makeshift israeli detention centres during the ongoing war in gaza . the draft document compiled by the united nations relief and works agency ( unrwa ) , the main un agency supporting palestinians , includes detailed testimony from detainees who describe an extensive range of ill-treatment . they include being stripped and beaten , being forced into cages and attacked by dogs , forced into stress positions for extended periods , and subjected to "" blunt force trauma "" including the butts of guns and boots , resulting in some cases in "" broken ribs , separated shoulders and lasting injuries "" . it says both men and women reported "" threats and incidents of sexual violence and harassment "" including inappropriate touching of women and beatings to men's genitals . in a statement provided to the bbc , the israeli defense forces ( idf ) said : "" the mistreatment of detainees during their time in detention or whilst under interrogation violates idf values and contravenes idf and is therefore absolutely prohibited . "" it rejected specific allegations including the denial of access to water , medical care and bedding . the idf also said that claims regarding sexual abuse were "" another cynical attempt to create false equivalency with the systematic use of rape as a weapon of war by hamas "" . in earlier statements to the new york times and guardian newspapers , the israeli military said it was aware of deaths in detention , including those with pre-existing illnesses and wounds , and said every death was being investigated . unrwa's accounts tally with other reports of abuse in israeli detention centres recently published by israeli and palestinian human rights groups as well as separate un investigations . this latest un report , which has not been published yet , was based on interviews with more than 100 detainees , part of a group of about 1,000 detainees unrwa was able to document since december after they were freed from three israeli military sites . they included people - both male and female - between the ages of six and 82 , including 29 children . the agency explains that this information was obtained during its role co-ordinating humanitarian aid at the kerem shalom crossing point between gaza and israel where the idf has been releasing detainees . information was also said to have been provided "" independently and voluntarily "" by palestinians released from detention . in a comment sent to the bbc it described the allegations as "" shocking but unsurprising "" . the report said many palestinians were apprehended in northern gaza as they took refuge in hospitals or schools or as they tried to flee south to find shelter . others were gazans with work permits to enter israel . they were stranded in israel when war broke out and were later detained . unrwa estimates that more than 4,000 palestinians have been rounded up in gaza since the start of hostilities sparked by the hamas attack on 7 october when nearly 1,200 israelis , mostly civilians , were killed , and more than 250 israelis and foreigners were taken hostage . in the war which followed , now in its fifth month , more than 30,000 palestinians have been killed according to gaza's hamas-run health ministry . unrwa itself has been the focus of inquiry during this war . israel has repeatedly accused it of supporting hamas and hiring its members . the un agency , whose 13,000 staff are regarded as the backbone of humanitarian operations in gaza , has denied the charges . but it immediately terminated the contracts of employees accused in an israeli document of playing a part in the 7 october attacks . the claims , also being investigated by the un , led nearly 20 countries and institutions to suspend funding . but the eu recently resumed its support and others are reportedly preparing to do so . "" unrwa is facing a deliberate and concerted campaign to undermine its operations , and ultimately end them , "" commissioner general philippe lazzarini recently told a special meeting of the un general assembly amid calls in israel for the agency to be dismantled . in the introduction to its internal report , unrwa highlights that it is not a comprehensive account of all the issues regarding detentions during the war , including hostages held by hamas , or other concerns regarding the treatment of hostages in gaza by palestinian armed groups .","gaza faces famine during ramadan , the holy month of fasting"

2024-03-10T00:45:23.000Z,BBC,"the israel defense forces ( idf ) has finished building a new road which runs across northern gaza from east to west , according to satellite images verified by the bbc . the idf told the bbc they were attempting to gain an "" operational foothold "" , and facilitate the movement of troops and equipment . but some experts fear it will used as a barrier , preventing palestinians from returning to their homes in the north . others said it appeared to be part of an israeli plan to remain in gaza beyond the end of current hostilities . in february , prime minister benjamin netanyahu unveiled a post-war vision in which israel would control security in gaza indefinitely . international leaders have previously warned israel against permanently displacing palestinians or reducing the size of gaza . it runs across north gaza , with central and southern areas lying below it . it starts at gaza's border fence with israel near the nahal oz kibbutz and finishes near the coast . it also intersects with the salah al-din and al-rashid roads , the two major arteries running through the territory . although there is a network of roads which connect east and west , the new idf route is the only one which runs uninterrupted across gaza . satellite imagery analysis by the bbc reveals that the idf has built over 5km ( 3 miles ) of new road sections to join up previously unconnected roads . the initial section of the road in eastern gaza near the israeli border was established between late last october and early november . but most of the new sections were built during february and in early march . the new route is wider than a typical road in gaza , excluding salah al-din . imagery analysis also shows that buildings along the route , which appear to be warehouses , were demolished from the end of december until late january . this includes one building several stories high . the road spans an area which previously had fewer buildings and was less densely populated than other parts of gaza . it also sits below a makeshift and winding route which the idf had been using to move from east to west . an israeli tv channel reported on the route in february , saying it was code named "" highway 749 "" . a reporter from channel 14 travelled along parts of the route with the israeli military . in the video , road construction vehicles and diggers were seen preparing for the construction of new sections of the route . analysts at janes , a defence intelligence company , said the type of unpaved road surface seen in the channel 14 footage , was suitable for tracked armoured vehicles . the idf did not go into this type of detail in its statement . "" as part of the ground operation , the idf uses an operational route of passage , "" it said . retired brig gen jacob nagel , former head of israel's national security council and a former security adviser to mr netanyahu , told bbc arabic that the objective of the new route was to provide fast access for security forces when dealing with fresh threats . "" it will help israel go in and out . . . because israel is going to have total defence , security and responsibility for gaza , "" he told bbc arabic . he described it as "" a road that divides the northern part from the southern part "" . "" we don't want to wait until a threat is emerging , "" he added . maj gen yaakov amidror , formerly of the idf , had a similar view . the primary purpose of the new road was to "" facilitate logistical and military control in the region "" , he said . justin crump , a former british army officer who runs sibylline , a risk intelligence company , said the new route was significant . "" it certainly looks like it's part of a longer-term strategy to have at least some form of security intervention and control in the gaza strip , "" said mr crump . "" this area cuts off gaza city from the south of the strip , making it an effective control line to monitor or limit movement , and has relatively open fields of fire . "" khaled elgindy , a senior fellow at the us-based middle east institute , also thinks the road is a long-term project . "" it appears that the israeli military will remain in gaza indefinitely , "" he told the bbc . "" by dividing gaza in half , israel will control not only what goes in and out of gaza , but also movement within gaza , "" said the analyst . "" this includes quite possibly preventing the 1.5 million displaced palestinians in the south from returning to their homes in the north .

2024-03-11T11:01:05.000Z,BBC,"israel has unveiled its revised entry for the eurovision song contest , after the original version was rejected for its perceived political overtones . eden golan will now sing hurricane , a rewritten version of october rain , which was thought to reference the 7 october hamas attacks on israel . the soaring , impassioned piano ballad premiered on israeli tv on sunday . the lyrics now told the story of a woman experiencing a personal crisis , said israel's public broadcaster , kan . the european broadcasting union ( ebu ) , which organises eurovision , rejected october rain last month . lyrics such as "" there's no air left to breathe , "" and "" they were all good children , each one of them , "" were seen as references to the victims of hamas's deadly attack , which triggered israel's current ground offensive in gaza . kan initially refused to change the song , saying it would prefer to withdraw from the contest - but israel's president , isaac herzog , later called for "" necessary adjustments "" to ensure the country could participate . the broadcaster said : "" the president emphasised that at this time in particular , when those who hate us seek to push aside and boycott the state of israel from every stage , israel must sound its voice with pride and its head high and raise its flag in every world forum , especially this year . "" musically , hurricane is the same song as october rain - but the lyrics are now more general , with phrases such as "" every day , i'm losing my mind "" and "" i'm still broken from this hurricane . "" as expected , the phrase "" october rain "" has been excised completely . another significant change is the word "" flowers "" has been replaced by "" powers "" . according to the israel hayom newspaper , the former is often used to denote israel's war fatalities . the spoken-word section , which golan delivers in hebrew , has also been altered . the original references to poisoned air and dead children have been switched for the more generic : "" no need for big words , only prayers . even if it's hard to see , you always leave me one small light . "" as the song was revealed , golan , 20 , addressed the difficulty of representing israel at such a politically sensitive time . "" i ended up in a not simple year , "" she told the times of israel . "" but on the other hand , i even more so want to represent the country this year , because of its meaning - it has a totally different significance . "" and we can bring everything we're feeling , and everything the country is going through , in those three minutes . to speak through the song to the world . "" israel has won euorvision four times since its first appearance , in 1973 . last year , it was represented by pop sensation noa kirel , whose acrobatic dance number unicorn placed third . but the country has faced serious opposition to its participation in this year's contest , due to concerns over the humanitarian cost of the war in gaza . last week , belgium's french-speaking culture minister , benedicte linard , called for israel to be banned as long as the war continued . "" just like russia has been excluded from competitions and eurovision following its invasion of ukraine , israel should be excluded until it puts an end to its flagrant violations of international law , which are causing thousands of victims , especially children , "" she wrote on x , formerly known as twitter . israel insists its ground offensive is in line with international law . its military has repeatedly said it goes out of its way to try to avoid harming civilians . ms linard also told parliament on wednesday she would ask public broadcaster radio-télévision belge de la communauté française ( rtbf ) , which is organising belgium's entry to eurovision , to voice the concerns to the ebu . her flemish counterpart , benjamin dalle , said an israeli suspension would be appropriate while so many palestinian civilians were suffering , according to flemish broadcaster vrt . musicians in several countries have also called for israel to be suspended from the contest . before he was selected to represent the uk , olly alexander also endorsed a statement accusing israel of genocide . an israeli official later told the uk's daily telegraph newspaper the arguments were "" absurd "" and accused alexander and his fellow signatories of "" anti-israel bias "" . israel launched an air and ground campaign in gaza after hamas's 7 october attacks , in which about 1,200 people were killed and 253 taken hostage . more than 30,800 people have been killed in gaza since then , the territory's hamas-run health ministry says .",netanyahu orders military to plan evacuations from rafah
2024-03-12T06:00:11.000Z,BBC,"palestinian medical staff in gaza have told the bbc they were blindfolded , detained , forced to strip and repeatedly beaten by israeli troops after a raid at their hospital last month . ahmed abu sabha , a doctor at nasser hospital , described being held for a week in detention , where , he said , muzzled dogs were set upon him and his hand was broken by an israeli soldier . his account closely matches those of two other medics who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals . they told the bbc they were humiliated , beaten , doused with cold water , and forced to kneel in uncomfortable positions for hours . they said they were detained for days before being released . the bbc supplied details of their allegations to the israel defense forces ( idf ) . they did not respond directly to questions about these accounts , or deny specific claims of mistreatment . but they denied that medical staff were harmed during their operation . they said that "" any abuse of detainees is contrary to idf orders and is therefore strictly prohibited "" . warning : some readers may find details in this article distressing . the idf raided the hospital in the southern gazan city of khan younis - which was one of the few in the strip still functioning - on 15 february , saying intelligence indicated that the hospital housed hamas operatives . they also said israeli hostages taken by hamas on 7 october had been held there - and some of the hostages themselves have publicly said they were kept at nasser . hamas has denied that its fighters operate inside medical facilities . footage secretly filmed in the hospital on 16 february , the day the medics were detained , was shared with the bbc . it shows a row of men stripped to their underwear in front of the hospital's emergency building , kneeling with their hands behind their heads . medical robes are lying in front of some of them . "" anybody who tried to move his head or make any movement got hit , "" the hospital's general manager , dr atef al-hout , told the bbc . "" they left them for around two hours in this shameful position . "" the idf told the bbc : "" as a rule , during the arrest process , it is often necessary for terror suspects to hand over their clothes such that their clothes can be searched and to ensure that they are not concealing explosive vests or other weaponry . "" clothes are not immediately returned to the detainees , due to the suspicion they may conceal means that can be used for hostile purposes ( such as knives ) . detainees are given back their clothes when it's possible to do so . "" medical staff said that they were then taken into a hospital building , beaten , and then transported to a detention facility , all while undressed . dr abu sabha , the 26-year-old newly qualified doctor and volunteer medic at nasser , described some elements of his treatment while in detention as torture , such as making detainees stand for hours without a break . he said other punishments given to detainees included being made to lie on their stomach for prolonged periods and delaying their meals . an expert in humanitarian law said the footage and the testimony from the medical staff interviewed by the bbc was "" extremely concerning "" . he said some of the accounts provided to the bbc "" very clearly cross over into the category of cruel and inhumane treatment "" . dr lawrence hill-cawthorne , co-director of the centre for international law at the university of bristol , said : "" it goes against what has for a long time been a very fundamental idea in the law that applies in armed conflict , which is that hospitals and medical staff are protected . "" "" the fact that they treat nationals of the enemy side should not in any way undermine their protection , "" he said . the bbc has been investigating the hospital's story for several weeks , speaking to doctors , nurses , pharmacists and displaced people camping in the courtyard . we have cross-checked details in these accounts . we were given the names of 49 nasser medical personnel said to have been detained . of those , 26 were named by multiple sources , including medics on the ground , the hamas-run health ministry , international groups , and the families of those missing . the three medics who say they were detained and later released have not given their accounts publicly before . they include dr abu sabha , who we interviewed twice . his story remained consistent , and we corroborated key parts of his account independently . families of five other medics at the hospital have told the bbc their loved ones are missing . in addition , the international committee of the red cross has confirmed to the bbc that it has received dozens of phone calls from people who say family members , including medics , who were at nasser , are now missing . medics who remained at nasser say the idf's operation at the hospital left them unable to care for patients . when the idf took control , nearly 200 patients were being treated there , many of them "" bedridden "" , including six inside the icu , according to dr hout , the general manager . those staff allowed to remain have described being ordered to move seriously ill patients between buildings , being taken away from their duties to be interrogated , and assigned patients whose cases they were not trained to deal with , all as they worked in cramped , unsanitary conditions . multiple medics said that 13 patients died in the days after israel's takeover . they said many of those patients had died because of the conditions at the hospital , including a lack of electricity , water , and other essentials needed to keep nasser running . we cannot independently verify this . a doctor shared photos of bodies in bags on beds that we have confirmed were taken in a ward at the hospital . the idf told the bbc that it had "" provided the hospital with hundreds of food rations and an alternative generator that enabled it to continue functioning and treat the patients within it "" . the "" essential systems "" of the hospital kept functioning during the idf's operation on an uninterruptible power supply system , it said . on 18 february , the world health organization ( who ) said the hospital was short of food and basic medical supplies , and had ceased to function . the remaining patients were sent to other hospitals around gaza and the medical staff who worked there left shortly afterwards . released detainees and other medics told the bbc that the maternity building , called mubarak , became the place where the idf interrogated and beat staff . dr abu sabha said he was initially picked to stay with patients after the raid , but was later taken to mubarak , which he said had become "" more like a torture place "" . "" they put me on a chair and it was like a gallows , "" he said . "" i heard sounds of ropes , so i thought i was going to be executed . "" after that they broke a bottle and it [ the glass ] cut my leg and they left it to bleed . then they started bringing doctor after doctor in and started putting them next to each other . i was hearing their names and their voices . "" the idf told the bbc it "" does not and has not carried out mock executions of detainees , and rejects such claims "" . all three of the detainees the bbc spoke to said they were crammed onto military vehicles and beaten as they were transported in a large group . soldiers beat them with sticks , hoses , rifle butts and fists , they said . "" we were naked . just wearing boxers . they piled us on top of each other . and they took us out of gaza , "" one of the medics who wanted to remain anonymous said . "" all along the way we were being hit and sworn at and humiliated . and they poured cold water on us "" . dr abu sabha said that during the journey , soldiers took the detainees out of the vehicle . "" they took us to a patch of ground covered in gravel , forced us to kneel down and our eyes blind-folded … there was a pit in the ground , and we thought they would execute us and bury us here . we all started prayers . "" he was then driven to a building where he and the other detainees with him would be held , he said . the two other released detainees said that at some stage they were given medical checks but no medication . one said that instead of getting treatment for an injury , an idf soldier hit him where he was injured . dr abu sabha told the bbc that detainees were routinely punished for perceived infractions . "" at one point , the blindfold moved down a bit and my hands were handcuffed from behind and i could not fix it . "" they took me out for punishment … i was standing with my hands raised above my head and my face looking down for three hours . then , he [ a soldier ] asked me to come to him . when i did , he kept hitting my hand until it was broken . "" later that day , he was taken to the toilet , beaten , and had muzzled dogs set on him , he said . the day after , an israeli doctor fitted him with a cast and then soldiers drew a star of david on it , he said . this cast was later changed by a doctor in gaza and ahmed was wearing a cast during his interview with the bbc . the bbc confirmed that dr abu sabha had an x-ray and sought treatment for a broken hand at a field hospital in gaza after his detention , and that he arrived there in a cast with a star of david drawn on it . the idf did not address the bbc's questions about dr abu sahba's cast . none of the three medics were made aware of any specific charges , but two said interrogations focused on whether they had seen hostages or hamas fighters within the hospital . they said they were also asked about their whereabouts on 7 october , when hamas gunmen rampaged from gaza into israel and killed about 1,200 people , taking 253 others hostage . more than 130 hostages are still believed to be held by hamas . israeli officials have said at least 30 of them are dead . the hamas-run health ministry in gaza says more than 31,000 people have been killed in israel's retaliatory air strikes and its ongoing ground offensive . one of the released detainees said that two days after being interrogated , idf officers told him there was no evidence and he would be released . "" i asked him , ' who will compensate me for all the beatings and humiliation i've been through , that you did to me , while i knew that i wasn't involved in anything ? ' he started muttering , ' i don't have anything on you . no charges . ' "" dr abu sabha told the bbc he was never interrogated during his eight days of detention . the three medics we spoke to say they were transported back to gaza blindfolded after their release . the bbc has confirmed dr abu sabha's account that he crossed back into gaza at the israeli-controlled kerem shalom crossing , which is near the southernmost point of the strip where gaza , israel and egypt meet . the medics ' accounts are at odds with a separate briefing given to the bbc by a senior idf official who said that no arrests were made of medical staff at nasser , "" unless we knew that it was possible to get this or that intelligence information "" from them . "" we had reasonable grounds to assume that they have information , so we took them in for questioning and interrogation , but not beyond that , "" the official said . "" there were no handcuffs , we did not take them away for interrogation , nor for advanced arrest , but for the purpose of questioning and trying to obtain information about the hostages or the hamas commanders who were in the hospital … a very simple questioning and that's it . "" some hostages taken from israel on 7 october have described being brought into the nasser hospital complex in an ambulance . one released hostage said her husband - who remains in gaza - was covered in a sheet to look like a corpse . they have described being kept in small rooms and being forced to knock if they needed to go to the toilet . one has described her time in captivity as "" psychological warfare "" . the international committee of the red cross ( icrc ) says that since 7 october , israel has suspended its detention visits , meaning it has not been able to visit any detainees . it told the bbc it was "" deeply concerned "" by the reports of arrests and ongoing detention of medics . "" wherever and whoever they may be , detainees need to be treated humanely and with dignity at all times , in accordance of international humanitarian law , "" it said . "" the icrc has continuously called for , and is ready to immediately resume , detention visits in order to monitor the treatment of detainees and the conditions of detention . "" an internal un report seen by the bbc has described widespread abuse of palestinians who have been captured and interrogated at makeshift israeli detention centres since the war began , which are similar to the accounts the medics gave . the idf has previously denied specific allegations in the un report , including the denial of access to water , medical care and bedding . meanwhile , in nasser hospital , a few medics were allowed to stay and care for the remaining patients . some patients had been detained during the raid , according to dr hout , the general manager . in one video provided to us by a nasser eyewitness , idf soldiers wheel two hospital beds and the occupants ' hands are hoisted above their heads , zip-tied . we have verified it is authentic . in separate footage published by the idf , people can be seen lying on beds in the hospital grounds with their hands zip-tied , their arms in a similar raised position . we do not know who these people are , or what happened to them after this footage . the idf said : "" we emphasize that the hands of patients who were not suspected of involvement in terrorism were not tied . "" medics who remained were frightened of being shot if they defied orders not to leave the building , dr hatim rabaa , who also worked at nasser , told the bbc in a phone call on 22 february , as explosions sounded in the background . but nevertheless they went down to the yard to collect water , worrying that patients would otherwise die , he said . "" people were dying of thirst . on my shoulders i carried three gallons of water so that i can make people drink . what else could i do ? "" multiple medics said that the idf would not grant them permission to bury or even move the bodies of patients who died in the aftermath of the operation . the bodies remained inside with staff and patients as they began to decompose , the medics said . "" the smell filled the whole department , "" dr rabaa said . "" patients were screaming ' please remove them from here ' . i was telling them ' it isn't in my hands ' . "" dr rabaa was one of a small group of medics chosen to remain with patients . he said that he too had been stripped to his underwear and made to kneel in front of the emergency department - but he was then led away to the building where patients were kept . he said he does not know what happened to his colleagues he left behind in the courtyard . the bbc put detailed questions about the allegations to the israeli military . in its response , the idf told the bbc that "" about 200 terrorists and suspects of terrorist activity were detained , including some who posed as medical teams "" . they said that "" many weapons were found , as well as closed medicines intended for israeli hostages "" . they said they had operated in a "" precise and focused manner , creating minimal damage to the hospital's ongoing activity , and without harming the patients or the medical staff "" . additional reporting by muath al khatib and by bbc arabic's marie-jose al azzi and soha ibrahim verification by richard irvine-brown , benedict garman and emma pengelly , bbc verify visual journalism and design by gerry fletcher , lilly huynh and zoe bartholomew",israelis tell british mps of evidence of hamas sexual violence

"" the attempt to say that my policies are my private policies that are not supported by most israelis , is false . the vast majority are united as never before and they understand what's good for israel , "" mr netanyahu told the politico website on sunday . israel is the world's biggest cumulative recipient of us military aid , supplied by washington with around $ 3.8bn worth of weapons and defence systems each year . mr biden , caught on a "" hot-mic "" after his speech to congress , said he had told mr netanyahu he would have a "" come-to-jesus meeting "" with him , sparking speculation he could make a threat to cancel some weapons supply as leverage . mr biden later suggested an israeli assault on the city of rafah , where some 1.5 million mostly displaced palestinians have sought refuge , was a "" red line "" . but he also appeared to back-track , saying : "" the defence of israel is critical … there's no red line [ in which ] i'm going to cut off all weapons so they don't have the iron dome [ missile defence system ] . "" mr netanyahu responded during his interview on sunday , vowing to press ahead into rafah : "" we'll go there . we're not going to leave [ hamas ] . you know , i have a red line . you know what the red line is ? that october 7 doesn't happen again . never happens again . "" among critics of us policy are some who have spent decades implementing it . josh paul , a former senior official at the state department who resigned last year in protest over the impact of military assistance to israel , said the administration should abide by us laws that limit arms supplies if a country is deemed to be restricting access to us humanitarian aid . "" using the us air force , or building this pier [ to deliver aid ] … both of those are being done because the administration has not leaned on israel hard enough to open the ground lines of assistance to gaza . "" "" i think american military families need to be very aware that the president is making a decision to put their family members into harm's way , rather than leaning on an ally to follow its own obligations under international law , "" said mr paul . pressed by the bbc on monday over the extent of its influence , the us state department said it was the "" intervention of the united states that has led humanitarian assistance to go into gaza in the first place . "" "" the president of the united states travelled to israel and cemented a deal that secretary blinken initially reached to allow [ the ] rafah [ crossing with egypt ] to open , "" said state department spokesman matthew miller . israel's government denies blocking access , saying "" israel has placed no restrictions on the amount of food , water , medical or shelter equipment that can enter the gaza strip , "" blaming a "" backlog "" on un agencies which the un categorically rejects . dave harden , a former mission director at the us agency for international development ( usaid ) in the west bank and gaza , told the bbc that mr netanyahu didn't appear to be listening . "" he almost treats biden as some kind of inconsequential second secretary of a low-ranked european power … the gap between israel and the us just deepens , "" said mr harden .",gaza residents surviving off animal feed and rice as food dwindles

2024-03-14T02:52:33.000Z,BBC,"israel's military has said it plans to move displaced palestinians in gaza to what it called "" humanitarian islands "" in the middle of the strip , ahead of any offensive in rafah . some 1.4 million people are sheltering in the southern city after fleeing the fighting between israeli troops and hamas in northern and central areas . it is not clear what the "" islands "" will look like , or how they will operate . but the military suggested that aid and temporary housing would be provided . no timeframe has yet been given about when the operation could happen . the un and us have warned that a full-scale assault in rafah could be disastrous . israel has repeatedly signalled its need for such an operation , insisting hamas cannot be fully removed in gaza without targeting rafah . it is conscious , too , that the group's most senior leaders are still at large , almost certainly now in the southernmost part of the strip . the israeli military launched a campaign in gaza after hamas gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern israel on 7 october and took 253 other people hostage . gaza's hamas-run health ministry says more than 31,300 people have been killed in the territory since then . the chief spokesman of the israel defense forces ( idf ) , rear adm daniel hagari , said in a briefing to journalists on wednesday that they needed to make sure that all 1.4 million people currently living in rafah , or "" at least a significant amount "" , would leave ahead of any offensive . he suggested that they could move to "" humanitarian islands that we will create with the international community "" , where temporary housing , food and water would be provided . but there are still plenty of logistical questions to answer . moving more than half of gaza's population from rafah to the centre of the strip would take time , potentially weeks . cars are in short supply now , as is fuel for them , so most people would have to walk once again , carrying their belongings . palestinians are hungrier and weaker than they were five months ago , which would also make large-scale movement slow . the central part of the strip where israel proposes to relocate them has been badly damaged by repeated ground and air attacks . the us secretary of state , antony blinken , said he was yet to receive further details , but "" needed to see a plan to get civilians out of harm's way "" of any ground operation in rafah and ensure they had food , shelter and medicine . benny gantz , a member of israel's war cabinet , had suggested a new military operation would begin in rafah by the start of the islamic holy month ramadan if no new hostage release deal was agreed . that did not happen , but prime minister benjamin netanyahu continues to reference it when he addresses the israeli people . "" there is international pressure to prevent us from entering rafah and completing the work . as prime minister of israel , i reject this pressure , "" mr netanyahu told soldiers at ofer military base on thursday . "" we will enter rafah . we will complete the elimination of hamas's battalions . we will restore security and we will bring total victory for the people of israel and state of israel , "" he added . the idf would also need to bolster its numbers again ahead of any new ground offensive . many of the reservists who were called up in the early days of the war have now been released from duty , and would need to be brought back into operation . rear adm hagari told journalists that the idf was also "" trying to flood "" gaza with humanitarian aid by opening up multiple routes by land , sea and air . he said us military experts were due to arrive in israel this week to discuss with the idf a us plan to build a floating dock and temporary pier off gaza's coast . it would be able to receive containerloads of food , water and medicine . mr blinken emphasised that the floating dock , which will take between one and two months to become fully operational , would be "" a complement to - not a substitute for - other ways of getting humanitarian assistance into gaza "" . "" in particular , overland routes remain the most critical way to get assistance in and then to people who need it , "" he said . the un has warned that half a million people are on the brink of famine in gaza . israel , as the occupying power , has the responsibility to see that food and medicine gets to civilians .",israel gaza : palestinians sheltering in rafah fear impending offensive

"" warning : this article contains details some readers may find disturbing the bbc has spent several weeks establishing what happened at nasser , one of gaza's biggest and busiest hospitals until an israel defense forces ( idf ) raid last month . on tuesday , we revealed accusations from medical staff that they were detained , beaten and humiliated by idf forces during the raid , prompting the uk government to call for answers from israel . the us state department said israel has a "" moral responsibility "" to investigate credible reports of abuses or violations of humanitarian law . now , through witness testimony and analysis of verified video footage , we can show how the days leading up to the raid unfolded . medics , patients and displaced civilians sheltering outside the main entrance described how they were trapped as anyone who tried to move around would be shot at . the bbc has verified footage of 21 incidents of gunfire or its impact filmed from within the hospital grounds and has confirmed the shooting of three people there . we shared our findings in detail with the idf , along with questions about its operation at nasser . israel has repeatedly accused hamas fighters of using hospitals and medical centres as hiding places for weapons and command centres . it also says hamas and other armed organisations have used gaza's hospitals to hide hostages taken from israel on the 7 october attacks . the idf told the bbc there were "" active fights in the area "" in the days before its troops entered the hospital , and that "" precise shots "" had been fired at "" terrorists identified in the vicinity "" . once inside , the idf said , it found medicines that were intended for israeli hostages as well as weapons . hostages who were released during a brief truce in november have given accounts of being locked in rooms there . sharon aloni cunio has said she was taken to nasser in an ambulance , disguised in traditional arabic clothes , while her husband , who remains in gaza , was put under a sheet to look like a corpse . the couple , with their two young children and other hostages , spent weeks in a small room on the hospital's first floor , where stacked boxes separated the hostage section from other rooms , she said . others have given similar accounts of being held at the hospital , describing crying as they were locked in rooms there , having to knock on a door to be escorted to the toilet , and their terror at not knowing what would happen to them . those we spoke to in the hospital , including international medics who have stayed and worked there since the war began , say there was no overt presence of hamas fighters they were aware of . following the raid , the idf said some 200 terror suspects had been detained , including some who had "" posed as medics "" . in the days before the raid , the fear in nasser was building , and almost everyone we spoke to who was in the hospital at this time believed idf snipers and drones were targeting people moving between buildings on the hospital site or standing by windows . "" they surrounded the hospital with tanks , with bulldozers , quadcopters in the sky , snipers were everywhere , "" said 26-year-old dr mahmoud shammala , an oral and maxillo-facial surgeon . "" we can't stand by the window because if we stand by the window we'll get shot in our heads or even chests or even shoulders . and also bombing is everywhere . . . it was very difficult times , especially in those last days . "" people in the hospital grounds had little protection from gunfire . "" a lot of displaced people who were living in the complex were walking around normally and they got targeted , "" said nasser doctor mohammed harara . "" it got to the point where we couldn't reach these injured people . if you want to go to bring someone who's injured inside , it's like sacrificing or endangering yourself . a lot of people tried to go to save their brothers , relatives , anyone who they knew who was injured . they were targeted directly when they tried to reach them . "" when asked about reports of shootings of people within nasser , the idf responded that it fired only "" precise shots at terrorists "" identified around the hospital complex . on 8 february , a nurse , hazim abu omar , was shot and wounded while on shift inside the operating department . multiple people the bbc spoke to referred to the incident , including two doctors who said they were in the room at the time . footage shared online by a nasser doctor shows the injured nurse being rushed into an operating theatre on foot and appear to start to lose consciousness as colleagues struggle to cut away his blood-soaked clothing . it is not possible to determine who fired the shot , and the idf did not respond to requests for comment on this . the same day , a video shows people in civilian clothing using an improvised pulley system to get water to a group of people gathered near the grounds of one of the three schools located near the hospital . when a man attempts to get across the street , a loud gunshot can be heard . it does not strike him but the bbc's assessment of the audio suggests it was fired close to where the video was filmed at the hospital's north gate . in other videos posted that day , the buzz of drones can be heard in the sky overhead as people move through the hospital grounds in fear . ibrahim salama was shot in both legs when he went outside on 10 february to see who was screaming . the pain , he told the bbc , was unimaginable . as he lay in the shack covered in blood , a doctor who was too scared to approach was calling to him and telling him to keep talking , trying to make sure he didn't lose consciousness . others stood frozen , filming videos and taking photos on their phones . by the time dr assouli arrived at his side , ibrahim had been lying there for about an hour . she and the other medics put him on a stretcher and rushed him inside the hospital a video from the same day shows a man crawling along the ground as he tries to reach an injured or dead person lying just a few feet from the hospital grounds . the same body can be seen still lying there in a video posted a day later , suggesting no one felt it was safe enough to step out into that street to retrieve it . "" we can't go from one building to another building . the snipers will shoot at anybody who would move in the hospital yard . nobody can move outside of the buildings , "" dr mohammed moghrabi said in a video posted on instagram that day . on 11 february , two separate pieces of footage emerged of a corpse lying on the ground between the main hospital building and the gate on to al-dahra road . dr harara said bodies could stay in these positions for four or five days , with cats and dogs "" eating their flesh "" . the bbc has verified footage of dead bodies left to rot on the ground , close to the gate . cats can be seen crawling over the corpses . the chaos and confusion in nasser escalated further on 13 february when a handcuffed man dressed in a white jumpsuit with a piece of yellow fabric tied around his head entered the complex with orders for people to leave . he was identified to the bbc by people at the hospital as jamal abu al-ola , a palestinian man staying at the hospital who had disappeared a day earlier . the overalls he was wearing are the same as those worn by other men detained by the idf . eyewitnesses said he entered the hospital three times that day , following a precise route , and with a drone overhead . the second time , there appeared to be a cut on his face . "" he was speaking in an unnatural way . he was so scared from everything they [ the idf ] were saying to him , "" dr harara told the bbc . "" his mum was there and at that time she told him ' please come and stay with us , don't go back for them ' . he told her ' i need to go back , i cannot stay .

"" on the third occasion , as he left the hospital , eyewitnesses say he was shot dead . "" [ he ] was executed before our eyes . in front of the displaced and in front of his mother , "" one displaced person staying on the hospital grounds told the bbc . nobody the bbc spoke to saw where the bullet came from . the idf did not respond to bbc questions about jamal's death , but has previously said that the "" incident in question "" was under review . doctors at nasser reported more shootings within the hospital grounds on this day . dr khaled serr posted on instagram saying that two boys had been shot while playing , and in a voicenote from the time , shared with the bbc , he said three civilians were shot in front of the hospital gates . "" one of them has a bullet inside his abdomen , "" he said . photos of each of the boys dr serr said were shot while playing match a video posted on the same day by a journalist who was in the complex at the time and verified by the bbc . we cannot independently confirm the circumstances of the shootings . on the same day , a tank knocked down part of the wall surrounding the nasser complex . orders for people to leave were made over loudspeakers on israeli military vehicles . "" get out immediately . . . those who would not get out risk their lives . all those that are inside the hospital , get out at once , "" a message blared in arabic . on 14 february , a drone circled above nasser . a voice ordered everyone to leave . the israeli raid was about to begin . ibrahim left on crutches . he describes seeing "" bodies of people all around "" , some "" being eaten by cats "" . as he left through an israeli checkpoint , he says he saw many people around him being detained . while ibrahim had escaped , things at nasser were only getting more intense . in the early hours of 15 february , a shell hit the orthopaedic department , killing one person , according to the hospital's general manager , atef al-hout . in reference to its operation at nasser , the idf said a "" stray shell "" had been fired towards a military target nearby and had accidentally hit a building inside the hospital . however , it did not specify which building it was referring to . a video shows the medics who had remained at the hospital pulling the injured from a room reduced to rubble . and for those who chose to leave , the road was not safe . the bbc has verified footage of dr harara among a group of people who came under fire just over 2km from the hospital as they headed south from khan younis towards the southern city of rafah on 15 february . he is seen shouting for help as he frantically applies a tourniquet to an injured woman's leg . in a later fragment of video , she is seen lying in the back of a car being driven away from the scene when another loud bang is heard . in another video , a group of men - some of whom are wearing medical scrubs - flee when one steps into the street and comes under fire . back at nasser hospital , a crack of gunfire can be heard on video before an injured man crawls back through a door in the emergency building . he is dragged away along the floor as blood gushes from his injury and he groans in pain . among those who remained at the hospital were patients who could not move , displaced people with nowhere to go , and medics who felt duty-bound to stay . "" where could i evacuate with a diabetic husband who needs to have a bathroom next to him , and is on a walker . i cannot live in a tent or on the sand so i stayed , "" one woman told the bbc . during israel's takeover of the hospital , those who remained describe surviving on limited food and water , performing ablutions , or cleansing before prayers , using the fluid from medical drips and living in cramped and unsanitary conditions after being moved into a single building . they feared being shot if they returned to the yard . the idf has said its operations at nasser were conducted in a "" precise and focused manner , creating minimal damage to the hospital's ongoing activity , and without harming the patients or the medical staff "" . on 16 february , medics at the hospital were forced to strip and kneel with their hands behind their heads in front of the shack where ibrahim had been shot almost a week earlier . many were then detained . two days later , the world health organization declared nasser was no longer functional . the idf ended its operation there on 25 february . in its statement , the idf added : "" [ t]he idf forces provided the hospital with hundreds of food rations and an alternative generator that enabled it to continue functioning and treat the patients within it . "" after the israeli operation ended , the doctors who remained at nasser say it was looted by local gazans and they fled .

2024-03-14T16:45:36.000Z,BBC,"us senate majority leader chuck schumer has called for israel to hold elections to replace prime minister benjamin netanyahu , as cracks appear in a once stable and friendly alliance . mr schumer , the highest-ranking jewish official in us government , said on thursday mr netanyahu had lost his way . leaders in washington have avoided directly criticising mr netanyahu's approach to the conflict in gaza it is a sharp escalation in us criticism of mr netanyahu's government . mr schumer , who has backed israel throughout his 25 years in the senate , warned those casualties in gaza risked turning israel into a "" pariah "" . speaking in the senate on thursday , mr schumer , a long-time supporter of israel , harshly criticised the israeli leader , who he said had come to allow "" his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of israel "" . israel , mr schumer said , must make "" course corrections "" and take steps to better protect civilians in gaza . israel's leaders were quick to reproach the senator , with mr netanyahu's likud party saying israel is not a "" banana republic "" and that the prime minister's policies are "" supported by a large majority "" . "" it is expected of senator schumer to respect israel's elected government and not undermine it , "" the party said . israel's ambassador in washington , michael herzog , also attacked the remarks , writing on x that it was "" unhelpful "" and "" counterproductive "" to comment on "" the domestic political scene of a democratic ally "" . the statement from one of america's most powerful political leaders come on the heels of pointed critiques from white house . washington leaders from both parties , including president joe biden , have mostly refrained from criticising how mr netanyahu has handled the conflict , which began when hamas gunmen stormed into southern israel on 7 october , killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 others hostage . while the us remains israel's closest ally and biggest provider of military aid , concerns have been mounting within the biden administration and among some members of his own party over israel's handling of the war . mr biden , who is running again for the white house , is also facing political pressures in this presidential election year . a coalition of arab-american voters have organised successful protest efforts during the democratic primary process , a sign of growing restlessness in the democratic base about the situation in gaza . cracks began to publicly emerge between the two governments recent weeks , with mr biden warning israel against expanding its invasion into the city of rafah , which he called a "" red line "" . in his state of the union address last week , mr biden also called israel's response in the territory "" over the top "" . after the speech , he was caught on a hot mic telling a concerned senator that he and the israeli leader would soon have a "" come to jesus moment "" . when alerted to the live audio , mr biden replied : "" that's good . "" and president biden has become increasingly vocal in calling for israel to let more humanitarian aid into the enclave , with "" no excuses "" . nonetheless , the white house was quick to distance itself from mr schumer's comments on thursday . spokesperson john kirby said that while the senate leader had a right to his opinion , administration officials were focused on working with israel on its defence . more than 30,000 palestinians - the majority of them children and women - have now been killed in gaza since 7 october , the hamas-run health ministry said last month . the actual number of dead is likely to be far higher as the count does not include those who have not reached hospitals , among them thousands of people still lost under the rubble of buildings hit by israeli air strikes . mr netanyahu said on sunday that he could not accept the figure of 30,000 . he said israel's military had killed 13,000 hamas fighters in gaza and that it estimated the ratio of civilian deaths to combatant deaths was 1 to 1.5 . in his thursday remarks , mr schumer said : "" as a democracy , israel has the right to choose its own leaders , and we should let the chips fall where they may . "" but the important thing is that israelis are given a choice . there needs to be a fresh debate about the future of israel . "" "" in my opinion , that is best accomplished by holding an election , "" he added . israel is next due to hold a general election by october 2026 . for peace talks to advance , mr schumer said palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , who is based in the occupied west bank , must also step down . the palestinian leader , who is 88 , has been little seen throughout the conflict and his government has not held elections since 2006 . on wednesday , mr abbas , who has been under pressure from the us to reform the palestinian authority , appointed his former adviser as prime minister . mr schumer's comments prompted a rebuke from outgoing republican senate leader mitch mcconnell , who called the 40-minute speech "" grotesque "" and "" unprecedented "" . he said it was "" hypocritical for americans who hyperventilate about foreign interference in our own democracy to call for the removal of a democratically elected leader of israel "" . opinion polls show most israelis support the war , but one survey released in january suggested just 15 % of voters wanted mr netanyahu to remain in office once the conflict ends . meanwhile , the us revealed sanctions against three more settlers and for the first time against two israeli settlement outposts it accused of undermining stability in the occupied west bank . there were nearly 500 israeli settler attacks against palestinians between 7 october and 31 january , according to un figures . the vast majority of the international community considers the settlements and outposts illegal under international law , though israel and the us dispute this interpretation .",bournemouth beach children's clothes protest over israel-gaza war

"" they said the turkish envoy hadn't arrived . is our life not as important as the arrival of the turkish envoy ? how is someone supposed to get out ? or is it because we're not well connected ? "" she said . palestinian border agents said that because the turkish envoy was not there to receive siham on the egyptian side , they could not let her through . but we have spoken to others who were allowed to travel to turkey that day . mona al-shorafi was diagnosed with breast cancer three years ago , and had been receiving treatment in jerusalem before 7 october . she had been co-ordinating an initiative to provide psychological support for other cancer survivors and was just three days away from her next chemotherapy session when the war began . "" we had to leave our homes and stay in shelters and schools with many other families , and we were very worried because of our weak immune systems , "" she said . mona's name was on the same evacuation list as siham's on 19 november . she was allowed to cross the border to egypt , and boarded a plane to ankara along with more than 130 others , she told us . she was even allowed to take her two young daughters with her , although each patient is only officially allowed one companion . "" i had decided that if they turned one of my daughters back i wouldn't cross , i couldn't leave them behind , "" said mona . her husband and sons are still living in a tent in the tal al-sultan area of rafah . palestinian border authorities in gaza did not respond to our questions about why siham was refused permission to leave . we have spoken to two other cancer patients who were turned away at the border despite their names being on the evacuation lists . one of them , who did not want to be named , told us he was also supposed to leave on 19 november , but believed he was turned away because his companion was his young son . he said palestinian border authorities prefer female companions for evacuees , in order to reduce the chances that those leaving could be hamas fighters . another patient , who was supposed to be evacuated to the uae for treatment in december , was told at the border that the officials could not find her name . dr sobhi skaik , director of the turkish-palestinian friendship hospital in gaza , told us that out of gaza's estimated 10,000 cancer patients , "" the names of approximately 3,800 have been given permission to leave gaza for treatment abroad , but in reality only around 600 have left the gaza strip since the start of the war , whether adults or children "" . we have spoken to doctors in gaza , palestinian health ministry officials in the occupied west bank , and palestinian diplomats in egypt to better understand the complex evacuation process . a doctor or hospital in gaza nominates the patients in need of the most urgent medical care to the hamas-run health ministry in gaza . those names are then sent to the egyptian authorities , who run a security check . once egypt has approved the list , it is then vetted by the israeli authorities , who must also approve the names . when the final list is approved , it is shared with the countries who have said they are willing to receive patients and is published online . each group of patients is approved for travel on a specific date . but whether a patient is ultimately allowed to leave is up to the discretion of the palestinian border authorities . in response to why more patients were not being allowed through , the israeli ministry of defence told us : "" the rafah crossing is governed by egypt . there is , therefore , no restriction as far as israel is concerned regarding the number of patients that can cross at the rafah crossing to obtain medical treatment outside the gaza strip . "" the egyptian health ministry , the egyptian foreign ministry , and the palestinian border authorities declined to answer our questions on the evacuation process of patients from gaza . turkey said in early november that it was willing to take up to 1,000 cancer patients , while the uae announced that it would also take in 1,000 cancer patients and 1,000 injured children . turkish officials told us the country was currently treating several hundred cancer patients and injured from gaza , and it was willing to receive hundreds more . "" if gaza gives us a list of 600 people , we do not pick and choose a certain number of those . for us , the more patients and injured people who can be sent , the better . we have the capacity to treat all of them , "" one of them said . but there are other ways people are getting out of gaza . the war has given rise to a lucrative monopoly , with one egyptian travel agency , hala , reported to be charging palestinians $ 5,000 ( £ 3,900 ) per person to leave gaza within one to two weeks . before the war , it used to charge about $ 350 ( £ 274 ) per person to go from gaza to egypt . after 7 october , the price reportedly rocketed to almost $ 12,000 per person , before the company limited it to $ 5,000 for an adult palestinian and $ 2,500 for a child - though hala does not officially advertise this . this cost of evacuating one adult is more than four times the average annual salary in gaza . outside hala's offices in cairo , people crowd daily , trying to get a foot through the door . one palestinian man , who did not want to be named , told us he had to pay to enter the company's office , and made another extra payment of $ 300 to a member of staff at hala to get his family on the evacuation list . this was in addition to the $ 10,000 he paid to evacuate his wife and two children . we spoke to 10 people who used hala's services to try to leave gaza who said they had made payments of up to $ 4,000 to employees in order to secure preferential treatment for their families ' evacuations . some of them have left and some are still waiting to leave . the high demand has also given rise to a secondary market of brokers who prey on the desperation of palestinians with families trapped in gaza and claim they can get people to the top of the evacuation list - for a price . one broker in egypt told a woman that she could pay him an extra $ 2,500 to get her family in gaza on the evacuation list . in voice messages that she shared with us , the broker says that his contact in hala "" has to hold the money in his hand "" before he registers the names and insists : "" i'm doing this to help you , i'm not taking one [ israeli ] shekel even . "" but the best connected in gaza can leave without paying at all . we found the names of palestinians who left gaza posing as egyptian citizens , who told us they were helped to leave gaza by people with political connections , who had added their names to the egyptian citizens ' list . another woman , whose son needed urgent medical care , said people with political connections helped them to get on to a special vip list , which is not published online . she told us that her son's name "" did not show up on the health ministry's list . his name was on another special list "" which was read out at the border . neither hala nor the egyptian foreign ministry responded to our questions about the company's activities . egypt's foreign minister sameh shoukry previously told sky news that his country was investigating . "" we will take whatever measures that we need so as to restrict it and eliminate it immediately , "" he said , without giving further details . in january , egypt's state information service head diaa rashwan said it "" categorically denied the allegations related to the collection of additional fees from travellers from gaza , as well as claims that an unofficial entity collected fees for the passage to egyptian lands "" . in gaza , time is running out for siham and cancer patients like her , who are caught up in murky regulations and red tape at the border . desperate to get her out , her son saqr told us he tried to arrange for her to be evacuated through the hala company . "" if we had the money we wouldn't have hesitated . when we asked about a private evacuation they said the minimum hala asks for is $ 5,000 , but we can't afford $ 5,000 . "" after her first attempt to cross , siham said she went back to the border four more times to see if they would let her through , as her name had already been approved . but she was refused by palestinian border authorities , and her health is now quickly deteriorating . "" i can hardly walk a step without feeling dizzy now . i don't know what they're waiting for , "" she said .",senate advances aid package for ukraine and israel
2024-03-15T06:00:04.000Z,BBC,"the us has announced sanctions against three more israeli settlers and - for the first time - two farming outposts , as part of new measures by washington and london to stop the violent displacement of palestinians in the occupied west bank . fares samamreh may not carry a gun , but he has a global superpower defending him . he's still losing the fight . a palestinian sheep farmer on the sun-tinged slopes of the south hebron hills in the occupied west bank , his battle with his neighbour , an israeli settler called yinon levy , has drawn both the us and the uk into the dispute . "" yinon levy came here three years ago and started bothering me , "" fares said , his head wrapped in a piece of white cotton , his eyes narrowed in a permanent squint against the sun . "" before the war [ in gaza ] it was the usual thing ; they would come with drones . but a few days after 7 october , it became serious . they all had guns . they started coming to us day and night . i have little kids - some of them are four and five years old . "" fares said yinon was one of a group of local israeli settlers who would regularly come to harass his sheep with their dogs and weapons , and even , he says , to assault his family . "" they destroyed water tanks , closed down roads , they fire at the sheep , "" he said . "" he told my wife if we didn't leave here , we'd all be killed . "" he said when his wife then swore at him , yinon levy hit her with the butt of his gun . soon afterwards , fares and his family left their village of zanuta . activists say it's one of four communities around the settler's farm that have been abandoned by their residents . yinon has denied acting violently towards palestinians in the area - and said he didn't own a gun until very recently . but he's the subject of sanctions from both the us and the uk . the road to yinon's farm is straight out of a children's picture-book ; a narrow path that winds back and forth up a steep hill , slopes and valleys dropping away to the horizon on either side . at the top , a spacious bungalow stands next to a large shed , full of bleating sheep smothering the strains of pop music from a radio . "" we're safeguarding these lands to ensure they remain under jewish ownership , "" yinon said . "" when there is a jewish presence , then there is no arab presence . we keep a watchful eye on the land , ensuring that no unauthorised construction takes place . "" most countries deem the settlements , which are built on land captured by israel in 1967 in the middle east war , to be illegal under international law , although israel disagrees . the settler outposts are also illegal under israeli law . the uk said that yinon and another man had "" used physical aggression , threatened families at gunpoint , and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace palestinian communities "" . yinon denied the allegations , and said that the israeli government was on his side . "" i'm not worried , "" he told the bbc . "" this is not against me personally - it's against those who obstruct the creation of a palestinian state . there's no legal process against me [ in israel ] . here , everything is fine . "" both the uk and the us say there is a threshold of evidence that must be met - but neither have made that evidence public and declined to share it with the bbc . we sent yinon a video appearing to show him on palestinian land , approaching activists with a snarling dog . he said it was misleading , and that he was defending his flock . we sent him another video apparently showing him entering another palestinian village with a gun last october . he declined to comment . the sanctions came after a surge in violence in the west bank , following the 7 october hamas attacks and israel's war in gaza . the un says violence by israeli settlers included physical attacks and death threats , and that the number of palestinians displaced from their homes last year doubled to 1,539 - with more than 80 % of them leaving after 7 october . the uk has said israel is failing to act , and has described "" an environment of near total impunity for settler extremists in the west bank "" . yinon said that he had received support from israeli politicians . "" many called and encouraged us , "" he said . "" everyone said that when the bad people are against you , you must be doing something right . "" one of the politicians who publicly backed yinon in the wake of the sanctions was zvi sukkot of the ultranationalist religious zionism party - a settler himself . he said that settler violence was a "" marginal phenomenon "" and that those like levy were the victims of conspiracies . "" when we have a functioning judicial system in israel , we don't want our allies to say , ' we'll do the job for you ' , "" he said . "" if there was evidence against yinon levy , he would be in israeli prison . who is britain to come and say , ' we are smarter than israeli intelligence ' ? "" the israeli police commander responsible for investigating complaints in the west bank told mr sukkot's parliamentary committee this week that half the complaints filed about settler violence there were false , and that they originated from "" radical left-wing organisations in tel aviv "" . against this backdrop , sanctions on a handful of individual settlers have not shifted israeli policies in the west bank , but they are having a financial impact . yinon's israeli bank account was frozen last month . some of those currently under us and uk sanctions have used crowdfunding to finance projects for their area - including one for a synagogue and educational centre at another hilltop outpost called moshe's farm . its owner , moshe sharvit , was sanctioned along with yinon levy last month . but on thursday the us expanded sanctions to cover several new targets , including the farm itself - putting this kind of funding at risk . these sanctions may be more symbolic than substantial , but they signal american displeasure - both to israel's leaders , and to the parts of president biden's democratic base who have been dismayed by images of the war in gaza , in an election year . the chairman of the local yesha ( settlers ) council , shlomo ne'eman , called it "" a disgusting phenomenon "" and said the west bank was being used as a scapegoat . "" i think more than anything , what drives the response of the uk [ and ] the us is the fear of one settler attack that goes ' out of control ' , "" said yehuda shaul , founder of the ofek centre , a think tank which campaigns to end israel's occupation . "" the west bank [ then ] erupts like a volcano . and we have another front , as if gaza is not enough , and the road to regional war is almost unstoppable then . "" two sheep farmers in the occupied west bank - one backed by a superpower , the other by the israeli state . if the lifestyle here is simple , the politics are complicated . from yinon's hilltop farm , you can clearly see the ruins of zanuta perched on the next hill , with the home fares samamreh left months ago . many of the houses are ravaged - roofs and furniture taken by their owners into exile ; walls smashed by settlers to prevent them returning , activists say . the deserted village is slowly being taken over by vast banks of wild mallow . on a post near the entrance , a large star of david has been scrawled in blue paint . settlers here point to attacks by palestinians , and say they are scared . but it's palestinians who are leaving .",lovelock hostage bridge to recognise israeli hostages in gaza

"" approximately one hour before the arrival of the convoy to the humanitarian corridor , armed palestinians opened fire while gazan civilians were awaiting the arrival of the aid convoy , "" it said . the firing continued as a crowd looted the trucks and some people were run over , the idf said , adding that it was continuing to review the incident . despite rejecting the latest hamas ceasefire proposal , mr netanyahu said an israeli delegation would travel to qatar to discuss what israel wanted from a potential agreement . he also approved plans for a military operation in the southern gaza city of rafah , where more than a million people from other parts of gaza are sheltering . the army was preparing for the evacuation of civilians , he said . on thursday the idf said it planned to move displaced palestinians in gaza to what it called "" humanitarian islands "" in the middle of the strip . it is not clear what the "" islands "" will look like , or how they will operate . but the military suggested that aid and temporary housing would be provided . no timeframe has yet been given about when the operation could happen . the un and us have warned that a full-scale assault in rafah could be disastrous but israel has repeatedly signalled its need for such an operation , insisting hamas cannot be fully removed in gaza without targeting rafah . on friday us secretary of state antony blinken said the us needed to see a clear and implementable plan for any rafah operation , including for how to get civilians out of harm's way , and had not yet seen one . meanwhile a ship towing a barge loaded with 200 tonnes of food supplies arrived off the gaza coast and began unloading its cargo of rice , flour , legumes , canned vegetables and canned proteins . the us charity behind the mission , world central kitchen , said two crates had been delivered to shore from the barge attached to the open arms salvage vessel , which has stopped offshore . the quickest , most effective way to get aid into the territory is by road . but aid agencies say israeli restrictions mean a fraction of what is needed is getting in . israel says it welcomes the creation of a maritime corridor and that it is facilitating the transfer of aid to gaza while its forces continue to fight hamas . on friday , australia said it would resume funding to unrwa - the main united nations aid agency in gaza . australia and several other donors paused funding two months ago when israel accused some of its staff of involvement in the 7 october attack on israel by hamas . australian foreign minister penny wong said government lawyers had advised that unrwa "" was not a terrorist organisation "" . canada , sweden and the eu have already said they will resume funding to unrwa but its biggest donor , the us , is maintaining a payment freeze . ms wong urged israel to let more food into gaza .

"" it directs aid to big families who agree to embrace its agenda , while targeting those who refuse , "" the think tank said . the un's most senior human rights official , volker türk , said in a bbc interview recently that israel bore significant blame , and that there was a "" plausible "" case that israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in gaza . mr türk , who is the un high commissioner for human rights , said that if intent was proven , that would amount to a war crime . israel's economy minister nir barkat dismissed mr türk's warnings as "" total nonsense - a totally irresponsible thing to say "" . ashdod port , 32km ( 20 miles ) north of gaza , is one of israel's three main cargo ports and can handle more than 1.5 million containers a year . however , there have been no reports of aid shipments for gaza being received at ashdod . on wednesday israel's channel 12 reported that no preparations had been made to open ashdod to humanitarian shipments . because not enough aid has been getting into gaza by land , countries have been trying alternative routes via the skies and sea - but these too have been beset by problems . of the two schemes to get food and other aid into gaza by sea , only one has begun operation and it has now been paused after the israeli military attacked wck , the aid agency that was unloading and distributing the aid from a jetty it had constructed from rubble . last month , the first vessel to reach gaza under the scheme arrived from cyprus - the nearest eu country to gaza - towing a barge carrying about 200 tonnes of food provided by wck . by late march , wck boss josé andrés said that 67 wck kitchens were operating in gaza , feeding 350,000 people a day . meanwhile , a separate us military plan is in train , with a us navy ship on its way carrying materials to build a floating dock and pier , to enable supplies on far larger cargo ships to get ashore . according to the us defence department , it will mean two million meals a day could enter gaza . but it is not expected to be ready for months . the us , jordan , egypt , france , the netherlands and belgium are among the countries to have dropped aid into gaza , but aid groups say the technique is a last resort that can't on its own meet the need . at least 20 palestinians are reported to have been killed during air drops - five when a parachute on an aid package failed to open and the crate fell on people waiting below , and the others when aid packages fell in the sea and desperate people drowned while trying to retrieve them . air forces such as the uk's raf normally drop aid at an altitude as low as 400ft ( 120m ) , but the israelis have stipulated they must do so no lower than 2,000ft ( 610m ) . that means the parachutes have a long time to get blown off course by the wind and is why some airdrops in recent weeks have landed in the sea . a c-130 transport plane can carry 21 tons of aid - about the same quantity as can be carried by a single truck . there is also no way of organising the distribution on the ground . the first aid drop by the us on 3 march , carried out jointly with jordan , contained enough food for more than 38,000 meals . on 11 april , us central command , or centcom , said the us had dropped 855 tons of humanitarian assistance in total .",jewish man told to leave paul currie gig says london is scary

"" we have been described as a no-go area by a senior conservative mp , and received notice from the government that an immediate inspection of the council would begin that day and continue over the coming months , "" he said .

2024-03-15T20:11:13.000Z,BBC,"the first maritime humanitarian aid shipment to gaza has been unloaded on to the shore . the us charity behind the mission , world central kitchen ( wck ) , is carrying out the mission in co-operation with the united arab emirates . the shipment contained 200 tonnes of food desperately needed for gaza , which the un says is on the brink of famine . aid agencies have accused israel of impeding aid deliveries , a charge vehemently denied by israeli officials . they say israel is allowing aid through two crossings in the south and has blamed aid agencies of logistical failures . much of the gaza strip has been devastated during the israeli military operations that began after hamas gunmen attacked southern israel on 7 october , killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages . more than 31,400 people have been killed in gaza since then , the hamas-run health ministry says . saturday's shipment arrived on board spanish charity ship open arms . its cargo includes beans , carrots , canned tuna , chickpeas , canned corn , parboiled rice , flour , oil , salt and pallets of dates , which hold spiritual significance during ramadan . it had been checked by israeli officials in port in cyprus . it marks the start of a trial to see if the sea route would be more effective than air and land deliveries . aid agencies have repeatedly warned that no method of relief is as effective as delivery by land , but they say israeli restrictions mean a fraction of what is needed is getting in . in a statement , wck said : "" all cargo was offloaded and is being readied for distribution in gaza . "" teams worked through the night to get the aid on to dry land . gaza has no functioning port , so a makeshift jetty stemming from the shoreline was built by wck's team using rubble from destroyed buildings . however , there are few details on how the aid distribution will work , with un relief agencies having described huge obstacles to getting relief supplies to those in need . earlier , wck's founder , celebrity chef josé andrés , wrote on x ( formerly twitter ) that all the food aid from the barge had been loaded into 12 lorries . "" we did it ! "" he wrote , adding that this was a test to see if they could bring even more aid in the next shipment - up to "" thousands of tons a week "" . in a statement , the israel defense forces ( idf ) said troops had been deployed to secure the shoreline . this delivery has been highly anticipated since the ship set off from the port of larnaca on tuesday . cypriot president nikos christodoulides told journalists : "" the first ship has started its return to cyprus , and we are ready to dispatch the second ship . "" the second cargo vessel is at larnaca's port awaiting a signal to sail with 240 tons of aid including bulk products . wck said in addition it would carry two forklifts and a crane to help with future maritime deliveries to gaza . if this sea mission is deemed a success , other aid ships will likely follow as part of an international effort to get more aid into gaza . the ships would use a newly opened sea route to travel directly to the region . separately , the us is planning to build its own floating dock off the coast to boost sea deliveries . the white house says it could see two million meals a day enter gaza , but while a military ship is en route with equipment on board to build the dock , questions remain about the logistics of the plan . the world food programme had to temporarily pause its land deliveries after convoys came under gunfire and looting . and an air drop turned deadly last week when five people were reportedly killed when a parachute failed and they were hit by the aid package . the un has warned that famine is "" almost inevitable "" in gaza without urgent action , and the eu's foreign policy chief joseph borrell has accused israel of creating a "" manmade "" disaster and using starvation as a weapon of war . the israeli army has continued its attacks across the gaza strip with reports of at least 36 people killed after a house near the nuseirat refugee camp in central gaza was struck . it comes as israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu approved plans for an assault on the southern city of rafah , which is sheltering more than a million displaced people . negotiations for a ceasefire in gaza are due to resume on sunday . on friday , israel dismissed hamas's latest proposal . hamas said it gave mediators a "" comprehensive vision "" of a truce , but mr netanyahu called this "" unrealistic "" . israel's spy chief , david barnea , is expected to meet qatar's prime minister and egyptian officials in doha on sunday to iron out "" the remaining gaps between israel and hamas "" .",israel-gaza war : ' violent ' strikes reported in gazan city of rafah
2024-03-16T00:05:29.000Z,BBC,"on the morning of 7 october , amal alabadla was heavily pregnant and snuggled up in bed with 18-month-old noah when they were woken by a wall of sound . hamas had launched its attack on israel , firing thousands of rockets over the border . israeli jet fighters launched retaliatory attacks soon after . in khan younis , amal had no idea what was going on . she was anxious and terrified and , eight months pregnant , she started bleeding heavily . she had to get to hospital but her husband was working outside gaza , in the occupied west bank , and she was alone . after a three-hour wait , the first taxi driver could only take her part of the way . the streets were full of people who didn't know what to do or where to go . all the time , she was bleeding . when amal , an architect , got to the hospital she was sent for a caesarean section immediately . mohamed was born into a world irrevocably changed . since then his mother has been in a daily battle to keep him and his two-year-old brother alive . as with 90 % of people in gaza , amal and her family haven't had a healthy , balanced diet in months . the problem is particularly acute in the north , where 90 % of children and 95 % of pregnant and breastfeeding women face severe food shortages . earlier this month the world health organization said children were dying of starvation in northern gaza after visiting hospitals there . but even in the south finding baby formula is a struggle . in many of the emergencies the un responds to , the rate of breastfeeding is high . but in gaza , as in the uk , only about half of women breastfeed beyond six weeks . "" as soon as the conflict started we knew this was going to be a challenge , "" says anu nayaran , unicef's senior adviser on child nutrition in emergencies . "" if you are not breastfeeding your child , you're in the middle of a conflict , you are not going to suddenly be able to start feeding your infant , "" she says . "" you are wholly reliant on baby formula . "" amal managed to breastfeed mohamed for a month but then found she wasn't producing enough milk . "" i was afraid and nervous all the time . i wasn't focusing on good food for me . so i didn't have milk for him , "" she says . "" but i tried . "" as the war progressed it got harder . gaza's water system is barely functioning . most new mothers are dehydrated , which hampers their ability to produce milk . "" people are getting less than two litres of water a day and that's barely enough to drink , let alone wash , "" says ms nayaran . not enough baby formula is getting into gaza . there is little left on the market . although the un has responded by sending it in as aid , the number of trucks entering gaza is much lower than before the outbreak of war . meanwhile the fighting and the breakdown of social order mean convoys inside gaza have been attacked and looted . israel denies impeding the entry of aid to gaza and blames aid agencies on the ground for failing to distribute what does get in . but on friday australian foreign minister penny wong said there were large stocks of food waiting to go in to gaza , "" but there is no way to move it across the border into gaza and deliver it at scale without israel's co-operation , and we implore israel to allow more aid into gaza now "" . because of the lack of clean water , unicef is sending pre-mixed baby formula to gaza . it is safer to use but harder to transport in large quantities . three days into recovery from her c-section , amal was displaced for the first time , forced to evacuate her mother's home . the fourth time they were displaced they left in the night , two hours before the place was bombed . "" i couldn't take the milk and diapers with me because they destroyed the whole building to the ground , "" she said . amal initially took her children to rafah , thinking it would be safer , but returned to the khan younis area . she couldn't find the things she needed in rafah . mohamed has a dairy allergy ; ordinary formula makes him sick . she found one tub of non-dairy formula but it was $ 40 ( £ 31 ) , ten times the price before the war . by mid-january the family were living on a patch of scrubland outside khan younis and amal had only two days of baby formula left . at three months old , mohamed could eat nothing else . "" i'll dig the mountains to provide it , "" she texted . "" my baby needs it . "" she sent her brothers to search in the rubble of buildings but they came back empty-handed . she decided to go to rafah to search the shops and markets again . that journey would usually take just 20 minutes by car , but israeli forces were now active on the route . on the way they encountered three tanks ; one fired in their direction with the shot landing near the car . the driver reversed and they escaped . panicked and desperate to get back to her children , she didn't manage to find any formula . fighting in khan younis intensified in february and the noise from the explosions was especially difficult for noah . he has epilepsy and the bombing makes his seizures worse . his epilepsy medication has run out and amal can't find it anywhere . the family have little food and less water . amal has been boiling it over the fire to try to get it clean . "" it's still dirty but i'm doing my best , "" she said . about 24,000 children have been born since the beginning of this war , according to estimates by the who . gaza's entire population is facing crisis levels of hunger but the risk is especially acute for young children . "" children can get sick very fast , "" says anu nayaran at unicef . they have fewer stores of fat and muscle and can slip quickly into acute malnutrition . "" even when they are treated there are long-term consequences . malnutrition can lead to higher rates of diabetes , heart disease and even obesity in later life . a study of adults in the democratic republic of congo , who were treated for severe acute malnutrition as children , found it had a long-term effect on their cognitive development , negatively affecting educational achievement and self-esteem . amal has given up on finding formula for now . but mohamed would not go hungry , yet . she found a mother in the same area who is breastfeeding him alongside her own baby . amal was paying her with some baby clothes and a little money . they were camping on a patch of sand in the coastal area of al-mawasi in tents made from planks and rubber sheets , eating canned food and bread from donated flour if they could get it and cooking with foraged wood . al-mawasi had been designated as a "" humanitarian area "" by the israeli military earlier on in the war . even that set-up would not last long . last sunday they were displaced yet again when their camp came under attack . the tent next to amal's was shelled and four people were killed . "" it's a miracle we are alive , "" she texted . like many other gazans she has now resorted to online crowdfunding to try to raise the thousands of dollars her family will need to pay brokers to get on a list of people approved to leave gaza for egypt and safety . one evening amal sent the last picture she took of her life before the war , dated the night of 6 october . noah was lying on the soft carpet , propped up on a big cushion , watching cartoons on tv and swigging milk from his bottle . he's kicking his legs in the air under the soft glow of fairy lights on the living room wall . he fell asleep tucked up with his mother that night in a world far away from the dust , dirt and brutality that mark their life now .

2024-03-16T08:03:40.000Z,BBC,"since the start of the israel-gaza war , following the hamas attack of 7 october , the overriding fear has been that the conflict could spill over into something even deadlier . the day after the hamas assault , lebanon's most powerful armed group hezbollah fired guided rockets and shells into israel in solidarity with hamas , prompting israeli drone and artillery retaliation . could israel , traumatised and vulnerable , with a prime minister fighting for political survival , decide the threat from across its northern border in lebanon needs to be neutralised ? the fear has been that benjamin netanyahu's government might be tempted into a second front in the war , against hezbollah - which , like hamas , is intent on destroying the jewish state . and if so , would it draw in iran , hezbollah's key patron in the region and sworn enemy of the us ? this week israel carried out more air strikes on the bekaa valley , deep into lebanon , taking the death toll in lebanon since the start of the conflict to more than 240 . in retaliation , hezbollah fired a barrage of 100 katyusha rockets on northern israel , its heaviest attack since the war began , with targets including israeli army bases in the golan heights . at least 17 israelis have been killed in attacks from lebanon and syria since october . the rockets this week prompted an angry post by israel's far-right national security minister itamar ben-gvir , addressed to the defence minister yoav gallant : "" the military is your responsibility . what are you waiting for ? we have to start responding , attacking - war , now ! "" last month , chief of staff of the israel defence forces ( idf ) herzi halevi said : "" we are now focusing on being prepared for war in the north . "" for long , it seemed that the clashes on the border were carefully calibrated around unspoken red lines to avoid escalation into all-out war . hassan nasrallah , the leader of hezbollah , has not called for it . memories in lebanon are still fresh of the disastrous 2006 war with israel , which left more than 1,000 lebanese dead . and israel knows that hezbollah's military capability is far greater than that of hamas . a poll published in the country's maariv newspaper last month showed that 71 % of respondents favoured a large-scale military operation to drive hezbollah back . sarit zehavi lives close to the lebanese border and heads the alma research centre , which specialises on the threat there . she says hezbollah's aim is "" to drag israel into war without actually initiating it "" . but , she argues , israel is not looking for all-out confrontation . "" israel's interest is to avoid full scale war - but achieve an improved security situation , while damaging hezbollah's brigades as much as possible . for israel , it is about choosing the least worst option : we understand the capability of hezbollah here and the cost of war . "" she believes that hezbollah's use of rockets , which have a longer range than anti-tank missiles used previously by the group , is evidence of a shift in the group's military tactics and capability . "" hezbollah takes into consideration the cost of a war , but they don't look into the near future - they look years ahead . "" "" they have already gained by forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of israelis , "" she adds - about 60,000 israelis living in communities close to the border have fled the fighting since october , the largest such displacement in israeli history . around 100,000 lebanese residents have also been moved from the other side of the border . to allow for the evacuees to return , israel wants to push hezbollah's forces back beyond the litani river , which marks a buffer zone of sorts between beirut and the israeli border . as part of the agreement to end the 2006 war , the area south of the litani was supposed to be clear of military presence except for that of the lebanese army and un forces - which hezbollah has violated . that's been part of discussions with amos hochstein , the us special envoy , who has been repeatedly dispatched to the region to avert an escalation . but a deal on hezbollah's withdrawal and disarmament remains elusive . so far , both benjamin netanyahu and hezbollah appear to be holding back from the precipice . the israeli army is already stretched in gaza , without opening a new front - and a new wave of international tension . and hezbollah is in reactive mode , opting more for a lower-level war of attrition . but the real risk is miscalculation , and caving into competing pressures . mr netanyahu is battered by the perception that he left his country vulnerable to the worst attack in its history , reviled by families of the hostages who want him to strike a deal to bring them back , and excoriated by the west over the mounting civilian casualties in gaza . the fear is that he may see expanding the fight in lebanon as key to his political survival - and that israel , in the wake of the 7 october attacks , would not countenance the continued threat on its northern front without taking military action . professor hilal khashan , from the american university in beirut , believes israel's relative restraint so far doesn't tell the true story . "" netanyahu clearly wants war , "" he says , pointing to israel's strikes on about 4,000 positions across lebanon since october . "" he is finished politically and when the war stops , he will have to face his reckoning , "" he says . "" i don't think he'll give a damn about what the us or europe will think - he has made up his mind on hezbollah . "" a further , and potentially more serious , unknown would be the response from iran , which relies on hezbollah , its proxy in lebanon , as a bulwark against israel . since the hamas attack , tehran has flexed its muscles across the middle east . iran-backed groups have hit us military bases in iraq and syria , and yemen's houthi rebels , aligned with iran , have launched countless strikes on ships in the red sea . it has so far stopped short of an unfettered war . but major israeli strikes on hezbollah could change tehran's calculus . in lebanon , there is little appetite for full conflict with israel , particularly among religious groups that don't belong to the shia branch of islam to which hezbollah belongs . "" non-shias are almost unanimously opposed , and want hezbollah to disarm , "" says professor khashan . but shias are unhappy about the fighting too , he says . "" by and large , they don't want war either . "" hassan nasrallah has said that he will not agree to a ceasefire with israel before there is a truce in gaza . he is reported to have told an iranian military leader last month that he did not want iran to get sucked into a war with israel or the united states - and that in the case of a full offensive with israel , hezbollah would fight on its own . still fear stalks those living on either side of a perilous border . "" every night , i take the images of 7 october massacre with me to bed , "" says sarit zehavi , "" and every morning i wake and say ' ok , the terrorists didn't invade again last night ' . it's an existential threat in the deepest possible way .

"" there is a danger that a full-scale offensive in rafah will result in many terrible civilian casualties , which must be avoided at all costs , "" mr scholz said . it comes after israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu approved plans for a military operation in rafah , adding that the army was preparing for the evacuation of civilians . defending its strategy , israel says hamas cannot be fully removed in gaza without targeting rafah . israel's plans have been criticised by the international community , with the un and us also warning that a full-scale assault in rafah could be disastrous . speaking on thursday , the israel defense forces ( idf ) said it planned to move displaced palestinians in gaza to what it called "" humanitarian islands "" in the middle of the strip . it is not clear what the "" islands "" will look like , or how they will operate . a population plagued by deprivation , gazans are in desperate need of food with the united nations previously warning that the enclave is on the brink of famine . cogat , the israeli body that coordinates humanitarian aid to gaza , says that so far this month an average of 126 food trucks have entered each day . it says this is more than the 70 trucks carrying food specifically that entered gaza before the war . some 500 trucks in total entered gaza each day before the war . getting aid in by land is most effective . but military operations and the breakdown of social order have severely hampered aid distribution , leading some countries to try alternative routes - by air and sea . israel denies impeding the entry of aid to gaza and accuses aid organisations of failing to distribute it . meanwhile , israel and hamas could meet in doha for talks on a potential truce deal as soon as sunday . hamas said it had given a "" comprehensive vision "" to mediators . but mr netanyahu accused the group of making "" unrealistic "" demands . nevertheless , he agreed to send israeli negotiators to qatar . in an interview with the bbc on saturday , dr margaret harris , spokeswoman for the world health organization ( who ) , said it is "" good news "" to hear there is movement towards a ceasefire . she described that measure as "" the only answer "" to the current situation in gaza . dr harris said her colleagues on the ground have never seen misery like it .

"" the second sent immediately afterwards read : "" i'm sorry . "" she called - no answer . "" it rang and rang , "" she says . "" i wrote ' are you okay ? let me know you are okay . ' none of those ( messages ) were ever seen . my throat clenched and my stomach curled up . i just knew something horrible was unfolding , and i knew he knew . "" hersh was caught up in the carnage unleashed by hamas at the supernova music festival . he sought refuge in a packed bomb shelter . hamas militants were just outside , throwing in hand grenades . the last image of the 23-year-old is in a hamas video . he is being loaded on to a pickup truck , surrounded by gunmen . his left arm has been blown off . the hamas attacks killed around 1,200 israelis , most of them civilians . since then , israel has bombed gaza relentlessly , killing more than 31,000 people according to officials in the hamas-run territory . 70 % of the dead there are women and children . while the war rages in gaza , rachel's battle is to bring home her son , and the other hostages . hersh is among 130 hostages from the 7 october attacks remaining in gaza . israel believes at least 30 of them are already dead . "" every morning i make a concerted effort and say to myself , ' now , pretend to be human so that i can get up and try to save hersh and the other remaining hostages ' , "" she tells me . "" what i want to do is lay in a ball on the floor weeping , but that won't help them . "" rachel - a mother of three - is small and slight but she is a powerhouse . we meet at her family's campaign headquarters - the office of a venture capital company , lent by a friend . campaigning is now her full-time job . she hasn't been back to work since the day of the attacks . neither has her husband jon . but five months on , the focus on the hostages is fading - at home and abroad . relatives are having to fight hard to keep them in the public eye . ask about her hersh , and a smile lights up her face . "" that's my favourite subject - my children , "" she says . "" hersh is a happy-go-lucky , laid-back soccer fan . he's wild about music festivals and he has been obsessed with geography and travel since he's been a little boy . "" her son , who is an american-israeli dual citizen , was due to leave for a round-the-world trip lasting a year or two . his ticket was already bought . the departure date was 27 december . hopes were raised of a deal to get the hostages back before the muslim holy month of ramadan - in return for a ceasefire of about 40 days and the release of palestinian prisoners . a bleak ramadan has come , without a breakthrough . but talks on a possible agreement are due to resume in doha in the next day or so . rachel says she is always worried , scared , and doubtful - "" you know the saying , don't count your chickens before they hatch ? i feel like don't count your hostage until you're hugging them . "" but hope , she says , "" is mandatory "" . "" i believe it and i have to believe it , that he will come back to us . "" in the midst of her torment , she is quick to acknowledge the pain of families in gaza . she says the agony must end , and not only for israelis . "" there are thousands and thousands of innocent civilians in gaza who are suffering , "" she says . "" there is so much suffering to go around . and i would love for our leaders , all of them , to say , ' we're going to do what we have to do so that just the normal people can stop suffering ' . "" experts say it's not just the hostage families who are trapped in an anguishing wait . it's also the 105 hostages who were freed in november during a week-long truce , leaving others behind . "" many of them keep telling us that they can't even start grieving or healing until their friends or family members will be back , "" says professor ofrit shapira-berman , a veteran psychoanalyst , and specialist in treating complex trauma . "" many still have a relative in gaza , "" she tells us . "" others have friends they made during captivity . everyone is waiting . that's one thing they have in common . their trauma is being delayed . "" on the morning of 7 october , professor shapira-berman was already mobilising a volunteer network of physicians and mental health experts to provide support for survivors . since november , they have also been treating returned hostages . in her book-filled office in a suburb of tel aviv she gives us a painstaking account of what the hostages endured . all were psychologically abused , she says , but not all were physically abused . "" some of them were beaten , "" she says , "" including the children . they were all given a very little amount of food , almost on the edge of starvation , very little water and sometimes water which was dirty . they were drugged . they were forced to take ketamine ( used for anaesthesia ) . they were touched without consent , the whole variety , "" she says , her voice trailing away . there is particular concern in israel for the women being held - with reason , she says . "" what emerged is very clear evidence and testimony that some of the women are being sexually abused , "" she tells us , "" not have been but are still being sexually abused "" . she is measured about what the future may hold for those who have been freed . at least some of them "" will be able to love and to trust someone "" , she says , but it may take years . she warns that healing will be more difficult for those who were physically abused or came back to discover loved ones had been slaughtered and their home destroyed . for those who remain in gaza , five months on , she tells us , recovery is far less certain , even if they are ultimately freed . and if they are not released , what does that mean for the hostages who have returned ? "" well , apparently your heart can break into endless pieces , "" prof shapira-berman replies . "" so even though it's broken already , it will be broken again . it's like beyond my imagination that there will be no ceasefire . even and when the hostages are back , this is our modern holocaust . "" family photos of itai svirsky show a dark-haired man with smiling eyes and full cheeks . in one picture , the 38-year-old is strumming a guitar . in another he sits on a bench with his arm around his grandmother , aviva . in a propaganda video released by hamas in january , there is a very different itai - with sunken cheeks , bleary eyes , and a low voice . he won't be coming home . all his family can hope for is to get his body back from gaza for burial . they say itai was killed by his guard - after an idf air strike nearby - based on an investigation by the army . "" itai was executed two days after by the terrorist that guarded him , "" says his cousin , naama weinberg . "" we know he shot him . what would bring that man to shoot him after 99 days ? it's devastating . the disappointment is unimaginable . "" the army has denied hamas claims that svirsky was killed in the air strike , though it admits another hostage held with him probably was . we first met naama last november when she was campaigning for itai's release , and still had hope . despite her loss she's still campaigning - for the other hostages - though she is now wrapped in grief . we caught up with her on a recent march by the hostage families from tel aviv to jerusalem . "" i'm angry and i am sad because itai will not come back anymore , "" she says . "" they ( the government ) did not do whatever they can , and they are still not doing whatever they can . obviously , hamas is not the best partner to negotiate with , but we want them back , and we want them back alive . "" naama is pained by what itai went through in his final months - witnessing the killing of his mother , orit - a peace activist - on 7 october , and then languishing in captivity . and she's pained by a sense that israel is getting used to the hostage crisis . "" i'm very worried about it , "" she tells me . "" i am worried about the nature of humankind to accept situations . i am disappointed from israeli society . i am disappointed from the whole world that is sitting quiet and letting this happen . "" then she leaves us to rejoin the marchers on the road to jerusalem . days later , relatives gather on the roadway at dusk - forming a tight circle of loss - and bringing traffic to a standstill outside israel's defence ministry in tel aviv . most carry posters with photos of sons , or daughters , or parents they have not seen or held since 7 october , when hamas dragged them into gaza . then comes a sombre count ( in hebrew ) "" one , two , three "" and onwards - a tally of the number of days their loved ones have been gone . that number is now 163 ( as of 17 march ) . each word from the loudhailer resounds like an accusation directed at israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu . signs read "" deal refusal = hostages ' death sentence "" . among the protesters we meet amit shem tov , who wants his brother omer back . he was taken from the music festival like hersh goldberg-polin . "" as beautiful as he is from the outside , he is more beautiful from the inside , "" amit says , smiling at his brother's bearded face in the poster by his side , "" such a personality , too many friends , always making jokes , always laughs , always loves to dance , to live life . that's him "" . then the counting comes to an end , the few dozen protesters clear the road , and the traffic moves on - something the families of the hostages cannot do . "" for us , it's still 7 october , "" says amit . additional reporting by wietske burema",dutch court orders halt to f-35 jet parts exports to israel
2024-03-17T06:34:48.031Z,BBC,"women from different religions have said that singing together in a choir has helped them gain new perspectives and “ create bonds ” . trubys abrahamic women's choir has 30 members and performs songs from judaism , islam and christianity.the group will appear at an interfaith ramadan event , the great get together iftar , on sunday in milton keynes . the choir's founder , kurshida mizra , said the group had also helped members to work through “ the terrible , emotional "" period surrounding the israel-gaza conflict . "" we’ve sat in a room together and managed to find words to talk about it , without ever feeling that we’re not loved by each other . “ it’s been much easier than you think because we came together accepting there is so much that unites us . "" we’re going through a terrible emotional time . . . but our group brings together women from these three different faiths , "" ms mirza said . ms mirza , who also set up the interfaith café trubys garden tearoom in milton keynes , said she was inspired by early memories of attending islamic mawlid gatherings . “ i remember enjoying them very much and i learned a lot from the act of singing . “ in all of our religions there is a rich tradition of recitation and singing . if you recite the quran , it’s very melodic , ” she said.the choir was initially funded to create a sound piece exploring women's spiritual experiences . "" our voices are not heard in the faith setting , it’s a very male-dominated perspective , "" said ms mirza.after the funding ended , the members wanted to continue the choir . “ they found it made them happy , they bonded , learned from each other’s perspectives . it created a lot of friendships . ” gill barstow , 65 , said she “ absolutely loves singing ” . she attends the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints and was “ always very keen to find out about other religions and create unity ” . ms barstow said that at first , “ it may seem the person is quite different – they have different practices or ways of worshipping ” . “ but when you get under the surface , there is so much more that connects people of faith than difference . it's uplifting to meet another person who worships the same god i do , but in a different way , ” she added.ms barstow said she was “ quite proud ” of herself for managing to sing in hebrew and arabic.she described “ a sort of energy and cooperation ” in the choir , as well as a spiritual connection . “ i often feel the spirit very strongly when i sing – sometimes i'm half way through a song and i feel like crying . a lot of songs are like poems and prayers really , ” she said . asma moustaoui , 33 , said belonging to the choir was “ mentally , physically and spiritually beneficial ” . “ it’s a breather to sit with women who share the same values and purpose , ” she said.growing up as a muslim in morocco , singing was the norm . “ i grew up singing burda and in women’s groups . i was a professional quran reciter . it was a form of spiritual connectivity – with family , faith and women . ” but after moving to the uk , ms moustaoui said she felt “ isolated ” from that heritage , and started to "" lose connection ” with her faith.so the women’s choir was “ ideal ” , and with her degree in linguistics , she has been able to translate and teach members how to sing in other languages . “ it's beautiful to see how many words are similar in the different languages . i've never sung in english before this . “ you learn from the others , you learn new ways to sing a song that you’ve done your whole life . people bring a different spirit to it , ” she said . lynda gilbert , 68 , said the choir had helped her to “ hang onto hope ” in the face of the conflict in the middle east.ms gilbert , who is a member of the milton keynes and district reform synagogue , said it was “ really important for jewish women to stand alongside christian and muslim women and sing together for peace ” . “ if we can come together and sing together , then it’s possible in the middle east too . we can keep hold of that dream and it keeps us from feeling despair . ” she said that while some “ divisiveness ” had spilled over into british society , “ in groups like ours we’re pushing back against that "" .

2024-03-17T13:48:32.000Z,BBC,"israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu has reaffirmed his determination to launch an offensive in rafah , defying international criticism . the city is crammed with some 1.5 million palestinians from other parts of gaza seeking refuge . his comments come as the german chancellor , on a middle east trip , restated his opposition to the plan . but mr netanyahu said "" no international pressure will stop israel "" from achieving all of its war aims . "" if we stop the war now before achieving all of its goals , the meaning is that israel had lost the war and we will not allow this , "" mr netanyahu told a meeting of his cabinet . he said israel must be able to continue its war , with the aims of eliminating hamas , releasing all hostages and ensuring gaza "" no longer poses a threat "" . "" to do this , we will also operate in rafah . "" mr netanyahu said the offensive in city at the southern tip of the gaza strip "" will happen "" and will take "" several weeks "" . he also lashed out at his critics , saying to them : "" is your memory so short ? "" so quickly you forgot about [ 7 october ] , the worst massacre committed against jews since the holocaust . "" those attacks , in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage from israel , sparked the current war . the hamas-run health ministry in gaza says more than 31,400 have been killed . the israeli leader met german chancellor olaf scholz on sunday . speaking to reporters in a joint news conference mr scholz said he spoke to mr netanyahu about the need to provide those in gaza with "" comprehensive humanitarian aid supplies "" . he stressed that conditions for aid distribution "" must be urgently and massively improved "" . he said a hostage deal for israelis taken by hamas on 7 october was necessary alongside a longer-lasting ceasefire in gaza . the german leader said he told his israeli counterpart a "" humanitarian logic "" should be considered ahead of a ground offensive in rafah . to which mr netanyahu said : "" [ israel's ] goal in eliminating the remaining terrorist battalions in rafah goes hand in hand with enabling the civilian population to leave rafah "" . "" it's not something that we will do , while keeping the population locked in place , "" the israeli leader added . israel's plans have been heavily criticised by the international community , with the un and us also warning that a full-scale assault in rafah could be disastrous . tedros adhanom ghebreyesus , the head of the un's world health organization , on friday appealed to israel "" in the name of humanity "" not to launch such an attack on gaza's southern-most city . the us says it has not yet seen a detailed israeli plan for rafah , and president joe biden has warned israel against expanding its invasion in the city , calling it a "" red line "" . the relationship between israel and the us is becoming ever more fractious . but israel's prime minister believes he still has the pro-israel american lobby behind him . the risk , though , is that as the us election draws closer , the biden administration could decide to placate americans frustrated by its support for israel , and begin to limit military aid . nevertheless , mr netanyahu's office approved plans for a military operation in rafah on friday , adding that the army was preparing for the evacuation of civilians . the israel defense forces ( idf ) said it planned to move displaced palestinians in gaza to what it called "" humanitarian islands "" in the middle of the strip . it is not clear what the "" islands "" will look like , or how they will operate . moving an estimated 1.4 million gazans from rafah would take time - and troops , and israel's military is already stretched in combat and aid distribution . doing so would require finding places of safety in the wasteland of gaza , and providing food and water , so it could still take time for an offensive there to start - if it does at all . speaking in jordan earlier , mr scholz referenced the need for a truce "" that lasts longer "" . ceasefire talks were expected to resume in qatar in the coming days . israel had planned to send a delegation to join the negotiations , but ministers were yet to agree on its mandate . israel has faced mounting criticism for the number of civilian casualties in gaza , as well as shortages of aid that have fuelled fears of famine . on thursday , us senate majority leader chuck schumer called for israel to hold elections to replace mr netanyahu . the prime minister slammed the comments as "" totally inappropriate "" , and said they should be working instead to bring down the "" hamas tyranny "" . this appears to be vintage benjamin netanyahu : hitting back at critics and digging in amidst mounting pressure at home and abroad . he is increasingly hemmed in : chided by members of his own government ; increasingly reviled by families of the hostages ; and excoriated by western allies who have run out of patience . the israeli prime minister appears determined to pursue the war , pushed by his more bellicose far-right ministers , and believes that despite all the criticism here , a traumatised israel still backs the offensive in gaza . most israelis do still support an offensive to crush hamas , albeit while also getting the hostages back . but it's also possible that he's talking tough on rafah to up the pressure on hamas before the new ceasefire talks in doha , to which israel will send a delegation . and he knows that when eventually the war ends , so could his political career .",adviser warns london a ' no-go zone for jews every weekend '
2024-03-18T01:59:40.000Z,BBC,"the israeli military says it has taken control of al-shifa hospital in gaza city in what it called an operation to "" thwart terrorist activity "" . it said troops killed 20 "" terrorists "" , including a senior commander of hamas's internal security force , and detained dozens of suspects during the raid . witnesses described heavy exchanges of fire around the site , where thousands of displaced people are sheltering . gaza's hamas-run health ministry said israel was committing a war crime . the israeli military said there was no obligation for medical staff or patients to leave , and that the hospital could continue its important functions . but several medical staff inside the hospital told the bbc that the electricity had been cut and that they had been instructed by the israeli military not to move , prohibiting them from properly treating patients . "" we are trapped where we are inside the department , "" said dr amer jedbeh , a 31-year-old surgical resident .

"" we know that senior hamas terrorists have regrouped inside al-shifa hospital and are using it to command attacks against israel , "" he said . he added : "" we call upon all hamas terrorists hiding in hospitals to surrender immediately . medical facilities should never be exploited for terror . hamas must be held accountable . "" hamas and health officials have repeatedly denied the accusation that hamas fighters have operated inside or underneath al-shifa and other hospitals . later on monday , the idf said in a statement that troops had "" identified terrorist fire toward them from a number of hospital buildings "" , adding : "" the forces engaged the terrorists and identified several hits . "" it also released grainy night-time video footage from drones and an armoured vehicle that it said showed troops coming under fire from within the compound and the detonation of an explosive device . in the afternoon , the idf announced : "" twenty terrorists have been eliminated at al-shifa hospital thus far in various engagements , and dozens of apprehended suspects are currently in questioning . "" it said among those killed was the head of the operations directorate of hamas ' internal security service , faiq al-mabhouh , adding that he had been "" hiding in a compound . . . from which he operated and advanced terrorist activity "" . the hamas-run government's media office said faiq al-mabhouh had been in charge of co-ordinating deliveries to northern gaza with local clans and the un . qatar-based broadcaster al jazeera meanwhile reported that israeli forces had beaten and arrested its correspondent ismail al-ghoul during the raid . there was no immediate comment from the idf . the idf also said an israeli soldier , staff sgt matan vingradov , had been killed in northern gaza on monday , but did not say whether it happened at al-shifa . the hamas-run health ministry said in a statement that israeli forces had "" invaded "" al-shifa hospital for the fourth time since start of the war and was using "" fabricated narratives "" to justify its actions . it accused the troops of "" directly shooting the specialised surgeries building with bullets and targeting it with missiles "" , and said a number of people had been killed and wounded .

2024-03-18T17:13:50.000Z,BBC,"when dawn broke last monday morning , signalling the beginning of ramadan , it brought a cruel irony for the people of gaza . the holy month when muslims fast during daylight had arrived amid a looming famine . gazans had already endured five months of war . virtually the entire population was already dependent on food aid to survive . "" the people here have already been fasting for months , "" said dr amjad eleiwa , the deputy director of the emergency department at al-shifa hospital , gaza city . "" they scour the city looking for food to survive , but they cannot find any . "" israel's bombardment of gaza , in response to the hamas attacks of 7 october , has destroyed food infrastructure and farmland across the territory . aid agencies say enhanced israeli security checks on delivery trucks have created bottlenecks around aid reaching the population . the global body responsible for declaring famine , the integrated food security phase classification ( ipc ) , reported this monday that 1.1 million people - virtually half the population of gaza - was already starving and the rest of the people there could be in a famine by july . the food crisis is most acute in northern gaza . unlike previous ramadans , residents there cannot rely this year on lining their stomachs with suhoor , the pre-dawn breakfast , nor look forward to assuaging their hunger with iftar , the post-sunset meal . street decorations , drummers and stalls loaded with treats have been replaced by destruction , death and a daily fight to find food . prices for what little flour or wheat is available have risen five-fold . "" i remember the last ramadan , there was good food - juices , dates , milk , everything you could want , "" said nadia abu nahel , a 57-year-old mother caring for an extended family of 10 children in gaza city . "" compared to this year , it is like heaven and hell , "" she said . "" the children now are craving a loaf of bread , it is a meal they dream of . their bones are becoming softer . they are dizzy , they struggle to walk . they are becoming very thin . "" according to the poverty charity care , at least 27 people - 23 of them children - have died from malnutrition or dehydration in northern gaza in recent weeks . the real number , according to doctors from several northern hospitals , is likely to be higher . among those treated for malnutrition by dr eleiwa at al-shifa hospital recently was a boy aged between 10 and 12 who died last week during ramadan ; a boy aged around four months whose mother was killed , leaving him short of milk when none was available to buy ; and an 18-year-old girl who was already suffering from epilepsy . "" she was already sick and none of her medicine was available any longer and her family had no food , "" dr eleiwa said . "" in the end her body was very meagre , just bones and skin and no fat . "" under his care at al-shifa on friday , 16-year-old rafeeq dughmoush was lying on his side , bedbound . rafeeq's bones were showing and one of his legs had been amputated from the knee down . a colostomy bag was attached to his torso . "" i am emaciated , "" he said , speaking slowly in order to draw breath between words . "" i am so weak i cannot move my body from one side to another . my uncle has to move me . "" rafeeq and his sister rafeef , 15 , were severely injured when an israeli air strike hit their home , killing 11 members of the family , their uncle mahmoud said . among the dead were their mother , four other siblings and their nieces and nephews . rafeeq was already suffering from malnutrition , he said , before the strike that wounded him . "" we could not find any kind of fruit to eat , no apple , no guava , there was no meat and any food at the markets was all too expensive , "" he said . rafeef , whose leg was shattered by the strike and pinned together , said she had asked the hospital staff for any kind of fruit or vegetable for him to eat , "" but they cannot provide any "" . ramadan used to be a time of pure joy , rafeef said , "" heaven compared to now "" . "" it really was beautiful , "" she said . "" but these times will not come back . the best people in our lives have disappeared .

"" i feel helpless to save these children and it is a hard and shameful feeling , "" dr safiya said . "" i have the same feeling for my staff , who cannot find enough food for themselves and some days do not eat . "" israel was waging a "" war by starvation , "" he said . "" intentionally depriving children of food , killing them with hunger - there is no law in the world that allows occupiers to do this . "" the eu's foreign policy chief josep borrell has also accused israel of intentionally starving gazans . "" in gaza we are no longer on the brink of famine , we are in a state of famine , "" he said on monday . "" this is unacceptable . starvation is used as a weapon of war . israel is provoking famine . "" israel denies it is intentionally starving gazans . it has blamed the un , which it says has created logistical challenges around aid deliveries , as well as hamas , which israel says has commandeered aid . the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , denied last week that gazans were starving .

2024-03-19T12:16:21.000Z,BBC,"gaza's two million people are experiencing "" severe levels of acute food insecurity "" , us secretary of state antony blinken has said . this was first time an entire population had been so classified , he said when questioned by the bbc about conditions in the territory . mr blinken called on israel to prioritise providing for those in need . un agencies have said north gaza could face famine by may without a pause in the fighting and a surge in aid . mr blinken's warning came during a trip to the philippines as us officials announced that he would travel to the middle east , his sixth trip to the region since october , as efforts to secure a ceasefire continue . israeli negotiators are due to begin talks in qatar on tuesday in a fresh attempt to agree a deal with hamas to halt the fighting , get humanitarian aid in , and israeli hostages out . the us is israel's closest ally and biggest provider of military aid . mr blinken's comments were among his strongest yet in setting out the scale of the humanitarian crisis in gaza . asked by the bbc whether the current conditions were a harbinger of the territory's future without an agreed governance or security plan , he said : "" according to the most respected measure of these things , 100 % of the population in gaza is at severe levels of acute food insecurity . that's the first time an entire population has been so classified . "" acute food insecurity is when a person's inability to consume adequate food puts their life or livelihood in immediate danger . if unaddressed , it leads to starvation . mr blinken added : "" we also see again , according to in this case the united nations , 100 % - the totality of the population - is in need of humanitarian assistance , "" he added . "" compare that to sudan , about 80 % of the population there is in need of humanitarian assistance ; afghanistan , about 70 % . so , again , this only underscores both the urgency , the imperative , of making this the priority . "" he once again called on hamas to lay down arms but said it was incumbent on israel to make it a priority to provide for those who desperately needed humanitarian assistance . asked about the numbers of journalists killed in gaza and lack of access to the territory for international reporters , mr blinken said that "" as a matter of principle "" journalists should have access wherever there is conflict so "" the world can have knowledge "" . he said the issue was something "" we bring up in every instance "" . later , the un human rights chief stressed that the catastrophic hunger in gaza was "" human-made and . . . entirely preventable "" . volker türk put the blame firmly on what he called israel's "" extensive restrictions on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid and commercial goods , displacement of most of the population , as well as the destruction of crucial civilian infrastructure "" . the restrictions , he warned , "" may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war , which is a war crime "" . israel's diplomatic mission to the un in geneva said mr türk was seeking to blame it for the situation in gaza and "" completely absolve the responsibility of the un and hamas "" . "" israel is doing everything it can to flood gaza with aid , including by land air and sea , "" it insisted . aid workers reject this , saying that much of the problem in the northern gaza is due to a collapse in security around aid convoys , after israel targeted police who were escorting them . israel has said police have been hit because its military is dismantling hamas . but the us has questioned this , saying such targeting makes aid distribution impossible and is counterproductive . meanwhile , the us state department has called on israel to permit philippe lazzarini , chief of the un's agency for palestinian refugees , entry into gaza after he was denied on monday . israel previously accused unrwa of supporting hamas , which the agency denied . but in january it sacked nine of 12 employees accused in an israeli document of playing a part in the 7 october attacks . us officials also announced on tuesday that mr blinken would make his latest trip to the region since hamas's attacks on israel on 7 october and the start of the war in gaza . it comes without a breakthrough so far on a ceasefire for hostage-release deal between israel and hamas . he will speak with saudi leaders in jeddah and then continue onto cairo to meet the egyptian leadership . a significant part of the talks will focus on arab support for a post-war plan to secure and govern gaza . the americans want rule by the palestinian authority , the post-oslo peace accords entity that lost control in gaza to hamas after elections and fighting 17 years ago . but the israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has repeatedly rejected the idea of pa rule there , one of many critical points of dispute over any so-called "" day after plan "" for gaza . mr blinken did not address a question about whether an agreed post-war plan for gaza could only move forward with a different israeli leader . on monday night , us president joe biden told mr netanyahu this his plan to push on with an offensive in rafah would be a "" mistake "" , with more than a million gazan civilians sheltering in the southern border town . in their first conversation in over a month , they also discussed a plan to send an israeli delegation to washington next week to discuss both the rafah plan and a new alternative approach to targeting hamas there without a major ground invasion .",eurovision 2024 : israel agrees to october rain lyrics change
2024-03-20T13:45:23.000Z,BBC,"millions of people in gaza are on the brink of famine as they struggle to access food . the united nations ( un ) has also warned that the ongoing conflict in sudan could trigger the world's largest hunger crisis . famine occurs when a country has such a severe food shortage that its population faces acute malnutrition , starvation , or death . the status is generally declared by the united nations ( un ) , sometimes in conjunction with the country's government , and often alongside other international aid organisations or humanitarian agencies . it is decided using a un scale called the integrated food security phase classification ( ipc ) . this ranks a country's food shortages - or insecurity - against five "" phases "" of severity , with famine the fifth and worst . for a famine to be officially declared , three things need to happen in a specific geographical area : according to the un , famine is imminent in northern gaza , and could occur any time up to may 2024 . it follows months of conflict between israel and hamas in gaza after the 7 october hamas attacks on israel . half the population - about 1.1m people - are starving , according to the ipc classification . in the worst-case scenario , the entire population of gaza will be in famine by july 2024 . the un said gaza had the "" highest share of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity that the ipc initiative has ever classified for any given area or country "" . its most senior human rights official , volker türk , told the bbc that israel bore significant blame for the crisis in gaza , and there was a "" plausible "" case that it was using starvation as a weapon of war . israel has vehemently denied this . oxfam has accused israel of "" deliberately blocking and/or undermining the international humanitarian response in the gaza strip "" . it warns that people living in gaza "" will suffer mass death from disease and starvation far beyond the current 31,000 palestinian war casualties , "" unless israel changes its approach . the un has increased pressure on israel to fulfil its legal responsibilities to protect palestinian civilians and allow adequate supplies of humanitarian aid into the region . israel insisted it was letting in all the aid offered , and accused agencies of failing to distribute it . elsewhere , un officials warned that the ongoing conflict in sudan has plunged the country into "" one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history "" , which could trigger the world's largest hunger crisis . according to the un's world food programme ( wfp ) , nearly 18 million people in sudan are facing acute food insecurity as a result of the civil war which broke out in april 2023 . unicef said it had seen malnutrition among young children "" beyond the worst projections "" , as well as outbreaks of cholera , measles and malaria . the humanitarian organisation action against hunger said several other countries also have "" very concerning levels of hunger "" . these include afghanistan , the democratic republic of congo , ethiopia , pakistan , somalia , syria and yemen . in march 2024 , the wfp warned that haiti - which is experiencing a severe political and economic crisis amidst spiralling gang violence - was "" on the edge of a devastating hunger crisis "" . about 1.4m people there are categorised as being on the verge of famine , with another three million at the level below . the ipc's description of haiti's food security situation is "" alarming "" . according to the ipc , famine and extreme food crises have multiple causes , which can be man-made , nature-driven , or a combination of both . action against hunger said conflict remains the "" key driver of hunger around the world "" . in sudan , it blamed the war for insufficient food production and resulting high prices . it also said the ongoing conflict in gaza was preventing lifesaving food , fuel and water entering the territory . the ipc highlighted humanitarian organisations ' "" near-complete lack of access "" to most of gaza . the international rescue committee ( irc ) said drought and crop failures caused by extreme weather events as a result of climate change were leading to widespread food shortages , particularly in east africa . el niño - a climate pattern that describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the pacific ocean - has already impacted food supplies in southeast asia and latin america . the declaration of famine does not unlock specific funding . however , it often triggers a large international response from other un agencies and international governments , who can provide food supplies and emergency funding . some humanitarian agencies like the irc provide malnutrition treatments . oxfam has worked with partners in gaza to distribute vouchers and cash for food and hygiene items . the wfp is working in sudan to restore infrastructure like roads and schools . it also has mobile response teams that travel to remote areas to deliver food and other assistance . many agencies typically start to plan and deliver aid before a famine has been declared in order to avoid the worst effects - usually when a country has been given a phase three classification or above . the last time famine was officially declared was in south sudan in 2017 . nearly 80,000 people faced starvation and another million were on the brink of famine after three years of civil war . at the time , the un blamed the effects of war on agriculture . farmers lost livestock , crop production was severely curtailed , and inflation soared . previous famines include southern somalia in 2011 , southern sudan in 2008 , gode in the somali region of ethiopia in 2000 , north korea in 1996 , somalia in 1991-1992 and ethiopia in 1984-1985 . between 1845 and 1852 , ireland suffered a period of starvation , disease and emigration that became known as the great famine . about one million people are thought to have died when the country's potato crop - which fed a third of the population - was destroyed by disease . food exports continued to great britain , which ruled the island of ireland at the time .",israel reined in by icj rulings on gaza - but will it obey ?

"" the relentless sounds of explosions can be heard from around al-shifa hospital , "" said osama tawfiq , who lives 700m ( 2,300ft ) from the complex . "" since monday morning , we feel like as if the war has just begun . "" according to the witnesses , the strikes targeted homes belonging to members of hamas who had been assigned to serve on so-called "" emergency committees "" in place of the armed group's police force . among them was amjad hathat , who was reportedly killed along with 11 other emergency committee members at the kuwait roundabout in gaza city on tuesday evening while securing the distribution of humanitarian aid . mr tawfiq said that the situation had deteriorated in his area , after a period of relative calm that followed the withdrawal of israeli forces in mid-january . "" we are not only enduring bombings but also facing a looming food crisis . "" "" during last ramadan , we could break our fast with some food . but now we struggle to find anything beyond water that smells like sewage and tastes like seawater , as well as meagre bread . my children are suffering from hunger . "" a un-backed food security assessment has said 1.1 million people in gaza are struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation , and that a man-made famine in the north of the territory is imminent between now and may . on wednesday morning , the israeli military said its troops had killed approximately 90 gunmen and questioned 300 suspects during what it called the "" precise operation "" in and around al-shifa . they first raided the hospital in november , when the military accused it of being a hamas "" command and control centre "" - an allegation that hamas and hospital officials denied . the military said the latest operation was launched on monday because "" senior hamas terrorists have regrouped inside . . . and are using it to command attacks against israel "" . hamas acknowledged a senior commander of its internal security force was killed there on monday , but said he was co-ordinating aid deliveries . it said the other people killed were patients and displaced civilians sheltering there . the military said it was taking measures to avoid harm to civilians and keep the hospital functioning , but witnesses told bbc arabic's gaza today programme that that the situation there was catastrophic and that civilians , including medics , were crowded in corridors .

"" israel cleared shifa once . hamas came back into shifa , which raises questions about how to ensure a sustainable campaign against hamas so that it cannot regenerate , cannot retake territory , "" the us national security adviser , jake sullivan , said this week . the us has been pressing israel to come up with a feasible alternative for hamas rule in gaza . its plan has been to promote individuals linked to the internationally recognised palestinian authority ( pa ) and to work with arab states to prevent a power vacuum . israel previously said it was seeking to cooperate with clan leaders in gaza without affiliation to the pa or hamas . now , the wall street journal has reported that israeli security officials are "" quietly developing a plan to distribute aid "" , working with palestinian leaders and businessmen not linked to hamas . the suggestion is that this "" could eventually create a palestinian-led governing authority "" . israeli media have suggested the operation at shifa hospital could last for several days . it is not being linked to the military operation in rafah which israel insists it must carry out to win the war with hamas . there has been international concern over the impact such an offensive on the egypt border could have as more than half of the 2.3m residents of gaza are now displaced there . "" it's going to happen . and it will happen even if israel is forced to fight alone , "" the israeli strategic affairs minister , ron dermer , told the call me back with dan senor podcast . while the idf has formulated operational plans for rafah and handed these to israel's government , no order has yet been given to execute them . it is seen as unlikely that such a move will take place during the islamic holy month of ramadan , which ends around 9 april . it would also take time for israel to build up the necessary forces in gaza . despite declarations to the contrary , israeli experts also believe that in order for a rafah operation to be effective , ultimately coordination will be needed with egypt and the us . "" the egyptians are on the other side of the border , "" pointed out retired general amos gilad on israel's kan radio . "" you can't do anything in rafah without coordinating with the egyptians and the americans . """,vote condemning hamas for firing rockets into israel fails at un

2024-03-22T16:38:10.000Z,BBC,"russia and china have blocked a us draft resolution put to the un which for the first time called for a ceasefire and hostage releases in gaza . while there have been previous attempts by other countries to call for a ceasefire , the us text marked a hardening of its stance towards israel . but russia and china used their veto . moscow called the text "" hypocritical "" . the move by the us , israel's key ally , comes at a time of growing tensions between them . washington has made clear that it expects israel to lessen the intensity of its offensive in gaza , where the hamas-run health ministry says at least 31,988 people - mainly women and children - have been killed since the war began on 7 october . it has also said it would not support an israeli attack on the city of rafah without a plan to protect civilians there , and has urged israel to allow more humanitarian aid into gaza . israel's prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , has said that israel will go ahead with a planned ground assault on rafah , even without the support of its key ally . the us secretary of state , antony blinken , in tel aviv for talks , said such an operation was not the answer . "" it risks killing more civilians , it risks wreaking greater havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance , it risks further isolating israel around the world and jeopardising this long-term security and standing , "" he said . the us - one of five permanent members of the security council with the power of veto - has previously blocked resolutions calling for a ceasefire , saying such a move would be wrong while delicate negotiations for a truce and hostage releases were continuing between israel and hamas . but on friday it publicly changed its position , in a carefully-worded draft . "" the security council , "" the text read , "" determines the imperative of an immediate and sustained ceasefire "" , adding "" and towards that end unequivocally supports ongoing international diplomatic efforts to secure such a ceasefire in connection with the release of all remaining hostages "" . in doing so , the us linked its support for a ceasefire to the release of the israeli hostages - 253 - held by hamas . although russia and china vetoed the draft , 11 countries on the 15-member council voted in favour of it . algeria voted against it and guyana abstained . early on saturday , a vote on a new text calling for a ceasefire was postponed until monday , diplomats told the afp and reuters news agencies . before friday's vote , russia's ambassador to the un , vassily nebenzia , criticised the text as "" exceedingly politicised "" , accusing it of doing nothing to avert israel's planned assault on rafah . more than half of gaza's 2.3 million palestinians are sheltering in the southern city , where israel says hamas leaders are hiding and hamas battalions still operate . the us ambassador to the un , linda thomas-greenfield , called russia and china's action "" deeply , deeply cynical "" . "" russia and china simply did not want to vote for a resolution that was penned by the united states , because it would rather see us fail than see this council succeed , "" she said . speaking after talks with mr netanyahu , mr blinken said the us was trying to show the international community "" a sense of urgency "" . a ceasefire tied to the release of hostages , he said , was "" something that everyone , including the countries that veto the resolution should have been able to get behind "" . french president emmanuel macron said his country would now work on an alternative resolution . "" what's important to note is that the united states has changed its position , and shown its will to defend , very clearly now , a ceasefire , "" mr macron said .

2024-03-23T03:19:08.000Z,BBC,"a security guard thrust open the door of antony blinken's armoured car and the us secretary of state strode out down a line of yellow barricades . "" we're working to get them home , "" he declared , gripping the hands of israeli protesters in tel aviv calling for a deal to release the hostages held by hamas . it was a striking moment but not altogether spontaneous . the street had by now been buzzing with security officials readying his route towards the protesters . those of us in the travelling press were told to expect the interaction in the 20 minutes or so leading up to it . it was firmly caught on camera . this was a strong message from america's top diplomat to both the israeli public and its prime minister - the us was committed , engaged and pushing everything to get a ceasefire-for-hostage-release deal over the line . in other words the message is : the us is trying to stop the war - albeit with firm conditions . washington has been under growing domestic and international pressure due to the unprecedented crisis unfolding in gaza and the catastrophically high number of civilians killed . president joe biden and mr blinken have spent weeks now publicly ramping up pressure on israel to surge more aid in , and they want to develop a plan to secure the territory's long-term future . but as the crisis deepens , the limits of american influence have become increasingly clear . just hours before the moment filmed at the barricades , the us had resorted to a vote in the un security council to try to shape the actions of its ally . this was a sign of president biden's growing exasperation . the american-drafted text called on israel to surge more aid into gaza amid un warnings of imminent famine . it endorsed the current process mediated by qatar to get a ceasefire in return for the release of hostages by hamas . but it also warned israel against a military assault on the city of rafah , home to more than 1.4 million displaced palestinians , saying an offensive could violate international humanitarian law . the resolution failed . it was vetoed by russia and china . speaking at ben gurion airport on friday afternoon , mr blinken castigated those who voted it down . he implied they did so for reasons that had nothing to do with the substance , while also warning that a rafah offensive could leave israel without international support . "" it risks killing more civilians , it risks wreaking greater havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance , it risks further isolating israel around the world and jeopardising its long term security and standing , "" he said . amid the growing rift between washington and the israeli leader , mr netanyahu struck back at mr blinken's assessment . "" i told him i hope we'll do it with the support of the united states , "" said the prime minister , "" but if we have to , we'll do it alone "" . this was a superpower being pushed back , despite its pressure . i've seen the phenomenal force of us diplomacy at close quarters this week , trailing mr blinken on a time-zone shattering tour of europe , asia and ending in the middle east trying to stem the current crisis . to america's critics the paradox is clear : the us is sending weapons to a key ally , while at the same time urging it , without success , to do much more to alleviate the civilian suffering the military action has unleashed . a un-backed food security assessment this week said 1.1 million people in gaza were struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation , adding that a man-made famine in the north was imminent between now and may . a growing number of us politicians have also spoken out . this week a group of democratic senators and nearly 70 former us officials , diplomats and military officers said president biden should consider cutting weapons supplies to israel if it keeps restricting humanitarian aid to gaza . israel blames the un for a failure to distribute supplies . the un categorically rejects this but israel insists that checkpoint restrictions and attacks on police securing aid convoys have been a necessary part of its campaign to eliminate hamas . i asked mr blinken in manilla whether the security vacuum in gaza was a harbinger of its future . how could he convince israel to accept the his proposals ? hamas could end the suffering tomorrow , he said , if it surrendered . but he reiterated that more humanitarian aid had to be allowed in . answering my question , he gave a us endorsement for the first time to a un-backed measure on hunger , saying "" 100 % of the population in gaza is at severe levels of acute food insecurity . that's the first time an entire population has been so classified .

"" we're working to get them home , "" he declared , gripping the hands of israeli protesters in tel aviv calling for a deal to release the hostages held by hamas . it was a striking moment but not altogether spontaneous . the street had by now been buzzing with security officials readying his route towards the protesters . those of us in the travelling press were told to expect the interaction in the 20 minutes or so leading up to it . it was firmly caught on camera . this was a strong message from america's top diplomat to both the israeli public and its prime minister - the us was committed , engaged and pushing everything to get a ceasefire-for-hostage-release deal over the line . in other words the message is : the us is trying to stop the war - albeit with firm conditions . washington has been under growing domestic and international pressure due to the unprecedented crisis unfolding in gaza and the catastrophically high number of civilians killed . president joe biden and mr blinken have spent weeks now publicly ramping up pressure on israel to surge more aid in , and they want to develop a plan to secure the territory's long-term future . but as the crisis deepens , the limits of american influence have become increasingly clear . just hours before the moment filmed at the barricades , the us had resorted to a vote in the un security council to try to shape the actions of its ally . this was a sign of president biden's growing exasperation . the american-drafted text called on israel to surge more aid into gaza amid un warnings of imminent famine . it endorsed the current process mediated by qatar to get a ceasefire in return for the release of hostages by hamas . but it also warned israel against a military assault on the city of rafah , home to more than 1.4 million displaced palestinians , saying an offensive could violate international humanitarian law . the resolution failed . it was vetoed by russia and china . speaking at ben gurion airport on friday afternoon , mr blinken castigated those who voted it down . he implied they did so for reasons that had nothing to do with the substance , while also warning that a rafah offensive could leave israel without international support . "" it risks killing more civilians , it risks wreaking greater havoc with the provision of humanitarian assistance , it risks further isolating israel around the world and jeopardising its long term security and standing , "" he said . amid the growing rift between washington and the israeli leader , mr netanyahu struck back at mr blinken's assessment . "" i told him i hope we'll do it with the support of the united states , "" said the prime minister , "" but if we have to , we'll do it alone "" . this was a superpower being pushed back , despite its pressure . i've seen the phenomenal force of us diplomacy at close quarters this week , trailing mr blinken on a time-zone shattering tour of europe , asia and ending in the middle east trying to stem the current crisis . to america's critics the paradox is clear : the us is sending weapons to a key ally , while at the same time urging it , without success , to do much more to alleviate the civilian suffering the military action has unleashed . a un-backed food security assessment this week said 1.1 million people in gaza were struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation , adding that a man-made famine in the north was imminent between now and may . a growing number of us politicians have also spoken out . this week a group of democratic senators and nearly 70 former us officials , diplomats and military officers said president biden should consider cutting weapons supplies to israel if it keeps restricting humanitarian aid to gaza . israel blames the un for a failure to distribute supplies . the un categorically rejects this but israel insists that checkpoint restrictions and attacks on police securing aid convoys have been a necessary part of its campaign to eliminate hamas . i asked mr blinken in manilla whether the security vacuum in gaza was a harbinger of its future . how could he convince israel to accept the his proposals ? hamas could end the suffering tomorrow , he said , if it surrendered . but he reiterated that more humanitarian aid had to be allowed in . answering my question , he gave a us endorsement for the first time to a un-backed measure on hunger , saying "" 100 % of the population in gaza is at severe levels of acute food insecurity . that's the first time an entire population has been so classified . "" much of mr blinken's trip was crisis management . trying to get aid into gaza , get the hostages out and secure an end to the conflict , which the us says must ensure hamas's attack on israel on 7 october "" can never happen again "" . at the same time it is trying to shape a post-war future . washington wants the palestinian authority running gaza . it is the entity formed during the 1990s oslo accords and driven out of gaza by hamas in 2007 . the americans think they can patch together a grand bargain for the middle east . they want to pursue the long sought-after independent state for palestinians in the west bank , east jerusalem and gaza - albeit demilitarised - alongside a secure israel : the so-called two-state solution . gaza , rebuilt , would be governed by the internationally-backed palestinian authority , which is revitalised with money and security forces trained by arab states , including saudi arabia . added to this riyadh would recognise israel , a long-sought after goal for the israelis that would further integrate it into the region . in return the saudis would get advanced american weapons , a security pact with washington and a us-backed civilian nuclear power programme . it sounds impossibly ambitious , and perhaps it is . the americans are not naive about the chances of achieving the most illusive of goals in the middle east , amid some of the worst bloodshed in the region's modern history . but just as he did at the barricades , mr blinken thinks he can use a moment of crisis to grasp the initiative .",gaza : british-palestinian terrified for family in middle east

"" but my personal take is that , once we engage in reconstruction , it will be extremely helpful if we set an election date within a year-and-a-half . and that the world realises we are serious . "" for the past two decades , sea-changes in palestinian politics have been rare - and sometimes violent . despite all this , arab barghouti is optimistic . "" we palestinians don't have the privilege of being hopeless , "" he told me . "" if we lose hope , we lose our country , we lose our land . palestinians need hope . we haven't had hope in a very long time . """,cornish charity launches emergency aid for gaza

2024-03-25T06:08:40.000Z,BBC,"from the first shout of "" fireball "" the crew of hms diamond have just two minutes to react . in that time they have to work out whether the missile , travelling at more than three times the speed of sound , poses a direct threat to their ship and nearby merchant vessels . we were the first media on board hms diamond since she joined the us-led operation to protect merchant shipping in the red sea . we witnessed the threat first-hand as she prepared to run the gauntlet of houthi drones and missiles being fired from yemen . the captain of hms diamond says the houthis are now using more advanced and more lethal weapons . cdr pete evans says when the ship first entered the red sea in december , one-way attack drones , or uavs , were the main threat . but he says the houthis have "" moved much more into conventional and ballistic missiles which are harder to defend against and cause much more damage "" . we began our voyage as the crew made the final checks to the ship's weapons systems . its main sea viper missiles were already primed , hidden in a silo at the front of the ship - with scorch marks still visible from previous launches . each missile costs more than â£1m ( $ 1.3m ) . they are the ship's main line of defence . but diamond also has phalanx machine guns and 30mm cannons on each side of the ship - close-in weapons . the phalanx can fire more than 3,000 rounds a minute . for the very first time the crew have also used the 30mm cannon to successfully shoot down a drone . diamond's main task in the red sea has been to protect merchant ships travelling through this key trade route . but for this mission she'd be escorting a naval task force of uk support ships sailing towards the indian ocean - with two us destroyers providing additional protection . up on the bridge the navigator , lt josh tyrie , showed the route we'd be taking - past houthi-controlled territory in yemen , through the narrow bab al-mandab strait and out into the gulf of aden . they call this the high threat area - where the houthis have been focusing their attacks on both merchant shipping and coalition warships . "" there's a regular drumbeat of drones and missiles , so there's a good possibility that will happen , "" lt tyrie said . by now the entire crew had changed from their blue uniforms to fire-resistant white overalls . we'd all been issued anti-flash hoods and gloves to wear in case the ship was hit . the upper decks were declared out of bounds - with dim red lighting in the ship's passageways . photos of iranian-designed drones , which might be used against the vessel , are displayed along the decks . we waited inside the operations room - the ship's nerve centre - where the crew stare into rows of monitors and screens . with the ship's powerful radar they can track multiple objects simultaneously for hundreds of miles . at 20:35 came the first blast of a whistle with a shout of "" fireball "" - the code for a detected missile launch . the ship's alarm sounded to alert the rest of the crew with the words : "" air threat warning red - missile inbound . "" as they tracked the missile's flight path they issued updates . the air threat was lowered from red to yellow and then white . the tension eased and sailors removed their anti-flash hoods and gloves . it was the first of four anti-ship ballistic missiles fired by the houthis that night . lt cdr martyn harris , diamond's executive officer , explained they had just two minutes to react to launches , with the missile travelling at more than three times the speed of sound . "" yes it can feel a bit intense if someone is potentially trying to shoot something at you , "" he said . diamond has been targeted by the houthis in the past - but in this case the missiles did not pose a direct threat . two days later there's another "" fireball "" warning at 03:20 . once again the alarm is sounded , and the crew rush to their positions . this time too the missile flies out of range and splashes into the sea . hms diamond has not yet shot down any houthi missiles . but it has destroyed nine houthi drones - seven of them in just one night in january . silhouettes of the nine drones are painted on the side of the ship's bridge . diamond is the first royal navy warship to have shot down a threat from the air since 1991 . there's another tense moment on this escort mission , when they locate a signal from the ground to a number of houthi drones . the uavs are flying north of the task group . it's a deadly version of hide and seek . but the drones do not appear to spot them , and one is later shot down by a us warship further north . leading hand erin graham knows what that's like . she was the ship's electronic warfare director on duty on 9 january . she describes it as a "" big swarm attack , which escalated very quickly "" . there were 18 drones in all . six of them were taken out by diamond's sea viper missiles and one was shot down by its 30mm cannon , operated remotely from the operations room . erin , 22 , said "" you've just got to remain cool , calm and collected and go through the drills "" . diamond's captain , cdr pete evans , calls it a challenging tempo of operations , in hot and sticky conditions . "" the levels of concentration [ are ] exhausting , "" he says , with "" long periods of nothing much happening , and then a few really short intense spikes of your life being at risk "" . the 224 military personnel on board work mostly on shifts of between eight and 12 hours , leaving little time to relax . when they're not asleep , most unwind in the gym or watch tv . up in the officers ' wardroom they were playing old episodes of hornblower , the swashbuckling drama series set in the napoleonic era . there's limited wi-fi , but it's often switched off when the threat level rises . even in calmer waters , in the gulf of aden , the job still isn't over . diamond spends several days tracking a suspect fishing vessel , or dhow . it's declared stateless - giving a legal justification to search it . but it has also been flying an iranian flag . the ship's small team of royal marines secure the vessel while another team conduct the search . they're looking for weapons or drugs , but in the end they find nothing illicit . the us has directly accused iran of supplying weapons to the houthis . but diamond's captain is more cautious . cdr evans acknowledges it's likely weapons are being smuggled , but he says he doesn't want to speculate from where . there are hundreds of similar small boats sailing through the wide expanse of the gulf of aden . stemming the supply of weapons may prove even more challenging than stopping the houthi attacks .",on board hms diamond as it faces houthi attacks - bbc news
2024-03-25T14:45:15.000Z,BBC,"the un security council has called for an immediate ceasefire in gaza , after the us did not veto the measure in a shift from its previous position . it also demanded the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages . it is the first time the council has called for a ceasefire since the war began in october after several failed attempts . the move by the us signals growing divergence between it and its ally israel over israel's offensive in gaza . in an unusually strong rebuke , a statement from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu's office said the us had "" abandoned "" its previous position which had directly linked a ceasefire to a hostage release . "" regrettably , the united states did not veto the new resolution , "" it said . the statement said this harmed efforts to release hostages by giving hamas hope it could use international pressure on israel to achieve a ceasefire without freeing the captives . it also said mr netanyahu had decided to cancel meetings between an israeli delegation and us officials in washington that were scheduled for this week . israel's defence minister said israel would not stop the war in gaza while hostages were still being held there . the palestinian representative to the un , riyad mansour , welcomed the resolution but said it was overdue . "" it has taken six months , over 100,000 palestinians killed and maimed , two million displaced , and famine , for this council to finally demand an immediate ceasefire , "" mr mansour said . hamas , the palestinian islamist group which governs gaza and which triggered the war with an unprecedented attack on israel on 7 october , also welcomed the resolution . it said it was ready "" to engage in an immediate prisoner exchange process that leads to the release of prisoners on both sides "" . the group has made any hostage release conditional on the release by israel of palestinians held in israeli prisons . in the security council vote on monday , the us abstained , while the remaining 14 members voted in favour . the us had previously blocked resolutions calling for a ceasefire , saying such a move would be wrong while delicate negotiations for a truce and hostage releases were continuing between israel and hamas . but on thursday it tabled its own draft , which for the first time called for a ceasefire , marking a hardening of its stance towards israel . us national security council spokesman john kirby said the us ' decision to let the resolution pass did not mean a "" shift in our policy "" . he said the us backed a ceasefire but did not vote in favour of the resolution because the text did not condemn hamas . speaking at a press briefing after the resolution was passed , mr kirby said : "" we have been very clear , we have been very consistent in our support for a ceasefire as part of a hostage deal . that's how the hostage deal is structured , and the resolution acknowledges the ongoing talks . "" un secretary general antonio guterres said the resolution "" must be implemented "" to secure a ceasefire and the "" immediate and unconditional release of all hostages "" . mark lyall-grant , who was the uk ambassador to the un from 2009 to 2015 , told bbc radio's 4 pm programme that the resolution meant israel was now "" under an obligation , essentially , to stop its military campaign for the next 15 days "" - the duration of the remainder of the muslim holy month of ramadan , which the text stipulated for the ceasefire . he added that the text was legally binding on israel but not on hamas , as the palestinian group is not a state . the us had previously been accused of using its power of veto to shield israel at the un . however , it has become increasingly critical of israel over the escalating death toll in gaza , where more than 32,000 people - mainly women and children - have been killed by israel's bombardment , according to the territory's hamas-run health ministry . the us has also pressed israel to do more to get aid delivered to gaza , where it says the entire population is suffering severe levels of acute food insecurity . the un has accused israel of obstructing aid ; israel has blamed the un , accusing it of failing to carry out distributions . the current war broke out after hamas gunmen burst through the border and attacked israeli communities , killing about 1,200 people , according to israeli tallies , and taking 253 into gaza as hostages . of those taken , 130 remain unaccounted for following a series of releases , rescues and the recovery of bodies . despite israel's decision to cancel a planned visit by its delegation to washington later this week in the wake of the security council resolution , mr kirby has said that scheduled meetings between israeli defence minister yoav gallant and us national security adviser jake sullivan will continue as planned .

"" we woke up at 02:30 [ on sunday ] . there was constant gunfire within the surroundings of the hospital . our co-worker amir was martyred while he was at the human resources [ office ] . he was hit in the chest by a bullet and died immediately , "" samy al-omry , one of the paramedics at al-amal , told bbc arabic's gaza lifeline radio service while he walked to al-mawasi on monday .

"" the hospital was besieged for over 40 days and was repeatedly bombed before the occupation forces reinstated the siege and forced everyone inside to leave , "" it added . the israel defense forces ( idf ) said on tuesday morning that its troops were "" eliminating terrorists and carrying out targeted raids on terrorist infrastructure "" in the al-amal area , where the hospital is located , and in nearby al-qarara .

"" today's resolution gives hamas hope that international pressure will force israel to accept a ceasefire without the release of our hostages , thus harming both the war effort and the effort to release the hostages , "" mr netanyahu's office said in a statement . it added that , "" in light of the change in the us position "" , a visit by an israeli delegation to the us this week would not go ahead . israeli and us officials had been due to meet to discuss israel's planned offensive in the southern gaza city of rafah , where some 1.5 million palestinians have sought shelter , having fled the fighting elsewhere in gaza . us secretary of state antony blinken has said publicly that a ground operation in rafah risks killing more civilians and is "" not the way "" to defeat hamas . on the ground there was no indication of a let up in hostilities , as israeli warplanes continued to bomb rafah . fierce gun battles also raged around hospitals in nearby khan younis and gaza city . rocket warning sirens also sounded in israeli border towns . responding to mr netanyahu's decision to cancel the israeli delegation's visit to washington , us national security council spokesman john kirby said it was "" disappointing "" but reiterated the us view that "" a major ground offensive in rafah would be a major mistake "" . mr kirby said that scheduled meetings between israeli defence minister yoav gallant and us national security advisor jake sullivan would go ahead as planned . yair lapid , israel's opposition leader and former prime minister , criticised mr netanyahu's decision , described the episode as "" unnecessary "" and said mr netanyahu had been "" irresponsible "" .

"" un security council resolutions are widely considered to be legally binding on un member states , although the us has said it does not consider monday's vote to be binding on israel . mr gallant has said israel will not stop the war in gaza while hostages are still being held there . the hostages were seized when hamas attacked southern israel on 7 october , killing about 1,200 people , most of them civilians . the palestinian representative to the un , riyad mansour , welcomed the resolution but said it was overdue . "" it has taken six months , over 100,000 palestinians killed and maimed , two million displaced , and famine , for this council to finally demand an immediate ceasefire , "" he said . hamas has welcomed the vote , but also told mediators it was sticking to its original demands for a comprehensive ceasefire which include the withdrawal of israeli troops from gaza and a return of displaced palestinians to the north of the strip . the israeli prime minister's office described this as "" unrealistic . "" talks between israeli and hamas representatives continue via mediators in qatar . reports suggest that a deal currently being proposed would see 40 israeli hostages released in exchange for 800 palestinian prisoners . monday's resolution came amid huge concern over the dire humanitarian situation in gaza . last week , mr blinken warned that the entire population of gaza was experiencing "" severe levels of acute food insecurity "" . the un world food programme has also warned that , in gaza's two northern governorates , famine is expected to set in by may unless the flow of aid into the territory is increased . following monday's vote , un secretary-general antónio guterres said the resolution "" must be implemented "" and that "" failure would be unforgivable "" . early on tuesday , the british government announced that it had carried out its first airdrop of food into gaza . it said the royal air force drop included 10 tonnes of supplies : water , rice , cooking oil , flour , tinned goods and baby formula . it also repeated calls on israel to allow more aid in via gaza's ports and to open more land crossings into the territory .","' he will come back ’ - israeli hostage families cling to hope , and demand a deal"
2024-03-26T13:59:15.000Z,BBC,"a un human rights expert says she believes israel has committed "" acts of genocide "" in gaza . francesca albanese , the un special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied palestinian territories , presented her report to un member states in geneva on tuesday . but israel has already dismissed her findings . this comes amid growing international pressure on israel to stop the war or to do much more to protect civilians . ms albanese concluded that "" there are reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold indicating the commission of the crime of genocide against palestinians as a group in gaza has been met "" . before ms albanese even got to her feet , her findings had been dismissed by israel , whose ambassador described it as "" an outrageous distortion of the genocide convention "" . israel has for years been angered by the un human rights council's agenda , which permanently devotes an entire section - item 7 - to scrutiny of the situation in "" palestine and the other occupied arab territories "" . the agenda item was approved not by the un itself , but by un member states , decades ago , and has never expired . no other country in the world has permanent scrutiny like this , and israel views it as discriminatory , and aimed at delegitimising israel . it refuses to attend the council when item 7 is under discussion . but many countries , in particular those in the middle east , argue that the situation - in the absence of self-determination for palestinians through a two-state solution - requires ongoing investigation , and now that there is another conflict , all the more so . since hamas's brutal attack on israel on 7 october , ms albanese has called for the release of the hostages , and does so again in this report . in it she "" firmly condemns the crimes committed by hamas and other palestinian armed groups in israel on 7 october "" . but she has also been outspoken in her criticism of israel's conduct of the war in gaza . that's why her report has been awaited with both impatience , and trepidation . ms albanese's choice of a title for it : ' anatomy of a genocide ' was not exactly diplomatic . many member states , especially those traditionally supportive of israel , will be uncomfortable . but un special rapporteurs , while tasked by the un to examine and advise on specific situations , are independent of it . genocide is a specific legal term , and ms albanese's report suggests some of the legal criteria have been fulfilled . she cites what she says appears to be israel's intention to destroy palestinians as a group "" in whole or in part "" , a key clause in the convention against genocide . she mentions in particular three elements which point to possible genocide : the death toll in gaza , currently well over 32,000 according to gaza's hamas-run health ministry , the bombing of densely populated areas , and the restrictions on aid supplies ( which , the un says , have brought gaza to the brink of famine ) , are all proof , the report claims , of intent to destroy the group . basel alsourani , of the palestinian centre for human rights , welcomed the report . he suggested international law had been violated by all sides in this conflict , but argued that genocide was such a serious crime the international community could not ignore it . "" allowing genocide to happen doesn't only affect palestinians … , it affects all human beings around the world , "" he said . "" if now israel is committing genocide without accountability , tomorrow we don't know which country will claim that genocide has been committed by israel , and [ therefore ] i can commit genocide with no accountability . "" tala nasir , a palestinian human rights lawyer who also travelled to geneva to hear the report , hoped it would draw more attention to the fate of what she said were thousands of people detained by israel since 7 october . "" they have arrested more than 7,700 palestinians , "" she said . "" eighty per cent of them are being held under administrative detention which means they are not presenting any charges against them . "" their families , she pointed out , had no contact with them , and no idea where they were . not surprisingly , israeli diplomats are angry . its ambassador to the un in geneva , meirav eilon shahar , described the report as "" an obscene inversion of reality "" , and accused ms albanese of questioning israel's right to exist . many israelis , too , are likely to be shocked . and the suggestion of genocide , towards a state which was founded as a direct result of nazi germany's genocide of jews , will cause deep offence . in the wake of 7 october attack , and the fact that so many israeli families are still waiting for news of loved ones taken hostage , hearing such outspoken condemnation is hard . noam peri , whose father chaim was taken hostage , also travelled to geneva . her focus , naturally , is that her father not be forgotten .

"" when you put all kinds of requirements on the table that are unreasonable in an emergency … that brings up the question , with all the restrictions that we currently see , whether there is a plausible claim to be made that starvation is , or may be used as , a weapon of war . "" concern about humanitarian catastrophe in the gaza strip deepened last week with the release of a soberly written commentary alongside a series of maps , charts and statistics . it prompted more warnings from israel's allies that it should change the way it is fighting the war against hamas to spare civilians from death from either high explosive or hunger . the study is the latest report from a respected international network , the integrated food security phase classification , known as ipc . it provides governments , the un and aid agencies with apolitical data to measure the scale of hunger . the headline on the report was stark - "" gaza strip : famine is imminent as 1.1 million people , half of gaza , experience catastrophic food insecurity . "" its data explained how famine could come at any time in the next eight weeks or so if there was no ceasefire and relief aid did not pour into the gaza strip . palestinian parents who had managed to bring sick and hungry children to one of the few hospitals still operating in gaza after israel's onslaught did not have to wait for the statistics . for weeks and months , as they struggled to feed them , they have watched their children decline . gaza is no place to be ill . one young girl at the hospital , reached by a palestinian freelance journalist working for the bbc , lay semi-conscious on a bed . the girl , noora mohammed , has lung and liver fibrosis , conditions that can be fatal even in peacetime . in the months of starvation since the war began , and without the right medical care , she is deteriorating fast . "" my daughter can't move , "" her mother said . "" she's anaemic , always sleeping , and there's nothing nutritious to eat . "" at least noora reached hospital . most of just over one million gazans considered to be in acute need will not have that option . the evidence of gaza's humanitarian catastrophe is overwhelming . our pictures from the hospital showed children with swollen joints , wasted limbs and dermatitis , all classic symptoms of acute malnutrition . israel has ignored the un security council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire . nir barkat , the israeli economy minister , said that nothing would be allowed to get in the way of israel's war aim of smashing hamas for good and freeing the hostages taken on 7 october . allies around the world , he said , supported israel's strategic goal . when i pointed out many of israel's friends , starting with us president joe biden , did not like the way israel was fighting the war , mr barkat was blunt . "" that's tough . we are going to finish the war . we'll do everything we can to kill the hamas terrorists and to minimise collateral damage as much as we can , "" he said . "" with all due respect , we're fighting evil , and we expect the world to help us fight evil until we finish hamas off the map . "" the un high commissioner for human rights had a succinct response to stinging criticism from israel . "" the only thing i can say to them is that there is an emerging international consensus , and it may not have been there before , but it is clearly there now , including with this week's security council resolution , on the humanitarian situation , "" mr türk said . "" the human rights situation is so tragic that an immediate ceasefire is required . that's my response to that . """,israel-gaza : aid reaches gaza shore in first sea delivery
2024-03-29T02:05:05.000Z,BBC,"the un's top court has ordered israel to enable the unhindered flow of aid into gaza in order to avert a famine . in a unanimous decision , the international court of justice ( icj ) said israel had to act "" without delay "" to allow the "" provision . . . of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance "" . this follows warnings that famine could hit gaza within weeks . israel has called allegations it is blocking aid "" wholly unfounded "" . giving its response to the court order , the israeli foreign ministry said it was continuing "" to promote new initiatives , and to expand existing ones "" to allow a continuous flow of aid into gaza "" by land , air and sea "" , working with the un and others . it said that hamas was to blame for the situation in gaza and for starting the war . the latest ruling by the court in the hague comes after south africa asked it to bolster an order issued to israel in january to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in gaza . south africa said it had an obligation to act to prevent genocide as a signatory of the un's 1948 genocide convention . the country has been highly critical of israel's military operation in gaza and its governing african national congress ( anc ) has a long history of solidarity with the palestinian cause . although orders issued by the icj are legally binding , the court lacks the power to enforce them . the un security council is the only un body which can introduce measures to try to ensure compliance . the icj's ruling comes after a report by the integrated food security phase classification global initiative , which is run by the world food programme and others , was published last week - warning that a "" catastrophic "" situation was developing in gaza . it said that all of the 2.2 million people in gaza were "" facing high levels of acute food insecurity "" and that famine was projected to hit the north of the territory before the end of may . famine occurs when a country has such a severe food shortage that its population faces acute undernourishment , starvation , or death . in its ruling , the icj said gaza was "" no longer facing only a risk of famine "" but "" famine is setting in "" and that , according to un observers , 31 people , including 27 children , had already died of malnutrition and dehydration . the court also noted comments by volker tã¼rk , the un's high commissioner for human rights , who said last week that the "" situation of hunger , starvation and famine "" was "" a result of israel's extensive restrictions on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid and commercial goods , displacement of most of the population , as well as the destruction of crucial civilian infrastructure "" . mr tã¼rk recently told the bbc that there was a "" plausible "" case that israel was using starvation as a weapon of war in gaza and that , if intent was proven , this would amount to a war crime . the icj said israel had to "" take all necessary and effective measures to ensure , without delay , in full co-operation with the united nations , the unhindered provision at scale . . . of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance "" . the aid most needed included food , water , electricity , fuel , shelter and clothing as well as hygiene products and medical supplies , it said . in recent months long queues of aid trucks have repeatedly formed as they wait to enter gaza from egypt , and accusations have been levelled at israel that it is subjecting the deliveries to complex and arbitrary checks . israel has also said that hamas takes much of the aid that enters gaza and accused the un of failing to distribute what is left to the civilian population . the current conflict began after the 7 october attack , which saw hamas-led gunmen storm across the border into israel , killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 others hostage . of those taken , about 130 remain unaccounted for , at least 34 of whom are presumed dead . gaza's hamas-run health ministry says israel's retaliatory campaign has killed at least 32,623 people . earlier this month , us defence secretary lloyd austin said that , of those killed , more than 25,000 were women and children . israel has vowed to press on with its mission to eliminate hamas , despite the un security council passing a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire earlier this week . israel's military recently launched another raid on al-shifa hospital - gaza's biggest - where thousands of displaced people are sheltering . al-amal hospital in southern gaza was taken out of service earlier this week after israeli troops forced medics and patients to evacuate , the palestine red crescent society reported . there have also been repeated israeli air strikes on what it says are hamas targets throughout gaza . israel has threatened to launch an offensive in the southern city of rafah , where more than 1.5 million palestinians are sheltering .",un observers wounded by shelling in southern lebanon -

the revolutionary guards ' overseas operations arm - and served as commander in lebanon and syria between 2008 and 2016 . haji-rahimi was meanwhile identified as zahedi's deputy . zahedi is one of the most high-profile iranian figures believed to have been killed by israel in the country's long campaign of targeted assassinations . the uk-based syrian observatory for human rights , which relies on a network of sources on the ground in syria , reported that eight people were killed -

2024-04-01T15:17:04.000Z,BBC,"iran's revolutionary guards say seven officers have been killed in an israeli strike on the iranian consulate building in syria's capital , damascus . brig-gen mohammad reza zahedi , a senior commander of the elite quds force , and brig-gen mohammad hadi haji-rahimi , his deputy , were named among the dead . iran and syria's governments condemned the attack , which destroyed a building next door to the iranian embassy . the israeli military said it did not comment on foreign media reports . however , it has acknowledged carrying out hundreds of strikes in recent years on targets in syria that it says are linked to iran and allied armed groups which are armed , funded and trained by the revolutionary guards . the israeli strikes have reportedly been stepped up since the start of the war in gaza in october last year , in response to cross-border attacks on northern israel by hezbollah and other iran-backed groups in lebanon and syria . but monday's attack will be seen as a serious escalation . the israelis appear to be testing the resolve of the iranians and their allies and signalling that they are serious about increasing pressure on their enemies . the israelis are looking at the fact that both iran and hezbollah have not been pushing as hard as some might expect . now they will see if iran and hezbollah are going to push back . there will be a response , but it may not be the one people expect . rather than missiles , it may be some sort of cyber-attack . syria's defence ministry said israeli aircraft targeted the iranian consulate building , which was on a highway in the western mezzeh district of damascus , from the direction of the occupied golan heights at about 17:00 local time ( 14:00 gmt ) on monday . syrian air defences shot down some of the missiles they launched , but others made it through and "" destroyed the entire building , killing and injuring everyone inside "" , the ministry added . the ministry said work was under way to recover the bodies and rescue the wounded from beneath the rubble , without saying how many casualties there were or naming any of them . photos and videos from the scene showed smoke and dust rising from the remains of the collapsed multi-storey building . the iranian embassy next door did not appear to have sustained any significant damage . the iranian ambassador , hossein akbari , said israeli f-35 fighter jets "" brutally targeted my place of residence and the consular section of the embassy , along with iran's military attaches "" . he told iranian state tv that between five and seven people were killed , including some diplomats . later , the revolutionary guards put out a statement saying that seven of its officers were killed , including brig-gen mohammad reza zahedi and brig-gen mohammad hadi haji-rahimi , whom it described as commanders and "" senior military advisers "" . iranian media said zahedi , 63 , was a senior figure in the quds force - the revolutionary guards ' overseas operations arm - and served as commander in lebanon and syria between 2008 and 2016 . haji-rahimi was meanwhile identified as zahedi's deputy . zahedi is one of the most high-profile iranian figures believed to have been killed by israel in the country's long campaign of targeted assassinations . the uk-based syrian observatory for human rights , which relies on a network of sources on the ground in syria , reported that eight people were killed -

2024-04-02T09:41:43.000Z,BBC,"republican speaker of the house mike johnson has a plan for getting new military assistance for ukraine approved by congress - and for keeping his tenuous hold on power . with democrats wary and a republican right flank eyeing open rebellion , however , mr johnson may find that even the best-laid plans could quickly unravel . the louisiana congressman told fox news he would push the house - which has the narrowest of republican majorities - to structure new ukraine support in the form of loans . to help cover the costs he suggested authorising the us government to seize and sell russian assets frozen since the start of the ukraine war . "" if we can use the seized assets of russian oligarchs to allow the ukrainians to fight them , that's just pure poetry , "" said mr johnson . an estimated $ 300bn ( £ 239bn ) in russian central bank assets have been frozen - although most of this is under european , not american , control . as an additional sweetener for his republican colleagues , he also proposed tying the passage of ukraine aid to legislation ending a hold on new liquefied natural gas export authorisations . the hold was imposed by the biden administration in january at the behest of environmental activists . this wouldn't be the first time republicans have tried to tie ukraine assistance - which is opposed by a growing number of conservative voters and a small but vocal group of legislators - to an unrelated political priority for the party . in february , senate republicans negotiated with democrats to construct a legislative package that included funding for ukraine along with conservative immigration reforms and resources for border security . the deal collapsed , however , after republican presidential candidate donald trump voiced his opposition and his supporters in congress - including mr johnson in the house - followed suit . the white house says approved ukraine aid ran out at the beginning of the year and has repeatedly warned that the nation is losing ground in its war against russia because of a lack of continued american backing . in the house of representatives , pro-aid legislators have been gathering signatures for a parliamentary procedure that would trigger a vote on a senate-approved measure that authorises new aid for ukraine and israel - essentially forcing mr johnson's hand . the house speaker's latest proposal may be a way to forestall such a direct erosion of his power to set the legislative agenda . as mr johnson grapples with how to help ukraine , however , he stands on unstable ground . the man who assumed the speakership after his predecessor was ousted last year by a right-wing rebellion is facing similar unrest from his party's hard-core right . his negotiated deal with democrats to avoid a government shutdown two weeks ago prompted one conservative firebrand , georgia congresswoman marjorie taylor greene , to file a motion for his removal . while she has not taken steps to force a vote on the matter , she has warned that she will if mr johnson isn't ultimately replaced . later this month , republican membership in the house will drop to 217 - meaning it would only take two republicans to join the chamber's 213 democrats to launch an attempt to oust mr johnson . on sunday night , mr johnson tried to reset expectations for his party - and buy himself some breathing room . "" we have the smallest majority , literally , right now in us history , "" he said . "" so we're not going to get the legislation that we all desire and prefer . "" this mathematical reality puts the speaker in a delicate situation . if he angers even a handful of republicans , such as by striking a deal to help ukraine , it may trigger an uprising . and if he doesn't do enough to placate democrats , they may once again help the rebellious conservatives execute their plot . with national elections to decide the presidency and control of both chambers of congress set for november , mr johnson - and his fellow republicans - can ill afford to appear rife with internal divisions and incapable of governing . "" this is not an easy job right now , "" mr johnson said .",bbc follows gaza’s tireless paramedics as they confront death and trauma at every turn

2024-04-03T13:37:06.000Z,BBC,"all except the shortest wars have times when killing is an unchanging , grim routine . there are also moments , like the last few days in the middle east , when events leave belligerents and their allies at a crossroads with big decisions to make . choices are confronting leaders in the governments and armed forces in israel and tehran , at hezbollah's hq in the southern suburbs of beirut and further afield in the gulf , europe and america . the killing of foreign aid workers in gaza might finally exhaust the considerable patience of israel's allies , led by the united states . israel and egypt have banned foreign journalists from entering gaza , except on occasional , highly controlled and brief visits with the israeli military . belligerents need to win the media battle in an age of asymmetric warfare where victory or defeat can rely on perceptions as much as the realities of battle . journalists are also denied access to a war when the parties fighting it have something to hide . but even without foreign reporters on the scene , evidence is piling up that israel is not , as it claims , respecting its obligations under the laws of war to respect civilian lives , or allowing the free movement of aid in a famine created by israel's own actions . after the world central kitchen team was killed in gaza , president biden used his strongest language yet in public statements to condemn israel's actions . the president and his aides have now to decide whether words are enough . so far , they have resisted calls to put conditions on the use of american weapons in gaza , or even to turn off the supply line . while the weapons still arrive , israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu , who depends on hardline jewish ultranationalists to stay in office , might feel he can still afford to defy president biden . a major test will be the offensive israel wants to attack hamas in rafah , plans the us believes would compound the humanitarian catastrophe in gaza . american interests and joe biden's political prospects in an election year have already been damaged by what is seen in many countries as complicity with israel . in another change this week , mr netanyahu has come back to work after two days off for hernia surgery to huge demonstrations demanding his resignation and early elections for a new parliament . deep cultural and political fissures between israelis that were put to one side after 7 october are wide open again and being shouted about in the streets . the prime minister is in political trouble , blamed by his opponents for letting down israel's guard so badly that hamas detected a chance to attack . millions of israelis who believe they are fighting a just war against hamas have no confidence in mr netanyahu . their charge sheet includes prolonging the war to put off the moment when he is held accountable for his mistakes , failing to bring israel's hostages home safely , and alienating vital allies starting with president biden . add to that the fact that after a huge onslaught over six months hamas is still fighting , and its senior leader in gaza , yahya sinwar is still alive somewhere in the strip . another new set of calculations about the next stages of the crisis in the middle east arise from the assassination of a senior iranian general in damascus , widely assumed in israel to be the work of its air force . it was a coup for intelligence services that missed or ignored the hamas attacks six months ago . it was also an escalation in the wider war in the region that will have consequences . some of them may happen close to where i'm writing this , looking across the sea of galilee towards the golan heights , the large swathe of southern syria that israel captured in the 1967 middle east war and later annexed . as the crow flies , damascus is less than 50 miles from here . the border with lebanon is close by . at night , especially , there is constant israeli air activity , with the roar of jets on patrol , or heading off to bomb lebanon or syria . a shadow war has been fought here in parallel with the war in gaza since last october . it started with hezbollah , the powerful lebanese militia and political movement attacking israel , in support of hamas in gaza . it was not the onslaught that the hamas leadership was hoping for - neither hezbollah or its patrons in tehran wanted an all-out war with israel and , indirectly , its american backers . the americans did not want that either and restrained israel's instinct to respond in full force . but hezbollah still tied down thousands of israeli troops and forced the evacuation of something like 80,000 civilians from the border areas . israel's response , limited compared to earlier border wars , forced the displacement of at least as many civilians on the lebanese side . since the start of this year it has been different . israel has been setting the pace , bombing its enemies deeper inside lebanon and syria . the biggest leap up the ladder of escalation came on monday with the assassination by air strike on the iranian diplomatic compound in the syrian capital . in interviews here in northern israel local officials and residents have expressed strong support not just for the assassination but for an invasion of south lebanon to destroy hezbollah and force them back from the border . they were not put off by israel's experience in the last two decades of the 20th century , when it occupied a broad strip of south lebanon to try to protect northern israel . it even created its own lebanese militia to help with the fighting . the israelis pulled out in 2000 , under constant military harassment from hezbollah , after prime minister ehud barak , a former head of the army , decided that occupying south lebanon ( israel called it the "" security zone "" ) did not make israelis any safer and wasted the lives of its troops . i walked through the ruins of the avivim winery , which is right on the border wire . it was destroyed in a hezbollah strike last week . its owner shlomi biton showed me through the wreck of his business . he is 47 and was born in avivim , which like the rest of northern israel has become a ghost town after the evacuations . shlomi fought in lebanon during his military service , and now believes that the only way to restore a decent and safe life is for israel to return to lebanon for a decisive battle with hezbollah . "" there's no other choice , "" he told me next his burnt-out business . "" otherwise , the community won't return to live here , maybe just a few crazy guys like me - the children won't come back . "" in kiryat shmona , a border town where 25,000 israelis lived , no more than 3,000 people , mostly soldiers and essential workers , are left . the mayor , avichai stern , showed me deserted districts and wrecked buildings . he believes that israel can remove hezbollah's threat to the north with a decisive and destructive invasion on the lines of the gaza war . mayor stern said last year 10,000 hezbollah fighters practised taking over northern israel .

"" israel is at war with hamas , not with the people of gaza , "" he stressed . however , aid groups say they are not sure such promises will lead to meaningful changes . they also assert that this was not an isolated incident , with 196 palestinian aid workers reportedly killed since the war began in october . jan egeland , the secretary-general of the norwegian refugee council and a former un humanitarian chief , told the bbc that wck was "" among those who have the closest co-operation with the israelis "" , in terms of sharing information about their workers ' locations and planned movements . before the strike , wck was playing an increasingly prominent and important role in gaza , with 400 palestinian staff and 3,000 people working indirectly for it in its 68 community kitchens and distribution system . wck has provided 12 % of the 193,000 tonnes of aid from international organisations that had reached gaza since october , according to data from cogat , the israeli defence ministry body tasked with co-ordinating deliveries . however , un agencies were responsible for 80 % of the total . wck's founder , the chef josã © andrã©s , told reuters news agency on wednesday that it was "" analysing the situation and how to keep doing the work we do "" . anera - which was providing 150,000 meals a day in collaboration with wck - said it understood the consequences pausing its own work would have on palestinians , but that its palestinian staff had for the first time deemed the risk to their safety and that of their families "" intolerable "" . it said the charity's logistics co-ordinator and his son had been killed in an israeli air strike in deir al-balah in march , despite the fact that the co-ordinates of the shelter where they were staying had been provided to the israeli military .

"" israel is at war with hamas , not with the people of gaza , "" he stressed . however , aid groups say they are not sure such promises will lead to meaningful changes . they also assert that this was not an isolated incident , with 196 palestinian aid workers reportedly killed since the war began in october . jan egeland , the secretary-general of the norwegian refugee council and a former un humanitarian chief , told the bbc that wck was "" among those who have the closest co-operation with the israelis "" , in terms of sharing information about their workers ' locations and planned movements . before the strike , wck was playing an increasingly prominent and important role in gaza , with 400 palestinian staff and 3,000 people working indirectly for it in its 68 community kitchens and distribution system . wck has provided 12 % of the 193,000 tonnes of aid from international organisations that had reached gaza since october , according to data from cogat , the israeli defence ministry body tasked with co-ordinating deliveries . however , un agencies were responsible for 80 % of the total . wck's founder , the chef josé andrés , told reuters news agency on wednesday that it was "" analysing the situation and how to keep doing the work we do "" . anera - which was providing 150,000 meals a day in collaboration with wck - said it understood the consequences pausing its own work would have on palestinians , but that its palestinian staff had for the first time deemed the risk to their safety and that of their families "" intolerable "" . it said the charity's logistics co-ordinator and his son had been killed in an israeli air strike in deir al-balah in march , despite the fact that the co-ordinates of the shelter where they were staying had been provided to the israeli military . "" we've asked for explanation as to why that site was struck and we've received none , "" derek madsen of anera told the bbc . "" these sites are known and so i think it is very difficult for us to understand how these strikes happen . "" project hope , another us-based organisation , paused its work for three days in solidarity with wck and to "" reassess the security situation as we prioritise our staff members ' safety "" . arlan fuller , director of emergency preparedness and response , said in a statement sent to the bbc that its employees were deeply concerned by the deaths of the wck team , and that the strike has raised significant doubts about the effectiveness of co-ordination with the israeli military . for the people of gaza , the suspension of wck's operations "" means more famine , more dead children , more epidemic disease because people are so malnourished "" , mr egeland warned . at least 27 children are reported to have died as a result of malnutrition since october , according to the world health organization . mr egeland urged israel to start by opening the karni and erez border crossings with northern gaza to allow aid convoys to drive there directly . most aid convoys are currently forced to start at the israeli-controlled kerem shalom and egyptian-controlled rafah crossings with the south of gaza and then pass through what the un calls "" high-risk areas "" , mainly due to shooting and shelling or the breakdown in civil order . cogat says israeli forces have co-ordinated the entry of more than 500 lorries into the north over the past two months via those routes as well as a new gate and military road that runs south of gaza city . israel has also facilitated the now-suspended maritime corridor set up by wck as well as airdrops of aid by western and arab countries . the un says both are helpful but cannot replace the large-scale delivery of aid by land . the first wck aid ship was carrying 200 tonnes of aid and took several days to reach gaza . by comparison , a lorry can carry about 20 tonnes and the nearest israeli container port is only a 40km drive from northern gaza . a c-130 transport plane meanwhile has a maximum payload of 21 tonnes , but only about 40 airdrops have taken place so far and they are considered expensive , ineffective and dangerous for people on the ground . the un says 159 lorry loads of aid crossed into gaza by land each day on average between 1 and 28 march , and that the pre-war average was 500 lorry loads , including fuel . cogat says the pre-war average only included 70 food lorries and that 140 entered each day during march . it insists there is no limit to the amount of food and other humanitarian aid that can enter gaza and accuses un agencies of failing to distribute aid effectively . there was no apparent drop-off in aid crossing into gaza following the strike on the wck convoy , with 217 lorries transferred via israel and egypt on wednesday and 179 food packages being airdropped , according to cogat . but nate mook , who was chief executive of wck until 2022 , warned that the longer-term consequences could be "" devastating "" for gazans because "" we probably have not seen the last of the aid organisations to pull out "" . zawar ali of international medical corps told the bbc that it was reconsidering its safety protocols and whether to restrict its workers ' movements . it had already decided to relocate its field hospital from the north of rafah to al-mawasi , an area to the west which the israeli military has declared "" humanitarian zone "" but has still carried out strikes on what it says are hamas targets . dr bashar murad , the executive director of the palestinian red crescent , said many of its paramedics were refusing to evacuate wounded and sick people from the north to the south in their ambulances due to the lack of safety guarantees , despite their protection under international law and co-ordination efforts by international organisations . aseel baidoun of medical aid for palestinians said it had not suspended operations after a strike in january damaged a residential compound in al-mawasi that housed the british charity's local team and their families , injuring several people . but now , she added : "" we really are scared of the security [ situation ] . "" "" if a foreigner with international immunity is bombed and killed , then what will they do to us ? "" mohammed aborjela , a palestinian online content creator who launched the youth of gaza initiative to deliver aid after the war began , told bbc . he said palestinian aid workers faced higher risks and greater challenges than their international colleagues , but insisted it would not stop him and his colleagues continuing their work .

"" accountability is the only hope of justice i have "" , he said . "" i don't believe our government will hold the correct people to account , but i guarantee that our government will sell weapons to israel , which may in turn be used to kill our fellow citizens . "" it's hard to comprehend that . "" british arms sales to israel are lower than those of other countries , including germany and italy , and dwarfed by the billions supplied by its largest arms supplier , the us . but a uk ban would add to the diplomatic and political pressure on israel , at a time when its conduct in the gaza conflict is coming under renewed international scrutiny . the bbc understands there is an ongoing assessment over whether to suspend or revoke existing export licenses to israel , which is almost finished . that assessment , which will advise on the risk of israel breaching international law , is not a result of the recent air strike . in fact it may not even consider the incident , since it is looking at israel's actions from early 2024 . technically it is up to the business secretary to decide on issuing arms export licenses , but one mp familiar with the process said , in reality , it will be mr sunak who will make the decision when the foreign office issues its legal advice . on thursday evening , former uk foreign secretary jack straw told the bbc he believed it was "" perfectly obvious "" israel was breaching international law . mr straw told radio 4's pm programme that israeli forces had been "" caught out "" by the killing of western aid workers but suggested they "" would have dug in and refused any accountability at all "" if all the victims had been palestinian . former supreme court president lady hale was among the lawyers , academics and retired senior judges who signed a 17-page letter to the government on the issue of arms sales to israel . it says "" serious action "" is needed to "" avoid uk complicity in grave breaches of international law , including potential violations of the genocide convention "" . the group add that the sale of arms and weapons systems to israel "" falls significantly short "" of the government's obligations under international law , given the "" plausible risk of genocide "" in gaza - a situation that the letters says was highlighted in a provisional judgement issued by the international court of justice ( icj ) in january - and the worsening humanitarian situation since . speaking on bbc radio 4's today programme , lord sumption , the former supreme court judge who was one of the most notable signatories , said the uk had a duty to prevent genocide and there was a "" plausible case that is what is happening "" in gaza . he added that the "" framework of international law around war "" does not mean countries can act however they want , even if they have been provoked or attacked , "" however outrageously "" . lord sumption continued : "" it doesn't mean to say that you can indiscriminately slaughter innocent civilians and children . it doesn't mean to say you can attack aid convoys . . . it doesn't mean to say you can spend two weeks flattening hospitals . "" among other actions the letter says the government must take to meet its obligations under international law are : mr sunak called for an independent investigation into the air strike , but stopped short of saying arms sales should end , in an interview with the sun newspaper after the incident . he added that the uk had been "" consistently clear "" with israel that it must follow international humanitarian law . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has described the attack as unintended and "" tragic "" , and promised an independent investigation . it rejects the claim of genocide as "" wholly unfounded "" . the uk has licenced arms to israel worth over £ 574m since 2008 , when official country-level data was made available , according to pressure group campaign against arms trade ( caat ) . business minister greg hands has previously told mps the figure for 2022 - £ 42m - represented 0.02 % of israel's military imports that year . arms export licences , which are granted by the business department , cannot be issued if there is a clear risk the weapons could be used in a serious violation of international humanitarian law . labour has not called for a suspension , but is urging the government to publish internal legal advice on whether israel is in breach of international law . the snp is calling for parliament to be recalled from its current easter break , ending on 15 april , to debate the issue . conservative mp paul bristow said the idea british-made arms could be used in action that kills innocent civilians in gaza "" turns the stomach .

"" but [ jacob ] felt the world central kitchen knew what they were doing there , "" he said , and his son "" knew that people were starving out there "" . his parents called on the us to stop sending military aid to israel while the country was using "" food as a weapon "" - a reference to the lack of aid getting into gaza . "" the us has great leverage over israel , "" mr flickinger said . jacob's parents also called for a ceasefire , a return of all israeli hostages held by hamas and for more aid to war-torn gaza . mr flickinger also said he wanted the us government to launch an independent investigation into the killings of humanitarian workers , as well as for israel to pay reparations to relatives who have lost loved ones in gaza . "" justice can start there , but most critically , end this insanity , "" he said . "" i grew up without having a father , "" mr flickinger said . "" now my grandson will grow up without having his father . "" ms labrecque said she hoped their grandson , jasper , would serve as a reminder of their son's life and goodness . "" it's going to be a day-to-day job , to heal from that loss , "" she said . "" but jasper will be a very good inspiration for us to stay strong . "" mr flickinger said that he had spoken to the canadian government , but had not heard from the white house . he said he was told about his son's death from the us embassy in israel .

2024-04-05T21:32:32.000Z,BBC,"the sudden decision by mcdonald's to take over ownership of its branches in israel has thrust the franchise company alonyal and its chief executive omri padan into the spotlight . mcdonald's will buy back all of its israeli restaurants after global sales slumped due to a boycott of the brand over its perceived support for israel in its war against hamas in gaza . the fast-food giant uses a franchise system which means that individual operators are licensed to run outlets and employ staff . but the broader company came in for criticism after mr padan offered free meals to israeli forces around the start of the israel-gaza war on 7 october . a boycott was sparked after muslim-majority countries such as kuwait , malaysia and pakistan issued statements distancing themselves from the firm for what they saw as support of israel . mr padan , however , is not new to controversy related to the israeli-palestinian conflict . in the 30 years the businessman has been operating restaurants for mcdonald's in israel , he has been at the centre of a number of disputes . in 2013 , the israeli businessman angered israel's settler movement when he refused calls to open a branch of the fast-food chain in the settlement of ariel in the occupied west bank . mr padan's company alonyal was asked to set up a restaurant in a shopping centre but declined , saying the firm had a policy of staying out of the occupied territories . at the time , the firm said the decision had not been co-ordinated with mcdonald's headquarters in the us . israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 jews since it occupied the west bank and east jerusalem - land the palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 middle east war . the vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law , although israel disputes this . mr padan is one of the founders of the group peace now , which opposes all settlements and views them as obstacles to peace . peace now says he is no longer a member of the group , which was founded in 1978 . a leader of the yesha council , the settlers ' umbrella organisation , said at the time that mcdonald's had gone from being a for-profit company to one with an "" anti-israeli political agenda "" . alonyal's decision resurfaced in 2019 when mcdonald's won a tender to run a restaurant and hot dog stand at israel's ben-gurion airport . in response , several letters of protest were sent by settlement leaders in the west bank that called on the finance and transportation ministries , as well as the israel airport authority , to block the move . protests were also held outside the fast-food chain's restaurants in tel aviv . and on thursday , it was abruptly announced that alonyal would sell the sprawling franchise back to the us food giant . the terms of the deal were not disclosed by mcdonald's , although a reputation management expert , who has worked on behalf a number of large companies but did not want to speak on the record , said that those outraged by the decision to offer free meals to israeli forces may be "" angry that this deal makes mr padan possibly a very rich man "" . they might be pleased though , about the effect the boycott has had . mr padan's departure comes after mcdonald's said that the israel-gaza conflict had "" meaningfully impacted "" performance in some overseas markets in the fourth quarter of 2023 . for the unit that includes the middle east , china and india , sales growth stood at 0.7 % in the fourth quarter of 2023 - far below market expectations . at the start of the year , mcdonald's chief executive chris kempczinski blamed the backlash on "" misinformation "" . the boycott was also described as "" disheartening and ill-founded "" by the firm , which relies on thousands of independent businesses to own and operate most of its more than 40,000 stores around the world . about 5 % are located in the middle east . the brand management expert said : "" i get it . they are buying back the franchises to regain control but i'm not sure they have . "" they also questioned where the company might draw a line : "" does this mean [ mcdonald's ] will now need to act and offer deals in other areas where reputational damage has been caused ? "" on thursday , mcdonald's said that it "" remains committed to the israeli market and to ensuring a positive employee and customer experience in the market going forward . "" it also thanked alonyal for building the brand in israel , while mr padan said : "" we are encouraged by what the future holds . "" bbc news did not receive further comment from mr padan or alonyal through mcdonald's .",us military ship heading to gaza to build port

"" think of the gaza strip as one layer for civilians and then another layer for hamas . we are trying to get to that second layer that hamas has built , "" idf spokesperson jonathan conricus said in october . hamas has previously said that its tunnel network stretches for 500km ( 311 miles ) , although there is no way to independently verify this . we asked the idf how many tunnels , and what proportion of the total tunnel network , they had destroyed . in their reply , they said their forces had "" destroyed a great deal of the terrorist infrastructure in gaza "" . the idf has occasionally shown evidence of hamas tunnels they've uncovered . for example , in november , the idf released video footage of part of a tunnel network underneath the al-shifa hospital in gaza city which it said was being used as a command centre . to try to determine the extent of the overall network uncovered by the israeli forces , bbc verify has reviewed all the idf messages on the social media platform telegram referencing tunnels in gaza , between 7 october 2023 and 26 march 2024 . of these , 198 mentioned the discovery of tunnels , where the army said it had located tunnels or tunnel shafts . another 141 messages claim that a tunnel has been destroyed or dismantled . most of those did not give precise details or specific locations , so it is not possible to corroborate the extent of the network the idf has uncovered or destroyed . the labyrinth beneath gaza is made up of several components , including tunnel routes and rooms of various sizes , as well as the point at which the tunnel meets the surface - these are known as tunnel shafts . of the messages we analysed , 36 referenced striking a total of more than 400 tunnel shafts . however , equating a shaft with an entire tunnel would be misleading , says dr daphné richemond-barak , an expert on underground warfare who teaches at reichman university in israel . the simple destruction of tunnel shafts leaves the network intact , she says . "" given the scale and depth of hamas's tunnel network , it is impossible to fully eliminate all of its underground military structure , "" she adds . israel's war aims have come at an immense cost to palestinians in gaza . more than 33,000 people have been killed , according to the hamas-run health ministry . the ministry's latest demographic breakdown from 5 april indicates more than 70 % of those killed were women and children . many others have been displaced and left homeless as israeli forces attempt to destroy hamas infrastructure . over 1.7 million people have been internally displaced , according to the united nations . residential areas have been left ruined , bustling streets reduced to rubble , universities destroyed and farmlands churned up . more than 56 % of gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed since 7 october , according to satellite data analysis . six months since the war began , it is still unclear whether israel has met its aims in the war . additional reporting by rob england , maryam ahmed , jamie ryan and emma pengelly . clarification 9 april : we originally quoted dr daphné richemond-barak as saying : "" i don't think we've seen a lot of full destruction of tunnels in this war . "" however , she was specifically referring to the destruction of tunnels using water . we've subsequently amended this article to include a more relevant quote from her about the difficulty of fully destroying the hamas tunnel network . what do you want bbc verify to investigate ?",israel-gaza war : biden unveils israeli proposal to end conflict
2024-04-06T09:15:19.000Z,BBC,"former prime minister boris johnson has said it is "" shameful "" to call for the uk to end arms sales to israel . three britons were among seven aid workers killed in air strikes in gaza carried out by israel's army on monday . it has led the lib dems , snp and some labour and conservative mps to urge the uk to reassess how it supports israel . the foreign office said it keeps advice on israel's adherence to the law under review , adding that this is confidential . writing in his daily mail column , mr johnson said it would be "" insane "" for the uk to end military support , which he said would be "" willing the military defeat of israel and the victory of hamas "" . mr johnson , a former foreign secretary , wrote : "" remember that in order to win this conflict , hamas only has to survive . all they need at the end is to hang on , rebuild , and go again .

2024-04-07T04:49:36.000Z,BBC,"six months after the hamas attacks on israel , war , disease , starvation and death ravage palestinians in gaza . israel is deeply divided , as its prime minister struggles to keep his promise of total victory . the united states , israel's most essential ally , has turned against the way it is fighting the war . with iran vowing vengeance for israel's assassination of a leading iranian general in syria , and months of cross-border conflict with iran's ally hezbollah in lebanon , the risks of an all-out middle east war are increasing . the statistics record the horrors of the past six months . more than 33,000 gazans , a majority of whom were civilians , have been killed , according to the health ministry . according to save the children , 13,800 palestinian children in gaza have been killed and over 12,009 wounded . unicef reports at least 1,000 children have had one or both legs amputated . about 1,200 people , mostly civilians , were killed by hamas on 7 october , and 253 people were taken into gaza as hostages . israel says that of 130 hostages still there , at least 34 are dead . a un team reported in march that it had "" clear and convincing information "" that hostages had been subjected to sexual violence "" including rape , sexualised torture , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment "" . it said there were "" reasonable grounds "" to believe that the violence against hostages was continuing . kibbutz nir oz is right on israel's border with gaza . it feels like a time capsule still stuck in the horrors of 7 october 2023 . just after first light on that morning , hamas broke through the wire . by the time the israeli army arrived in the early afternoon , a quarter of the 400 or so israelis who lived there had either been killed by hamas or taken hostage . ron bahat showed me around . he is a man in his 50s who grew up at nir oz . ron survived with his family through good luck and arms strong enough to hold shut the door of the safe room when hamas entered his house . we walked along the neat lines of small houses , with gardens that are now overgrown . many had bullet holes or were burnt out and had not been disturbed since the bodies of the dead were recovered . ron pointed out the homes of friends and neighbours who were killed or taken as captives to gaza . in one badly damaged house , a pile of neatly ironed children's clothes had somehow survived the fire . the family who lived there did not . one grim irony is that nir oz is part of a left-wing movement whose members traditionally support the idea of peace with the palestinians . six months after hamas crossed into nir oz , ron is not ready to make any concessions to gaza . "" look , i wish that there will be a leader to bring some prosperity there , because in the end we must have peace . but anyone who supports hamas is an enemy . the moment they leave their weapons , the war will stop . the moment that israel leaves its weapons , we will not exist . that's the difference . "" in nir oz , broken glass still crunches underfoot and gutted houses smell of burnt wood and plastic . no-one is there to clean it up . a few of the surviving residents have come back on short visits , but most are staying away , living in hotels in central israel . yamit avital was back for a few hours , showing around a friend . on that morning in october , she had been staying in tel aviv . her husband was at home and escaped with the children . his brother , living not far away , was killed . yamit's hands shook slightly when she was talking about coming back to live in nir oz again . "" i don't know , it's too earlyâ_x0080_ ¦ maybe only when the hostages come back we can start to think about it . we can't think about it now . i have too many friends there , in gaza . "" no-one has been able to show me around the ruins of khan younis or gaza city , or the tents of around 1.4 million displaced civilians in rafah , in the way ron bahat showed me nir oz . that's because international journalists can't report from gaza , as israel and egypt , in control of the borders , have not allowed them in . the only exception has been invitation-only , highly supervised trips organised by the israel defense forces ( idf ) . i have been on one , to northern gaza in early november . only a month or so into the war , israeli firepower had already reduced the area to a wasteland . evidence is accumulating that both hamas and israel may have committed war crimes . the international court of justice ( icj ) in the hague is investigating israel for "" plausible "" allegations of genocide against the palestinians in a case brought by south africa . the icj cannot try a case against hamas , which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the us and uk , and many others , as it is not a state . israel rejects the charge that it is guilty of genocide . for many of its citizens and supporters it is grotesque and offensive to allege that the state created after nazi germany murdered six million jews in the holocaust is itself committing genocide . one of israel's lawyers , tal becker , told the justices in court in the hague that "" the appalling suffering of civilians , both israeli and palestinian , is first and foremost the result of hamas ' strategy "" . palestinians see the charges through a different lens , shaped by years of military occupation by israel . many palestinians believe israel has already created an apartheid state that denies them the most basic rights . in jerusalem at easter , a prominent palestinian christian political activist , dimitri diliani , told me that "" killing children is killing children . it doesn't matter who is the child that's being killed . it doesn't matter who is doing the killing "" . "" i recognise the holocaust , but that does not mean a green light for israel to commit genocide against my people or any other people . "" the icj's deliberations will take years and israel's accusers will have to prove intent to win their case . war and the deaths of civilians do not add up to genocide on their own . south africa's legal team argues that statements like the one made by israel's defence minister yoav gallant on 9 october show genocidal intent . "" i have ordered a complete siege on the gaza strip . there will be no electricity , no food , no fuel , everything is closed , "" he said after visiting the idf southern command in beersheba . "" we are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly . "" israel was forced by international pressure , especially from washington , to loosen aspects of the blockade that the minister envisaged . the amounts reaching gaza were still grossly inadequate . six months later , gaza is facing imminent famine , according to the integrated food security phase classification ( ipc ) a body backed by governments , the un and aid groups to provide rigorous and apolitical information and analysis in a food emergency . oxfam reports that 300,000 people trapped in the north have lived since january on an average of 245 calories a day - the equivalent of a tin of beans . gaza's humanitarian catastrophe has also been recorded in detail by palestinian journalists , civilians posting on social media , and the international organisations running the aid operation , whose staff are allowed to enter the territory . seven from the world central kitchen ( wck ) , which had been providing millions of meals , were killed by the israeli army on 1 april . their deaths outraged president biden and other western leaders who are staunch allies of israel . their condemnation of the killings left israel even more isolated . israel expects no sympathy from much of the world . but it has come to expect support and understanding from powerful western allies . instead , they have rejected israel's claim it does not impede the movement of relief supplies . president biden extracted unusually rapid concessions from israel , which promised greater humanitarian access to gaza in a statement rushed out in the middle of the night here in jerusalem . perhaps he threatened to attach conditions to the use of american weapons in gaza . the killing of the wck team seems to have been a tipping point for president biden , whose backing for israel has been a constant throughout his long career in politics . supporting israel is still his firm principle , but the us is no longer prepared to turn that into a safety net for benjamin netanyahu and his extremist coalition partners . palestinians ask , with some anger and frustration , why it took the deaths of seven aid workers , including six westerners , to make a difference , after so many thousands of gazans had been killed . aid agencies operating in gaza say the attack on the aid workers was not an isolated incident , but the result of an engrained disregard for the lives of palestinian civilians . president biden's outrage might have been a long time coming but it could create a turning point in the war . over the next month or so , one way of assessing change is simply to count whether israel is killing fewer palestinian civilians , or whether increased food and medical aid can save gaza from famine . another test will be whether mr netanyahu defies american opposition and goes ahead with a ground assault on rafah , where israel says the remaining organised units of hamas must be destroyed . the us says that must not happen until israel can find a way to protect the lives of almost 1.5 million palestinians who have taken refuge there . benjamin netanyahu has delivered the "" mighty vengeance "" he promised israelis on 7 october . his other promises , of total victory , the destruction of hamas , and the return of the hostages have not been achieved . inside israel , he faces severe political pressure . his approval ratings in opinion polls have plummeted . in the past week in jerusalem thousands of protestors waving israeli flags blocked streets around the parliament demanding the resignation of the prime minister and new elections . "" netanyahu has an interest to lengthen the war as much as he can , because as long as the war is still going on , he can say that now is not the time for new elections , "" said nava rosalio , one of the leaders of the anti-netanyahu movement . her group is called busha in hebrew , which translates as shame . "" he says now is not the time to look for who is responsible , which is he . so he prefers to keep the hostages in gaza , and he prefers to lengthen the war . "" when hamas attacked , israel was deeply divided over his government's right-wing policies and culture wars between secular and religious israelis . in the shock that followed reservists who had suspended their military service as part of the protests rushed back into uniform . demonstrations were paused in the interests of national unity . six months on , it is no longer considered unpatriotic to protest against the failure to end the war and free the hostages . israel's divisions are wide open once more . mr netanyahu faces searing accusations that his priority is his own political survival . to stay in power , he must preserve his coalition , which is built around the support of ultranationalist jewish parties . they do not only oppose the mass release of palestinian security prisoners to buy the freedom of israeli hostages , without which a ceasefire will not happen . mr netanyahu's two main ultranationalist allies , finance minister bezalel smotrich and national security minister itamar ben-gvir , go further . they both want palestinians to leave gaza so jews can settle there instead . the prime minister , renowned for his skills in the dark arts of politics , is performing a balancing act to keep them happy while denying that mr smotrich and mr ben-gvir's views reflect government policy . before october , israel's divisions must have made it look vulnerable to hamas . six months on , the same schisms within israel about the present and the future are making it harder to win the war . capturing or killing yahya sinwar , the hamas leader in gaza and mastermind of the 7 october attacks , would give israel a chance to declare victory . but he is still alive , sending his responses to proposals in successive rounds of ceasefire talks from wherever he is hiding . he is thought to be somewhere in the hamas tunnel network , protected by bodyguards and a human shield of israeli hostages . yahya sinwar must be disappointed that palestinians on the west bank , including east jerusalem have not risen up in support of gaza . some must be taking the long view , waiting to see how events unfold in gaza and the wider middle east . others are struggling to feed their families now that thousands of palestinians are no longer allowed to work in israel . some are scared . israel has launched many deadly raids against armed groups in the west bank , killing innocent bystanders in the process and arresting thousands who are being held without trial . some palestinian farmers have been driven off their land after violent and sometimes deadly intimidation by extremist jewish settlers . opinion polls show strong support among palestinians for the attacks on 7 october , though many deny the evidence that hamas committed atrocities . at a noisy demonstration against the israelis in ramallah in the west bank , i asked joharah baker , a palestinian activist , whether the hamas attacks had moved the palestinians any closer to independence from israeli rule . she said that was not the point .

"" according to the leading palestinian pollster , khalil shikaki , even those who dislike hamas approve of the way its attacks have put the palestinian desire for independence back on the political map of the middle east . the war has accelerated a new way for that to happen . his latest polls indicate that younger palestinians do not think the two-state solution of an independent palestine alongside israel will ever emerge . instead , he says , a plurality of under-30s want a single state between the mediterranean sea and the river jordan , in which they believe they could fight and win democratic rights . they compare their fight with the struggle against apartheid in south africa , and believe they have a palestinian nelson mandela waiting in an israeli jail . he is marwan barghouti , imprisoned since 2002 and serving five life sentences for murder . if he ran for president , the indications are that he would win easily . even though he is a leader of the rival palestinian faction , fatah , hamas put marwan barghouti's name on the list of prisoners they want released in exchange for hostages . it is impossible to see jewish israelis ever giving up the jewish nature of their state . the fact that palestinians see that as a possibility is another sign of the distance between them . six months into the war , there is no immediate sign that it is ending . benjamin netanyahu has avoided any specifics about how gaza would be governed when this war ends , except for insisting that israel must be in control - in other words , an occupation . he has rejected america's proposal to replace israeli troops with a force from the palestinian authority , which administers parts of the west bank . the americans want a pa , revitalised , eventually to govern gaza . that would most likely require new leadership . current palestinian president mahmoud abbas is elderly and hugely unpopular . palestinians say he has failed to fight corruption , failed to show sympathy for gaza , and failed to order the palestinian police to protect them from aggressive jewish settlers while he continues security cooperation with israel . benjamin netanyahu has also rejected joe biden's idea of a grand bargain that would transform the middle east . in return for allowing palestinian independence , israel would be recognised by saudi arabia , and the saudis would get a nato-style defence agreement with the us . instead , the prime minister tells israelis that he is the only man who can save them from the mortal hazard of a palestinian state imposed by america . that is music for the ultranationalists in his government , who are much keener to keep the west bank and all of jerusalem than make a deal with saudi arabia . away from the conference rooms where leaders discuss the future , the war has created another enormous obstacle to peace . palestinians and israelis have not been as suspicious of each other since the turbulent decades of assassination , hijackings and war in the 1950s and 60s . the pollster khalil shikaki identifies an accelerated mutual process of dehumanisation since 7 october . "" the palestinians are not seen as partners for peace . they are not seen as people who deserve equality because of what they have done on 7 october . so , they [ israelis ] question their humanity . we see similar developments , unfortunately , also among palestinians , who see what is happening in gaza . "" and they say those who are targeting women and children , deliberately killing entire families , demolishing entire neighbourhoods cannot be humans as well . so , they see them as monsters .

2024-04-09T09:53:10.000Z,BBC,"the israeli troop withdrawal from gaza announced on sunday was greeted with widespread surprise , even as the israeli army and government have been at pains to stress that it has no great significance . but to a world that has watched the intensity of israel's bombardment , the idea that there was now just one brigade left in the entire enclave seemed to signify some major shift in the war . and then there was the timing of the announcement - on the very day that marked the grim milestone of six months since the hamas-led assault on israel ignited this latest and bloodiest phase in the conflict between israel and the palestinians . "" don't read too much into it , "" a spokesperson for the israeli prime minister's office told journalists the next day . avi hyman stressed how small the distances involved are and that the israel defense forces ( idf ) would therefore continue to be able to take whatever action it deemed necessary , with or without troops stationed inside gaza . as if to prove the point - just hours later , the israeli army said it "" eliminated "" a senior hamas operative , hatem al-ghamri , in an air strike . the israeli media has , however , responded very differently . in the widely read and right-wing israel hayom , the paper's diplomatic correspondent ariel kahana tied the troop withdrawal to pressure on the israeli government to agree a ceasefire deal with hamas in the latest round of talks . "" the formal reasons offered by israeli spokespersons for halting the war were operational in nature , but every intelligent person can see that the timing is hardly coincidental . ahead of critical talks , the israeli capitulation was designed - without saying so explicitly - to signal to hamas that israel was being very forthcoming with it from its perspective . "" ben caspit in the more centrist maariv newspaper was even more forceful in his interpretation of the move . "" if you were to ask netanyahu ( and he was asked ) , this was done to prepare for the promised operation in rafah … there is a second explanation , one that has been reported all over the world in every possible language . by that account , the 98th division's withdrawal from khan yunis is linked to talks for a hostage deal . "" serious media outlets around the world have reported that the conversation between president biden and prime minister netanyahu was dramatic . biden led netanyahu to understand that he wasn't a pace away from victory , but a pace away from the final destruction of the alliance between israel and the united states . "" in public at least , mr netanyahu has continued to ratchet up the rhetoric on rafah , saying that a date has been set for the operation . his defence minister , yoav gallant , has been more nuanced , telling army recruits that now is an "" opportune "" time to do a deal with hamas . but he stressed that a ceasefire would not be the end of the war : "" there will be difficult decisions and we will be ready to pay the price in order to get the hostages back , and then return to fighting . "" the fighting is likely to continue , as mr gallant says , but the form it takes may change substantially . with criticism of the way the war has been conducted growing from israel's most powerful ally , the us , the drawing down of forces in gaza seems likely in part to be aimed at showing the biden administration that israel is listening to its concerns over civilian casualties and life-threatening aid shortages . an end to bombardments that have reduced cities to rubble , as has been seen in the latest images from khan younis , may go some way to restoring the customary whole-hearted support for israel from washington . but that will undoubtedly be tested again , if the "" future operations "" that the israeli army says troops are being given rest and recuperation to prepare for means a full-scale assault on rafah where israel believes hamas's remaining military forces are now based , among more than a million displaced palestinians . there may be a belief in the israeli government and military that a significant number of that population , squeezed into barely functioning shelters , may start moving back to their homes now that the bulk of israeli troops is gone . but what palestinians have found on their return to khan younis is mass devastation , with many of their homes reduced to rubble . they have described how gaza's second city is now unliveable , not even fit for animals , as some have put it . meanwhile , the head of the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa , warned palestinians thinking of heading to khan younis about the threat of unexploded munitions there following the israeli pullout . philippe lazzarini told the bbc there might be thousands of the devices in the rubble . so a major exodus from rafah , which would make any israeli operation against hamas less likely to cause a new catastrophic toll of civilian casualties , may not be on the cards . but the "" further operations "" may also relate to the conflict on israel's northern front with hezbollah in lebanon . that confrontation has been steadily escalating since 7 october . and there are fears that it could become far more intense , following the suspected israeli strike in damascus that killed several senior commanders in iran's powerful revolutionary guards last week . hezbollah is closely allied to iran and has matched the rhetoric coming from tehran , vowing revenge . the israeli army has recently said that it has substantially strengthened its northern command . so , this too may have played a part in the troop withdrawal from gaza . whatever the true motives were - and they are likely to have involved a number of interlocking factors - it is unlikely that israel's military engagement in gaza is anywhere close to coming to an end , with hamas fighters already having shown their capacity to regroup in areas that had been subjected to the heaviest onslaught from the idf .",israel reveals eurovision song after weeks of wrangling

2024-04-09T20:09:41.000Z,BBC,"a truce between israel and the palestinian group hamas in gaza was never going to be easy . weeks of talks have failed to produce agreement . but international pressure is growing . perhaps the biggest sign is the biden administration sending william burns , the head of the cia , for the latest round of talks in cairo . hamas has , in public at least , stuck with its initial demands of a permanent ceasefire , the complete withdrawal of israeli troops and the return of displaced palestinians to northern parts of the territory without restrictions . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu meanwhile insists that israel will continue fighting until hamas is destroyed and hostages the group is holding are free . "" there's a lot more american pressure on israel , and on egypt and qatar to put pressure on hamas . that's obvious , "" said gershon baskin , who helped negotiate a deal with hamas for the release of israeli soldier gilad shalit in 2011 . "" the fact that the head of the cia showed up , which required all the negotiators to be there at the highest level . that's indicative of increased american pressure . "" but that does not mean a deal is at hand . israeli officials have indicated willingness to make some concessions amid intensifying frustration among the country's main allies , including the us . earlier this week , the israeli defence minister , yoav gallant , suggested that now was the right time for a truce . any deal is expected to see the release of some of the hostages captured in the hamas attacks in return for palestinian prisoners being held in israeli jails , which was the basis for a truce that led to a temporary pause in hostilities in november . according to israeli authorities , 133 people remain captive in gaza , although at least 30 have already been confirmed dead . under the latest us proposal , an initial phase of a six-week ceasefire would see hamas release 40 hostages who are alive , with the priority being given to female captives including soldiers , men over the age of 50 and those with serious medical conditions . israel would then release at least 700 palestinians , including about 100 who are serving life sentences for killing israelis , which has proved controversial in israel in the past . but hamas has reportedly told negotiators it is not holding 40 people in this category , raising the prospect that many more hostages than previously thought have died or that they could be in the hands of other armed groups , such as palestinian islamic jihad . in israel , mr netanyahu's room for manoeuvre is limited by pressure from different parts of society and politics . while most of the israeli public remain supportive of the war , there are growing calls for him to agree to a deal for the release of the hostages . the families have held large protests , accusing the prime minister of not making the captives ' return a priority and of being more concerned with his own political survival . calls for mr netanyahu to resign are on the rise too . divisions have intensified within mr netanyahu's governing coalition , which includes far-right , ultranationalist allies who refuse concessions to hamas and insist the war must go on . finance minister bezalel smotrich told the prime minister that increasing pressure on hamas was the only way to bring the hostages back and destroy the group , while national security minister itamar ben gvir explicitly threatened to bring down mr netanyahu himself if he did not go ahead with a much-promised offensive into the city of rafah , in southern gaza . israeli officials insist it is essential to enter rafah , where , they say , hamas has four operational brigades and its senior leaders could be hiding . but virtually everyone outside israel is against an offensive in the city , where about 1.5 million palestinians are sheltering in tents , improvised shelters and overcrowded camps , over concerns of the catastrophic impact it could have on civilians . in what could have been an attempt to counter domestic criticism , on monday , mr netanyahu said a date had already been set for a rafah operation , without giving details . "" there's a revolt going on right now in the government , and within [ mr netanyahu's party ] likud , against netanyahu making any kind of deal that they don't think should be made , "" mr baskin said . "" netanyahu is not a free actor . he's a hostage himself within his own government . "" for its part hamas has yet to give a formal response to the latest proposal , but said that while it was interested in an agreement "" that puts an end to the aggression on our people "" , the offer did not meet its demands . "" the israeli position remains intransigent , "" the group said in a statement . the white house described the group's response as "" less than encouraging "" . a final decision will probably be made by yahya sinwar , the hamas leader in gaza who is thought to be hiding in tunnels surrounded by guards and hostages . but communications with him are difficult and said to involve several intermediaries and take days . the group , mr baskin said , was also demanding more say in which palestinian prisoners would be released and that it would not agree to any of them being deported to another country , issues that could present obstacles to negotiations . hamas also believes that without guarantees of a permanent ceasefire , israel will continue to attack the group once the hostages are released . its leadership has witnessed growing international criticism of israel and may believe time is on their side to secure concessions , despite the overwhelming and immediate needs of gaza's devastated civilian population . the war in gaza , israel's response to the hamas attacks on 7 october that killed about 1,200 people , has killed more than 33,000 palestinians , according to the hamas-run health ministry , destroyed large parts of the territory , and left many on the brink of famine . "" from my experience in dealing with these things , the main difficulties are whether or not the main decision maker on both sides is ready for a deal . that's not clear , "" mr baskin said . "" it's not clear that netanyahu is ready for a deal , it's not clear that [ hamas political leader in gaza yahya ] sinwar is ready for a deal . but when they are , they will find the middle ground .

"" we're going to do all we can to protect israel's security , "" he added . earlier on wednesday , iran's leader said the attack in damascus was equivalent to an attack on iran itself .

"" the evil regime must be punished , and it will be punished . "" it is unclear what form any reprisal attack would take . for iran to strike israel directly would risk an even greater escalation in the conflict , and analysts have said iran does not have the military capability for a significant confrontation . a possible alternative is an attack via an iranian proxy like hezbollah , which has traded fire with israel across the border from lebanon almost daily since 8 october . those exchanges have intensified in recent weeks . "" hezbollah is very capable , hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles there , on the border that can reach all the way into southern israel , "" joe buccino , former communications director at the us military's central command , told the bbc .

2024-04-14T08:54:04.000Z,BBC,"for the first time ever , iran has carried out strikes against israeli territory . in the middle of saturday night , air raid alerts went off in israel . residents were urged to seek shelter , while explosions were heard as air defences were activated . interceptions lit up the night sky in several places across the country , with many drones and missiles shot down by israel and its allies before they reached israeli territory . there is even thought to be at least one case of a ballistic missile being shot down outside the earth's atmosphere . at least nine countries were involved in the military escalation - with projectiles fired from iran , iraq , syria and yemen and downed by israel , the us , the uk and jordan . here's what we know about what was fired at israel and what was intercepted . iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles towards israel , the israeli military said on sunday . the attack included 170 drones and 30 cruise missiles , none of which entered israeli territory , and at least 110 ballistic missiles , of which a small number reached israel , military spokesman rear adm daniel hagari said in a televised statement . the bbc has not independently verified those figures . the shortest distance from iran to israel is about 1,000km ( 620 miles ) across iraq , syria and jordan . on saturday night , iran's revolutionary guards corps ( irgc ) said it had launched drones and missiles . iraqi security sources told reuters that projectiles were seen flying over iraq in the direction of israel . the irgc said ballistic missiles were fired almost an hour after the slower-moving drones , so that they would strike israel at roughly the same time . the us defence department said us forces intercepted dozens of missiles and drones launched from iran , iraq , syria and yemen . the iran-backed hezbollah group in lebanon also said it had fired two barrages of rockets at an israeli military base in the occupied golan heights , a plateau which israel has annexed from syria , in a move not recognised by most of the international community . some 99 % of the incoming barrage was intercepted either outside israeli airspace or over the country itself , rear adm hagari said . they included all the drones and cruise missiles , which follow a flat trajectory , and most of the ballistic missiles , which are fired on an arcing trajectory that uses gravity to reach very high speeds . since most of the projectiles came from relatively far away , israel was able to send f-35 stealth fighters to intercept them . the idf said that 25 of the 30 cruise missiles sent by iran were shot down outside the country . for anything that got past this first line of defence , israel used its aerial defense array -

2024-04-14T08:54:04.000Z,BBC,"for the first time ever , iran has carried out strikes against israeli territory . in the middle of saturday night , air raid alerts went off in israel . residents were urged to seek shelter , while explosions were heard as air defences were activated . interceptions lit up the night sky in several places across the country , with many drones and missiles shot down by israel and its allies before they reached israeli territory . there is even thought to be at least one case of a ballistic missile being shot down outside the earth's atmosphere . at least nine countries were involved in the military escalation - with projectiles fired from iran , iraq , syria and yemen and downed by israel , the us , the uk and jordan . here's what we know about what was fired at israel and what was intercepted . iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles towards israel , the israeli military said on sunday . the attack included 170 drones and 30 cruise missiles , none of which entered israeli territory , and at least 110 ballistic missiles , of which a small number reached israel , military spokesman rear adm daniel hagari said in a televised statement . the bbc has not independently verified those figures . the shortest distance from iran to israel is about 1,000km ( 620 miles ) across iraq , syria and jordan . on saturday night , iran's revolutionary guards corps ( irgc ) said it had launched drones and missiles . iraqi security sources told reuters that projectiles were seen flying over iraq in the direction of israel . the irgc said ballistic missiles were fired almost an hour after the slower-moving drones , so that they would strike israel at roughly the same time . the us defence department said us forces intercepted dozens of missiles and drones launched from iran , iraq , syria and yemen . the iran-backed hezbollah group in lebanon also said it had fired two barrages of rockets at an israeli military base in the occupied golan heights , a plateau which israel has annexed from syria , in a move not recognised by most of the international community . some 99 % of the incoming barrage was intercepted either outside israeli airspace or over the country itself , rear adm hagari said . they included all the drones and cruise missiles , which follow a flat trajectory , and most of the ballistic missiles , which are fired on an arcing trajectory that uses gravity to reach very high speeds . since most of the projectiles came from relatively far away , israel was able to send f-35 stealth fighters to intercept them . the idf said that 25 of the 30 cruise missiles sent by iran were shot down outside the country . for anything that got past this first line of defence , israel used its aerial defense array - the three-tier umbrella of missile defence systems in place since 7 october - apparently to good effect . the highest tier is arrow , used to physically intercept long-range projectiles . it is thought that arrow dealt with most of the ballistic missiles aimed at israel . dramatic footage which appears to show one of these missiles being shot down outside the earth's atmosphere suggests that arrow 3 -

including 170 explosive drones , 30 cruise missiles and 120 ballistic missiles - but israel has said very little damage had been done . israel defense forces ( idf ) spokesman rear adm daniel hagari said some iranian missiles had hit inside israel , causing minor damage to a military base but no casualties . he said a 10-year-old bedouin girl had been severely injured by shrapnel from falling debris in the southern arad region . world leaders will be considering their response to the major escalation in tensions between israel and iran , with many condemning the attack or warning of the dangers of escalation . mr biden said he would convene "" my fellow g7 leaders to co-ordinate a united diplomatic response to iran's brazen attack "" . the un security council will also hold an emergency meeting later , its president vanessa frazier said . un secretary general antónio guterres issued a statement saying he "" strongly condemn[ed ] the serious escalation represented by the large-scale attack launched on israel "" by iran . he called for "" an immediate cessation of these hostilities "" and for all sides to exercise maximum restraint . uk prime minister rishi sunak called the strikes "" reckless "" , while the european union's foreign affairs chief josep borrell said it was a "" grave threat to regional security "" . china's foreign ministry urged restraint , characterising it as "" the latest spillover of the gaza conflict "" , while russia's foreign ministry expressed "" extreme concern over another dangerous escalation "" . on sunday , france recommended its citizens in iran should temporarily leave the country due to the risk of military escalation . speaking to crowds at the vatican on sunday , pope francis made a "" heartfelt appeal for a halt to any action that could fuel a spiral of violence with the risk of dragging the middle east into an even greater conflict "" . there have been increased tensions in the middle east since the 7 october hamas attacks on israel , in which about 1,200 people , mostly civilians , were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage . the subsequent israeli military operation in gaza has killed 33,729 people , mostly civilians , according to the hamas-run health ministry . meanwhile israel's spy agency mossad said hamas negotiators had rejected the most recent proposal put forward by mediators in peace talks . in a statement it said this proved hamas ' gaza leader yahya sinwar "" does not want a humanitarian deal and the return of the hostages "" and was "" continuing to exploit the tension with iran "" . on saturday , hamas said it stood by its demand for a permanent ceasefire in the gaza war , a complete israeli withdrawal from the gaza strip , a return of palestinians displaced by the fighting to their homes , and increased humanitarian aid to the territory .",world central kitchen founder josé andrés says israel targeted staff in gaza ' car by car '

it will only escalate further if it is attacked again . the iranians seem to want to cool the two weeks of crisis and threats that started with the israeli strike on their diplomatic compound in damascus . perhaps iran was hoping to do more damage than it did . or it may have been open about its plans to give israel less reason to hit back . iran wanted to restore the sense of deterrence it lost when israel attacked the compound in damascus . that might be harder after israel and its allies stopped almost all the projectiles launched their way . it was not a full-scale attack on israel . iran has been building up its rocket and missile forces for years . it could have fired many more weapons . hezbollah in lebanon would have joined in with an all-out offensive , and it did not . the lebanese militia and political movement is iran's strongest ally , with an arsenal of rockets and missiles . prime minister netanyahu might draw some satisfaction with the way that the iran attack removed gaza from the headlines . it gives him a respite from the humanitarian catastrophe , and israel's failure to achieve its war aims of freeing the hostages and crushing hamas . a few days ago , international focus was on the rift between mr biden and mr netanyahu over the famine created by israel's blockade of gaza . now they talk about unity . mr netanyahu can also present himself as a resolute and reasonable leader , the protector of his people even though his many enemies in israel want him out of office . they say his rash , unsafe policies before 7 october led hamas to believe israel was vulnerable . what has not changed is that the americans want to find a way to stop the slide to an all-out middle east war . red lines have been crossed - israel's attack on a diplomatic site , and iran's direct attack on israel . immediately , some israeli right-wingers demanded a response . those calls will not stop . the job of the diplomats at the g7 will be to prevent the region entering a damaging wider conflict . the slide has been slow , but also steady and in one direction , towards disaster , in the six months since hamas attacked israel . if israel takes president biden's advice not to hit back , the middle east might be able to take a breath . it is by no means certain that this is the end of this dangerous episode .",' we're living on duty free ' say tourists stranded in dubai - bbc news

"" many iranians also see the iran-israel confrontation now emerging from the shadows as being orchestrated by the iranian government rather than reflective of the will of the iranian people . this perception is underscored by a heavy police presence on the streets of tehran - ostensibly about enforcing strict islamic dress codes requiring women to cover their hair but which many suspect is mainly about crushing any possible protests . some decision-makers fear that if iranian security forces and the irgc's command centres are hit in a war with israel and the us , this could reignite nationwide protests that erupted in 2022 after the death of a young woman in police custody . some graffiti has appeared on walls in iranian cities - "" israel , strike the supreme leader's [ ayatollah ali khamenei's ] house , "" reads one .

2024-04-16T21:55:31.000Z,BBC,"apple has released a partial update to its iphone software which stops the palestinian flag emoji being suggested when users type the word "" jerusalem "" . the issue had sparked controversy , with critics noting the names of other cities do not prompt flag emojis to appear . both israel and the palestinians hold competing claims to the ancient city . apple previously told the bbc the flag's appearance when jerusalem was typed had been inadvertent . the issue , according to apple , related to unintended behaviour in a feature called predictive emoji . iphones can suggest emojis when words are typed in messages , and other apps . users noticed the flag started being suggested after the company rolled out ios 17.4.1 - the latest publicly available version of the software on which its mobile devices run . critics such as tv presenter rachel riley had demanded apple explain why the flag appeared , particularly when other cities do not produce flag emojis when typed . "" showing double standards with respect to israel is a form of antisemitism , "" she wrote on social media . apple's apparent resolution is currently only in the "" developer beta "" version of ios 17.5 released on tuesday . the apple developer programme allows programmers building apps to sign up for early releases of the software - called beta versions - so they can test out apps they are building on them . in the new update no emoji is suggested when a user types "" jerusalem "" , in line with what happens with other cities . it's not clear when the update will be released more widely , either as a public beta , or as an finished update to the general public . the status of jerusalem is one of the thorniest disputes in the conflict between israel and the palestinians . israel sees the whole of jerusalem as its eternal , undivided capital , while palestinians claim the eastern part as the capital of their hoped-for future state . east jerusalem , along with the west bank and gaza strip , were captured by israel from jordan and egypt in a war in 1967 . they have since been viewed internationally as occupied palestinian territory . there have been increased tensions in the middle east since the 7 october hamas attacks on israel , in which about 1,200 people , mostly civilians , were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage . the subsequent israeli military operation in gaza has killed 33,729 people , mostly civilians , according to the hamas-run health ministry .",israel military sacks senior officers after aid workers killed in gaza - bbc news
2024-04-17T00:52:58.000Z,BBC,"iran's brazen attack directly targeting israel on saturday means that the one thing president biden most feared and desperately sought to avert in the wake of the 7 october hamas attack has happened - an escalation of the conflict to the wider region . for the us president , the tightrope he was walking on the israel-gaza war has got even thinner , as he seeks to both de-escalate the situation and deter iran , while facing domestic pressure from both left and right over the relationship with israel . any ceasefire deal in gaza , meanwhile , hangs in the balance . just two weeks ago , it appeared that the us-israel relationship - once the closest of close allies - was in serious trouble . president biden was expressing not just frustration but also outright anger at the lack of humanitarian aid getting into gaza and the killing of seven aid workers in a strike by the israel defense forces . the level of disagreement was such that the administration made clear it could reconsider its stance towards israel , and possibly even withhold arms exports . but iran's action at the weekend seems to have changed all that . the barrage of more than 300 missiles and drones fired at israel prompted a highly successful , hand-in-glove military action by the us and israel to defend the country . the co-ordinated action has seemingly rekindled some of the old warmth . and the white house will now be hoping it can capitalise on that to influence israel's response . officials are not so naive as to think there will be no response at all , but they want it calibrated in such a way that it can be viewed as an act of restraint . but the weekend's joint military success also masks a fundamental and worrying change in the regional situation , according to former us envoy dennis ross , a 40-year veteran of us diplomacy in the middle east . iran's direct retaliation against israeli territory for the targeting of its elite quds force officers in a strike on the iranian consulate in syria has "" rewritten the rules "" of the israel-iran relationship , he says , further destabilising an already precarious situation . iran has spent years building up proxy forces sworn to israel's destruction , while funding and arming palestinian groups including hamas , as well as the shia militant group hezbollah in lebanon . but saturday marked the first time since the islamic revolution in 1979 that iran has attempted to launch a direct attack on israel . and so , no matter how you spin the success of the military technology that effectively neutralised iran's actions , a rubicon has been crossed . that , says mr ross , means there was a "" failure of deterrents "" towards iran . mr biden now faces an uncomfortable paradox , he says . the president has to simultaneously lower the temperature with iran , but at the same time , make tehran understand there is a cost to its actions . in the wake of saturday's attack , the white house made clear it would not join any israeli military retaliation against iran , while asserting its commitment to israel's security remained "" ironclad "" . iran's direct involvement in the current war will also make reaching a ceasefire deal in gaza and the release of hostages kidnapped by hamas significantly harder . american diplomats have been working around the clock to get israel to agree to a six-week pause in fighting to allow for the release of both hostages from gaza and palestinian prisoners in israeli jails . the agreement would also facilitate the movement of desperately needed aid into gaza , where starvation is looming . before the weekend , they had israel's buy-in and the pressure was on hamas . all that is now in jeopardy as the world waits to see how israel will respond . the domestic complications for the president are meanwhile ever present . there's pressure from parts of the left to distance himself from israel ; and accusations from the right of weakness in not standing up to iran forcefully enough . "" i understand that in an election year . one wants to keep things contained . it's perfectly understandable , "" says mr ross , who played a key role in the middle east peace process in both the george hw bush and clinton administrations . "" but by the same token , we have an iran that took a step that it hadn't taken before . and by taking that step it is showing a readiness to cross certain thresholds and the more they cross certain thresholds , they get more used to doing that . and the region becomes far more dangerous as a result . "" all this of course is ripe with the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation . one misstep could set off a chain reaction that could quickly spiral out of control . the region is a notorious tinderbox and could catch light even further at any time . the world is holding its breath .",who were the world central kitchen workers killed in gaza ?
2024-04-17T01:07:11.000Z,BBC,"the united states and the european union say they are looking at imposing further sanctions on iran , after its attack on israel at the weekend . us treasury secretary janet yellen said she expected to take action "" in the coming days "" , while eu foreign policy chief josep borrell said the bloc was working on it . israel has urged its allies to sanction tehran's missile programme . united nations sanctions over the programme expired in october . those sanctions had been linked to a wider deal to limit iran's nuclear programme . however a number of countries including the us , eu and uk maintained sanctions and added new ones . the israeli military's chief of staff , lt gen herzi halevi , said on monday that the iranian attack would not go unanswered . iran's first-ever direct attack on israel on saturday saw a wave of more than 300 missiles and drones fired from iran , iraq , syria and yemen , with most being downed by israel and its allies . tehran said the attack was retaliation for a presumed israeli air strike on its consulate in syria on 1 april , in which 13 people were killed . so far , israel appears to have countered with only a diplomatic offensive . its foreign minister urged more than 30 countries to impose sanctions on iran's missile programme . it has also called for the islamic revolutionary guard corps ( irgc ) - a major military , political and economic force in iran - to be designated a terrorist organisation , something the us has already done but the uk has not . speaking on tuesday , us treasury secretary ms yellen said : "" with respect to sanctions , i fully expect that we will take additional sanctions action against iran in the coming days . "" we don't preview our sanctions tools . but in discussions i've had , all options to disrupt terrorist financing of iran continue to be on the table . "" she said iran's oil exports were "" a possible area we could address "" , adding : "" clearly , iran is continuing to export some oil . there may be more that we could do . "" ms yellen said the us was already using financial sanctions to isolate iran and disrupt its ability to fund proxy groups and support russia's war in ukraine - including by targeting more than 500 individuals and entities . existing us sanctions on iran already ban nearly all american trade with the country . us national security advisor jake sullivan said later that the new sanctions would target "" iran including its missile and drone program "" as well as the revolutionary guards and the iranian defence ministry . "" we anticipate that our allies and partners will soon be following with their own sanctions , "" he added . "" these new sanctions and other measures will continue a steady drumbeat of pressure to contain and degrade iran's military capacity and effectiveness and confront the full range of its problematic behaviours . "" mr borrell , the eu's top diplomat , said some member states had asked for sanctions against iran to be expanded . he said he would send a request to the eu's diplomatic service to "" start the necessary work related to the sanctions "" . israeli foreign minister israel katz welcomed the "" positive trend towards the adoption of sanctions "" in a post on x , formerly twitter . world leaders have urged restraint in a bid to avoid a major escalation in the middle east , following the latest attack . us president joe biden - who has repeatedly declared his support for israel is "" ironclad "" - has said he believes israel should declare victory in this episode and "" take the win "" . in a phone call on tuesday evening , uk prime minister rishi sunak warned israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu against a further escalation in its response . "" he stressed that significant escalation was in no one's interest and would only deepen insecurity in the middle east . this was a moment for calm heads to prevail , "" a downing street spokesperson said . the g7 group of the world's seven largest advanced economies was now "" co-ordinating a diplomatic response "" , they added . iran has indicated that it deems the matter "" concluded "" unless israel retaliates - with iran's president ebrahim raisi warning that "" the slightest action against iran's interests will definitely be met with a severe , extensive and painful response "" . russia - an ally of iran - has also urged restraint , the kremlin said on tuesday following a call between russian president vladimir putin and president raisi .

"" it's in no-one's interest that we see escalation and that is what we said very clearly to all the people i've been speaking to here in israel . "" after the meeting , the israeli prime minister said : "" i want to make it clear - we will make our own decisions , and the state of israel will do everything necessary to defend itself . "" mr netanyahu's remarks will reinforce the belief in western capitals that israel is set to take action against iran and there is a limit to how often they can call for restraint . israel is more than aware of concerns in europe and the united states about the war escalating in the region . however , western leaders may take comfort from the fact that israeli leaders are trying to exploit the diplomatic support they have gained after iran's attacks , which has seen international condemnation and the promise of new sanctions on tehran . it is possible mr netanyahu may not want to destroy that alliance with an act of retaliation that plunges the region into a full-scale war . lord cameron is one of several western foreign ministers who are expected to visit israel in the coming days as part of a diplomatic drive to prevent that from happening . before meeting mr netanyahu , lord cameron held talks with israeli president isaac herzog and israeli foreign affairs minister israel katz . the uk foreign secretary also visited the occupied palestinian territories to meet mohammad mustafa , the prime minister of the palestinian authority . g7 ministers are gathering in italy , where lord cameron will push for co-ordinated sanctions on iran . earlier , he accused tehran of being "" behind so much of the malign activity "" in the middle east and called for other countries to adopt measures designed to restrict iran's influence . the us and european union are considering further sanctions , and israel is calling on its allies to designate the islamic revolutionary guard corps ( irgc ) - a major military , political and economic force in iran - as a terrorist organisation . the israeli government has repeatedly vowed to retaliate after iran sent more than 300 drones and missiles towards israel in an unprecedented direct attack overnight on saturday . almost all the projectiles were intercepted by israel's air defence systems , with the help of the uk , us , france , and jordan . iran's direct attack on israel was carried out in response to a strike in syria on 1 april which killed senior iranian military figures . israel has not publicly confirmed it was behind the attack , but is widely believed to have been . on tuesday evening , uk prime minister rishi sunak spoke to mr netanyahu and warned that "" significant escalation will only deepen instability in the region "" , adding : "" this is a moment for calm heads to prevail . "" lord cameron will seek to reinforce mr sunak's call for restraint during his visit to israel , and put more pressure on its leaders to do more to allow humanitarian aid into gaza - but he is walking a delicate diplomatic line . the foreign secretary will not want to appear to be hectoring an ally which has just been subject to an unprecedented attack on its soil . that is why lord cameron is also talking about the need for hamas to release hostages and the importance of western powers imposing yet more sanctions on iran . his presence in jerusalem is a show of support and solidarity - but also an attempt to warn israeli leaders that any significant escalation would be against their interests and the world's .",israel crisis deepens over ultra-orthodox draft

"" she remains in custody , "" she added . the police have not commented , but it comes after they launched a crackdown on breaches of the islamic dress code . tehran's police chief said on saturday the new initiative would "" confront social taboo-breaking over hijab and chastity and those who seek to expressly contravene hijab rules "" - a reference to the many women and girls who have defiantly stopped covering their hair in public . in another development on thursday , video posted on social media appeared to show a young iranian woman having a seizure after she was confronted by morality police in tehran . an eyewitness told bbc persian that officers violently confiscated the woman's mobile phone and purse because she was not wearing a headscarf . nika shakarami became a symbol of the "" woman , life , freedom "" protest movement that shook the islamic republic two years ago . the protests erupted in response to the death in custody on 16 september 2022 of mahsa amini , a 22-year-old woman who had been detained by morality police in the capital for allegedly wearing her hijab "" improperly "" . authorities denied that mahsa amini was mistreated , but the un's independent international fact-finding mission on iran said in a report last month that she "" was subjected to physical violence that led to her death "" . on 20 september 2022 , nika was filmed at a protest in tehran setting fire to her headscarf , while other protesters chanted "" death to the dictator "" - a reference to the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei . she disappeared that evening after telling a friend that she was being chased by police . her family eventually found her body at a mortuary 10 days later . they alleged that she died from blows to the head and rejected claims from officials that she had killed herself . authorities portrayed the protests as foreign-backed "" riots "" and tried to suppress them with force . they have not released an official death toll , but the un's fact-finding mission said credible figures suggested that as many as 551 protesters were killed by security forces , most of them by gunfire . the government says 75 security personnel were killed . more than 20,000 other protesters were reportedly detained , including many journalists and celebrities . nine young men have been executed in connection with the protests following what un investigators found were summary proceedings that relied on confessions extracted under torture and ill-treatment . dozens more have reportedly been sentenced to death or charged with capital offences . the protests have now largely subsided , but there is still widespread discontent at the clerical establishment and , in particular , the hijab laws . in september , iran's parliament passed a controversial "" hijab and chastity "" bill that would impose severe punishments on women and girls for violations of the dress code , including up to 10 years in prison and flogging . it must still be approved by the guardian council before it becomes law . the un's fact-finding mission said the "" violent repression of peaceful protests and pervasive institutional discrimination against women and girls "" had led to serious human rights violations that amounted to crimes against humanity .",un rights chief ' horrified ' by mass grave reports at gaza hospitals - bbc news
2024-04-19T00:45:34.000Z,BBC,"us officials have again raised concerns with their israeli counterparts about israel's plans for military operations in the southern gaza city of rafah . the white house said representatives of israel's prime minister had agreed "" to take these concerns into account "" . the us has repeatedly urged israel not to launch a major offensive in rafah to avoid more civilian casualties in gaza . separately , the us vetoed a un resolution to grant full member status to a state of palestine . in another development , us defence secretary lloyd austin spoke to israeli defence minister yoav gallant to "" discuss regional threats and iran's destabilising actions in the middle east "" . they also discussed "" the importance of increasing and sustaining the flow of humanitarian aid to gazan civilians , including via the new route from ashdod port in israel "" . the israeli military says it has struck dozens of targets in gaza , a day after widespread israeli bombing of the central part of the strip as well as gaza city in the north . qatar - which has played a major mediating role in truce talks - said earlier that ceasefire negotiations had stalled . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has consistently vowed to carry out an offensive in rafah - where more than a million palestinians are sheltering - as a next step in military actions against hamas . the us , israel's closest ally , has been pressing israel not to conduct a broad offensive in rafah but to instead take a more targeted approach . the war in gaza erupted when hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern israel on 7 october , killing about 1,200 people , mainly civilians , and taking 253 others back to gaza as hostages . at least 33,970 people have been killed in gaza since then , the majority of them women and children , according to the territory's hamas-run health ministry , during israel's military campaign to destroy hamas and release hostages . a white house readout of thursday's meeting said rafah was the focus of discussions along with iran's unprecedented drone and missile strike on israel last week . "" the two sides agreed on the shared objective to see hamas defeated in rafah . us participants expressed concerns with various courses of action in rafah , "" the statement said . it said they had agreed to have follow-up discussions between experts and would meet again soon . according to us news site axios , us officials have "" flatly denied "" reports that the biden administration gave a "" green light for an operation in rafah "" if israel declined to strike iran in retaliation for last weekend's attack on its territory . israel did not immediately comment on thursday's meeting , which followed similar talks on 1 april . at the time , us officials reportedly told the israelis their planning for rafah was insufficient for evacuating and protecting palestinian civilians sheltering there after being forced to flee their homes . the resolution to grant full un member status to a state of palestine was vetoed by the us at a meeting of the security council . the palestinian authority has had observer status since 2012 but cannot vote in proceedings . twelve members voted in favour of the resolution - including france , japan and south korea - while the us was the lone member voting against , with two abstentions , by the uk and switzerland . it was a unilateral action the us had been keen to avoid if it possibly could , with reports of intense behind-the-scenes lobbying in advance of the vote in the hope of winning over some other security council members to its side . explaining his country's veto , the us deputy ambassador , robert wood , insisted washington continued to strongly support a two-state solution , but that any change in status for a state of palestine at the un should only come as part of a negotiated settlement with israel . the palestinian envoy to the un , riyad mansour , said his people had a "" natural right "" to self-determination .

"" they are only an obstacle to the realization of israel's interests .

2024-04-19T11:59:29.000Z,BBC,"this morning warning sirens sounded across northern israel as they do most days . the army said later that it was a false alarm . but for the people of israel it was a reminder - if one were needed - of just how fast and how easily iran could retaliate if it wanted to . for north of the border in lebanon lie some 150,000 missiles pointed at israel by the iranian-backed militia hezbollah . these are not basic rockets fired out of tubes but advanced , accurate and powerful missiles that could reach targets in israel within minutes . and they could be deployed on iran's instructions at a moment's notice . and yet despite the reported israeli retaliation against iran , the streets of jerusalem were calm , as people went about their business preparing for shabbat . joggers were out in force as usual on the beaches of tel aviv . the authorities said there was no change in advice to the public ; there were no instructions for people to head to shelters . this reflected the fact that israel's air strike on iran appeared initially to be limited in scope and scale . yes , israel had chosen to attack on the birthday of iran's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , who turned 85 today . but if the strike was against military targets that were perhaps associated with iran's attack on israel last weekend - such as an airbase or drone factory or missile storage facility - then that could be seen as the restrained response israel's western allies were looking for . diplomats in europe and the united states feared israel could respond with what is known locally as a "" spectacular "" , a strike perhaps that exceeded the scale of iran's last weekend that involved more than 300 drones and missiles . or perhaps that targeted iran's nuclear facilities . all of which could have triggered a similar iranian retaliation , risking all-out regional war . but instead israel appears to be sending a message to tehran that it can attack deep within iranian territory without restraint . in other words , israel can attack iran's nuclear facilities - not far from the reported location of the strike - but chose not to on this occasion . jonathan conricus , a former idf spokesman , said : "" iran seeks to return to the shadows and is downplaying the israeli strike on the strategic city of isfahan , but i think they've gotten the message : israel can penetrate iranian defences and strike wherever it wants . "" by not publicly acknowledging responsibility for the strike - as is commonplace - israel's war cabinet may hope to make it more difficult for hardline members of the governing coalition to criticise the limited nature of the attack , thus avoiding a political row over passover . but that did not restrain some . israel's far-right national security minister , itamar ben gvir , said a few days ago he wanted israel to "" go berserk "" in response to iran's attack . this morning the minister - upon whose faction the prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , depends - seemed less than impressed . on x , the social media platform formerly known as twitter , he posted one word , best translated as : "" lame . "" israel's opposition leader , yair lapid , hit back hard at this , posting : "" a security cabinet minister has never caused such heavy damage to the country's security , image and international standing . with an unforgivable , one word tweet ben gvir managed to ridicule and embarrass israel all the way from tehran to washington . any other prime minister would have thrown him out of the cabinet this morning . "" there have been reports that some ultra-orthodox religious leaders had been cautioning the war cabinet about striking without us support , potentially giving mr netanyahu cover for a limited attack on iran . but if this strike is self-contained and not the start of a series of attacks , then some israelis will be unsatisfied . after iran's attack last weekend , i spoke to daniel greenzweig , 65 , a businessman working in the hi-tech sector , who told me : "" we need to hit them and we need to hit them hard . they need to realise that that is not the kind of behaviour that can be tolerated . i am not recommending we destroy their nuclear facilities but , if they did , i wouldn't have a problem with it . "" but not all israelis share that view . in fact , people have appeared divided over whether - and how hard - their government should strike back . an opinion poll published earlier this week by the hebrew university of jerusalem suggested 52 % of people believed israel should not respond , with 48 % saying it should . it also found that only 28 % of people supported military action if it led to a larger overall war , with 34 % saying they were opposed , with a sizeable 38 % saying they did not know . so israel awaits a response from iran . many have woken up with real fear about what could happen next . the risk of miscalculation remains . we do not know yet what further strikes on iran - if any - are being considered . i have spoken to international residents in israel who are actively considering evacuating their families . the australian government urged its citizens to leave both israel and the occupied palestinian territories , citing a "" high risk of military reprisals and terrorist attacks "" . the us embassy in jerusalem urged american citizens here to be cautious , warning the security environment could change quickly . the people of israel had been preparing for the start of the passover holiday next week . they will now also be waiting to see if and when and how iran decides to retaliate .",israel-gaza briefings : have iran-israel missile strikes changed the middle east ? - bbc news

"" israel militarily vastly overmatches iran and this is a demonstration of that , "" he said . "" iran would far more like to fight in the shadows using its terror groups and proxies rather than go toe-to-toe with israel conventionally where it knows it would get a real hammering . "" russia - which has increasingly close military cooperation with iran - has communicated to israel that iran "" does not want escalation "" , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said on friday . "" there have been telephone contacts between the leadership of russia and iran , our representatives and the israelis . we made it very clear in these conversations , we told the israelis that iran does not want escalation , "" mr lavrov told russian radio . mr de bretton-gordon said iran had "" slightly restored pride "" after attacking israel last weekend , following the suspected israeli missile strike on its consulate in syria on 1 april , and did not want to escalate further . "" it knows that israel is absolutely determined and seems to have the backing of the us and others . iran can't really rely on much help , perhaps a little bit from russia which is very keen to keep the focus on the middle east and not ukraine , but apart from that it is a little bit isolated , "" he said .

2024-04-20T01:32:04.000Z,BBC,"the latest round in the region's most dangerous rivalry appears to be over , for now . israel still has not officially acknowledged that the attack in iran in the early hours of friday morning was its doing . meanwhile , iran's military and political leaders have downplayed , dismissed and even mocked that anything of consequence happened at all . the accounts over what kind of weaponry was deployed on friday and how much damage was caused are still conflicting and incomplete . american officials speak of a missile strike , but iranian officials say the attacks , in the central province of isfahan and in northwest tabriz , were caused by small exploding drones . "" the downed micro air vehicles caused no damage and no casualties , "" iran's foreign minister hossein amir-abdollahian insisted to the semi-official tasnim news agency . but these simple quadcopters are israel's calling card â_x0080__x0093_ it has deployed them time and again in its years of covert operations inside iran . this time their main target was the storied central province of isfahan , which is celebrated for its stunning islamic heritage . of late , however , the province is more famous for the natanz nuclear facility , the isfahan nuclear technology centre and a major air base , which was used during iran's 14 april attack on israel . it is also an industrial heartland housing factories which produce the drones and ballistic missiles that were fired by the hundreds in israel's direction last sunday . so a limited operation seems to have carried a powerful warning â_x0080__x0093_ that israel has the intelligence and assets to strike at will at iran's beating heart . it is a message so urgent that israel made sure it was sent before , rather than after , the start of the jewish passover , as was widely predicted by israel watchers . us officials have also indicated that israel targeted sites such as iran's air defence radar system , which protects natanz . there is still no confirmed account of its success . so this attack may also be just an opening salvo . but it was , for the moment , an unintended 85th birthday gift to iran's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei . israel's official silence gave iran's ultimate decision-maker vital political space . tehran did not have to invoke its new rule that whenever its arch-enemy strikes , iran will hit back hard , with the risk of sparking a perilous escalatory spiral . iran is also basking in what it sees as its new projection of power . hardline president ebrahim raisi did not even mention these most recent events in his friday speeches . for the islamic republic , it is all about what it dubs operation true promise â_x0080__x0093_ its unprecedented onslaught against israel in the dead of night last sunday . he hailed what he called his country's "" steely will "" . iran has prided itself for years on its "" strategic patience "" , its policy of playing a long game rather than retaliating immediately and directly to any provocations . now , it is invoking "" strategic deterrence "" . this new doctrine was triggered by the 1 april attack on its diplomatic compound in damascus , which destroyed its consular annex and killed seven revolutionary guards , including its most senior commander in the region . iran's supreme leader was under mounting pressure to draw a line as israel ramped up its targets during the last six months of the grievous gaza war . no longer just striking tehran's assets , including arms caches , buildings , bases and supply routes on battle grounds like syria and lebanon , israel was also assassinating top-ranking officials . a decades-long hostility , which had previously played out in shadow wars and covert operations , erupted in open confrontation . whatever the specifics of this latest tit for tat , there is a more fundamental priority for both sides : deterrence â_x0080__x0093_ a more solid certainty that strikes on its own soil will not happen again . if they do , there is a cost to pay , and it will hurt . for the moment there is an audible sigh of relief in the region , and in capitals far and wide . israel's latest move , under anxious urging from its allies to limit its retaliation , will have eased this tension , for now . everyone wants to stop a catastrophic all-out war . but no one will be in any doubt that any lull may not last . the region is still on fire . the gaza war grinds on , causing a staggering number of palestinian casualties . under pressure from its staunchest allies , israel has facilitated the delivery of greater quantities of desperately needed aid , but the blighted territory still teeters on the brink of famine . israeli hostages have still not come home , and ceasefire talks are stalled . israel still warns of battles to come in hamas's last stronghold in rafah â_x0080__x0093_ what aid chiefs and world leaders say would be yet another untold humanitarian disaster . iran's network of proxies across the region , what it calls an "" axis of resistance "" stretching from hezbollah strongholds in lebanon through iran-aligned militias in iraq and syria , to the houthis of yemen , are at the ready , still attacking daily . in the last few weeks , simultaneously everything and nothing has changed in the region's darkest , most dangerous days .",keith siegel and omri miran : video shows us and israeli hostages alive in gaza - bbc news

2024-04-20T10:41:38.000Z,BBC,"a military base in iraq housing a pro-iranian militia has been damaged in an explosion , killing one and wounding eight , security officials there have said . iraq's military reported no drones or fighter jets in the area before or during the blast . but the militia organisation involved , the popular mobilisation forces ( pmf ) , blamed an attack . it comes amid heightened tensions between israel and iran . the pmf is an umbrella organisation that contains several pro-iranian militias that are part of the network of proxies that tehran has been able to use to advance its interests across the middle east for years . those militias have attacked us personnel and interests in iraq on a number of occasions in the past , with the aim of trying to force the remaining us troops to leave the country . the us has regularly struck back at the militias . the pentagon has , however , moved swiftly to deny any involvement in this incident . it comes as the long-running confrontation between israel and iran has recently moved into a new , more perilous phase , amid tensions heightened by the war in gaza . in contrast to the shadow war they have been engaged in for many years , both countries appear to have directly attacked each other's territory . there was a presumed israeli strike carried out near the iranian city of isfahan early on friday morning . the attack was an apparent response to a major drone and missile barrage that tehran launched on israel six days earlier . the iranian action was in retaliation for an earlier strike on senior iranian military commanders in the syrian capital damascus - widely believed to have been carried out by israel . while the conflict still seems contained to some extent for now , the iranian foreign minister has warned that iran will deliver an immediate and "" maximum "" response if israel launches significant attacks on its interests . the explosion at kalso military base , about 50km ( 30 miles ) south of baghdad , happened early on saturday morning , the military said . a member of the pmf was killed in the blast and eight others were wounded . in a statement , the pmf said its chief of staff abdul aziz al-mohammedawi had visited the base to review what investigators had found so far . the iraqi military also said it was investigating the cause of the explosion and fire at the base . "" the air defence command report confirmed , through technical efforts and radar detection , that there was no drone or fighter jets in the air space of babil before and during the explosion , "" a statement read . the us military's central command denied what it said were reports the us had carried out air strikes in iraq in a post on x , formerly known as twitter .",iraq criminalises same-sex relationships in new law - bbc news
2024-04-20T14:27:07.000Z,BBC,"while the media's glare in the middle east this past week was diverted to iran's dramatic missile and drone attack on israel , there has been no let-up in fighting in gaza . dozens of palestinians were killed daily - including many children , according to figures from the hamas-run health ministry . it now says israel has killed more than 34,000 people in gaza since the start of the war . as israel's forces continue with their efforts to destroy hamas , they have conducted small-scale , often deadly operations , from the top to the bottom of the territory over the past week . on tuesday , in the middle of gaza , relatives clutching limp and bloodstained bodies of small boys and girls rushed from al-maghazi refugee camp to al-aqsa martyrs ' hospital in nearby deir al-balah . medics at the hospital said that at least 12 people were killed and some 30 injured by shelling in al-maghazi . "" they were playing in the street . why were they struck ? they weren't in any position close to israeli forces , "" one man told the bbc . another added : "" they were just playing . they were in the market with people coming and going normally . "" israel's military has not commented on what happened there , but this week in gaza the central refugee camps have been its main focus . it said it was "" eliminating terrorists and destroying terrorist infrastructure "" such as attack tunnels and military compounds used by armed hamas fighters in "" precise "" action . after israeli forces were reported to have left another camp , nuseirat , late on wednesday , residents began trickling back to inspect the damage to their homes . "" we have no place to stay , 90 % of the houses are destroyed , "" one father told us despairingly as he picked his way through the new piles of rubble . in the very north of gaza , israel's tanks rolled back into beit hanoun , which troops had left weeks earlier . israel said it was targeting hamas and islamic jihad operatives based at schools where displaced families were living . locals talked of men being stripped and detained . footage has also emerged of israeli strikes in parts of gaza city , in the north , and rafah , on the border with egypt , where hundreds of thousands of palestinians live in tents after fleeing the fighting elsewhere . israeli defence analysts say that the military is carrying out targeted operations against hamas , in line with a switch to lower-intensity fighting that was agreed with the us . earlier this month , israel withdrew most ground forces from gaza , leaving just one brigade to secure a line that splits the enclave into two parts - north and south . while it has since been announced that two reservist brigades are being called up , and some soldiers have been deployed across the border , the prevailing opinion is that a planned ground offensive in rafah is still some way off . "" i don't think anything is imminent , "" says prof chuck freilich , a former israeli deputy national security adviser , now based at the institute for national security studies in tel aviv . "" i don't think there's the force there for conducting a major operation in rafah . "" israel has promised to root out remaining hamas battalions in rafah - the one gazan city where it has not yet launched a ground offensive . it believes that some of the remaining 130-plus hostages snatched from southern israel during the deadly hamas attacks on 7 october , which also killed more than 1,200 people , are held there . but prof freilich says for "" the full-on attack that people were talking about you'd need two things : to move out all the refugees and then to call up some of those reserves "" . "" between those , it's at least a couple of weeks . and now there's the [ week-long jewish ] passover holiday . "" the us and other allies point out that a large-scale invasion could deepen an already dire humanitarian crisis . amid miserable living conditions and the continuous threat to rafah , many gazans stuck there long to return home to the north of the territory . but on monday , israel's military renewed warnings for them not to make the journey , a day after witnesses said its forces had opened fire on crowds heading along a main coastal road . killing five people . the idf did not comment directly on that incident , but an israeli military spokesman said afterwards that palestinians should stay in southern gaza because the north is a "" dangerous combat zone "" . "" we have dreamt of returning home since we left in the early months of the war , "" amr daoudi told us back in rafah . "" but for now we have put it out of our thoughts . "" more than six months of fighting have flattened vast tracts of the north . israel's restrictions on aid have also left some 300,000 who remained there through the war on the brink of famine , according to the united nations . international pressure on israel in the wake of the killing of seven aid workers from us charity world central kitchen on 1 april led to a string of announcements on increasing relief to gaza , notably opening up the ashdod commercial port and a new northern crossing . while aid concerns have been overshadowed , in the past week , by fears of a wider regional war , there have been constant updates on developments - israeli defence officials declaring the arrival of shipments of flour destined for newly reopening bakeries , for example . anecdotal evidence , including social media footage of grilled meat being sold in jabalia camp for the first time in months , has also circulated , suggesting food is becoming more easily available . however , aid agencies say that far more needs to be done to reverse critical shortages . as the un launched a flash appeal to raise $ 2.8bn ( â£2.3bn ) in funding , mainly for gaza , a senior official from its humanitarian office complained of lingering access problems , particularly to reach the north . "" we are dealing with this dance where we do one step forward , two steps backwards ; or two steps forward and one step backward , "" says andrea de domenico , who heads the un humanitarian office for palestinian territories . if israel's response to iran's recent strikes is now over , drawing a line under the latest round of violence between these two old enemies , the media and foreign players are likely to increase their scrutiny of goings-on in gaza once again . already , we got a hint of this when the uk foreign secretary david cameron came to express solidarity with israel and try to reduce tensions after the iranian attacks of 13-14 april . "" the real need is to refocus back on hamas , back on the hostages , back on getting the aid back in , back on getting a pause in the conflict in gaza , "" he said , ahead of meetings with israeli and palestinian leaders . for now , international mediation efforts to secure a new truce have largely stalled . the main obstacle remains that israel will discuss a temporary halt to bring home hostages but will not stop fighting until hamas is eliminated . hamas says it will not release the hostages without a path to end the war . for ordinary gazans struggling just to survive and israelis desperate to bring home loved ones trapped in captivity , the best hope now could come from a new diplomatic thrust . without it there is the threat of a lingering war which carries a huge cost to humanity and constantly risks sparking further destabilising conflict in an already volatile part of the world .",bbc gaza correspondent : my struggle to keep family safe while covering the war - bbc news

2024-04-22T18:18:53.000Z,BBC,"a un report into the palestinian refugee agency unrwa has concluded it must do more to improve its neutrality , staff vetting and transparency . but the independent review also said that israel had failed to back up a claim that many of the agency's staff belonged to terror groups . some of unrwa's staff were accused by israel of involvement in the 7 october attacks and of being hamas members . this led several countries to halt funding to the humanitarian agency . the new report says israel has not yet provided "" supporting evidence "" for its allegations . however it adds that the agency's monitoring processes need to improve , and that neutrality-related issues persist despite the fact that the organisation has a "" robust framework "" . the israeli authorities have rejected the findings , claiming the report ignores the severity of the problem . they say the problem with the agency is not "" that of a few bad apples : it is a rotten and poisonous tree whose roots are hamas "" . israel initially alleged that 12 unrwa staff took part in the hamas attacks on southern israel , which saw 1,200 people killed and about 250 taken hostage . unrwa fired the 10 of those employees who were still alive and a separate investigation by the un's office of internal oversight into those allegations is ongoing . monday's report looks at the other israeli claim that large numbers of unrwa staff are members of terror groups or have family members who are . israel has said more than 2,135 employees of the agency - of a total of 13,000 in gaza - are members of hamas or palestinian islamic jihad , proscribed as terrorist organisations by israel , the uk , us and others . it has also suggested a fifth of unrwa school administrators are hamas members . unrwa insists it carries out detailed reference checks on all staff , and shares staff lists with all host states including israel . this new report says israel is yet to provide supporting evidence for its claims . but it is not a glowing endorsement of the agency . led by former french foreign minister catherine colonna , and supported by three european research institutes , it finds that unrwa could do better upholding the obligatory humanitarian principles of neutrality and impartiality . it points to staff vetting systems that could be improved - but adds that for this to happen , there needs to be better cooperation with and from israeli and palestinian authorities . israel already receives lists of unrwa staff for its own vetting purposes on a regular basis . the report also highlights how challenging - even dangerous - unrwa's working environment is . violence is common , opinions are polarised , and although unrwa's systems are described as more rigorous than many other agencies , the report suggests they are often hampered by low staffing and security concerns . the un chief and head of unrwa have accepted the report's findings in full , and pledged to implement all its recommendations . although several donors including japan , sweden , finland , canada and the eu have resumed funding to unrwa , the us and uk have not . the un will be hoping this report will encourage them to restore their financial support . but some donors may want to wait for the other un investigation that specifically looks at allegations that 12 unrwa staff actually took part in the 7 october attack , before restoring cash to an organisation today's report described , despite its need for improvement , as "" irreplaceable and indispensable to palestinians ' human and economic development "" .",layla moran : mp's family flee gaza months into war
2024-04-22T23:31:51.000Z,BBC,"a few days after hamas attacked israel and war erupted in gaza , umm mohamed in the occupied west bank received a telephone call from her son in an israeli prison . "" pray for me mum , "" abdulrahman mari said . "" things are getting harder here . they might not let me speak to you again "" . it would be the last time she heard his voice . conditions deteriorated for palestinian prisoners in israel after 7 october last year , when hamas mounted its deadly assault on israeli communities near the gaza strip , according to the west bank-based palestinian authority's ( pa ) commission of detainees affairs . thirteen palestinian prisoners have since died in israeli prisons , "" the majority of them as a result of beating or denial of medication "" , the commission's head , qadoura fares , told the bbc . abdulrahman was one of the first to die . a carpenter in the village of qarawat bani hassan , he had been on his way back home from work in ramallah in february last year when he was arrested at a mobile checkpoint . he was taken into administrative detention - under which israel can hold people indefinitely without charge - in megiddo prison . his brother ibrahim said the charges against him were minor , such as taking part in protests and possessing a firearm , but said he was also accused of belonging to hamas although there were no specific charges about any activities within the group . ibrahim is still trying to piece together how exactly his brother died . he has to rely on testimony from abdulrahman's former cellmates , as well as reports from court hearings . one former cellmate , who spoke to the bbc on condition of anonymity , said : "" after 7 october , it was total torture . they beat us for no reason , they searched us for no reason . even if you look at someone the wrong way . "" he described having seen abdulrahman heavily beaten in front of him and others . "" at 9am , they came into our cell , and began to beat us . one of the guards began to insult abdulrahman's parents , which he didn't stand for , and he began to fight back . "" they beat him badly , and took him away to another cell upstairs for a week . during that time you could hear him crying out in pain . "" he said he had only found out about abdulrahman's death after he left prison a week later . the israeli prison service did not directly address the bbc's questions about abdulrahman's death or those of the 12 other named palestinians that the commission of detainees affairs says have died , saying only : "" we are not familiar with the claims described and as far as we know they are not true . "" professor danny rosin , a doctor from the group physicians for human rights , attended the examination of abdulrahman mari's body . his remarks corroborate what abdulrahman's cellmate and brother told the bbc . prof rosin's report mentioned that bruises had been seen over abdulrahman's left chest , and that he had several broken ribs . external bruises were also seen on the back , buttocks , left arm and thigh , as well as the right side of the head and neck with no fractures underneath . it also quoted an additional police report which had mentioned "" forceful restraint "" being used on mr mari six days before his death . professor rosin said in the report that while no specific cause of death had been found , "" one may assume that the violence he suffered manifested by the multiple bruises and multiple severe rib fractures contributed to his death "" . he also added that "" irregular pulse "" or a "" heart attack "" could result from these injuries without leaving any physical evidence . israel currently holds more than 9,300 security prisoners , the vast majority of whom are palestinians according to the israeli rights group hamoked , including more than 3,600 people in administrative detention . these figures do not include detainees from the gaza strip being held in separate facilities by the israeli military . mr qadoura says the change after 7 october "" affected every aspect of the prisoners ' lives "" , alleging that prisoners have been subjected to starvation and thirst and some of those with chronic illnesses were denied their medication . beatings became more regular and more brutal . "" i met a detainee who'd lost 20kg in the last three months , "" he said . "" it's as if the war on gaza was also a war on palestinian prisoners . it was all a form of revenge . "" the bbc has previously heard from palestinian prisoners who described being hit with sticks , having muzzled dogs set on them and having their clothes , food and blankets taken away in the weeks after 7 october . the israeli prison service has denied any mistreatment , saying that "" all prisoners are held in accordance with the law while respecting their basic rights and under the supervision of a professional and skilled prison staff "" . it said prisons had gone into "" emergency mode "" after war broke out and it had been "" decided to reduce the living conditions of the security prisoners "" . examples it gave included removing electrical equipment and cutting electricity to cells and reducing prisoners ' activities in the wings . in the west bank village of beit sira , arafat hamdan's father showed where israeli police officers had kicked the door of his family home and stormed in at 04:00 on 22 october looking for his son . police covered his son's face with a thick black cloth and closed it around his neck with a rope . the mask smelled strongly , he said , and arafat clearly had a hard time breathing with it on . "" i kept trying to comfort him . "" yasser hamdan told the bbc . "" it's ok . they have nothing against you . they have nothing against us . i kept telling him that as they tied him up outside the house . then they took him . "" two days later a phone call came . arafat had been found dead in his cell in ofer prison in the west bank . israeli authorities have not explained how he died . arafat had type 1 diabetes and would suffer from low blood sugar levels from time to time . his father said one of the police officers arresting arafat had told him to bring medicine with him , but it was unclear if he had been able to . the bbc obtained a report by dr daniel solomon , a surgeon who was present at the post mortem of arafat hamdan at the request of physicians for human rights . dr solomon said it had been carried out in israel on 31 october but added that the condition of the body , due to prolonged refrigeration , had made it harder to determine the cause of death . he also noted the absence of any records showing if arafat's diabetes medication had been administered and at what dosing . the report also mentioned the need for other tests beyond the post mortem to determine the cause of death . "" until now we don't know how he died . nothing is clear . "" yasser hamdan said . neither arafat's nor abdulrahman's bodies have yet been returned . their families want to arrange their own post mortems , hold funerals , and say a final goodbye .

"" victims had reportedly been buried deep in the ground and covered with waste , "" ravina shamdasani told reporters in geneva . "" among the deceased were allegedly older people , women and wounded , while others . . . were found with their hands tied and stripped of their clothes . "" mr tã¼rk called for independent , effective and transparent investigations into the deaths , adding : "" given the prevailing climate of impunity , this should include international investigators . "" "" hospitals are entitled to very special protection under international humanitarian law . and the intentional killing of civilians , detainees , and others who are hors de combat [ not participating in hostilities ] is a war crime . "" the us state department also said the reports were "" incredibly troubling "" . on monday , a spokesman for the hamas-run civil defense force told bbc arabic's gaza today programme that it had received reports from local palestinians that the bodies of a "" large number "" of people who had been killed during the war and buried in a makeshift cemetery in the hospital's courtyard were moved to another location during the israeli raid . "" after research and investigation , we learned that the occupation [ israeli ] army had established a mass grave , pulled out the bodies that were in nasser hospital , and buried them in this mass grave , "" mahmoud basal said . gaza today also spoke to a man who said he was searching there for the bodies of two male relatives which he alleged had been taken by israeli troops during israel's recently concluded offensive in khan younis . "" after i had buried them in an apartment , the [ israelis ] came and moved their bodies , "" he said . "" every day we search for their bodies , but we fail to find them . "" hamas has alleged that the bodies include people "" executed in cold blood "" by israeli forces , without providing evidence . the israel defense forces ( idf ) said in a statement on tuesday : "" the claim that the idf buried palestinian bodies is baseless and unfounded . "" "" during the idf's operation in the area of nasser hospital , in accordance to the effort to locate hostages and missing persons , corpses buried by palestinians in the area of nasser hospital were examined . "" the examination was conducted in a careful manner and exclusively in places where intelligence indicated the possible presence of hostages . the examination was carried out respectfully while maintaining the dignity of the deceased . bodies examined , which did not belong to israeli hostages , were returned to their place . "" the idf said that its forces had detained "" about 200 terrorists who were in the hospital "" during the raid , and that they found ammunition as well as unused medicines intended for israeli hostages . it also insisted that the raid was carried out "" in a targeted manner and without harming the hospital , the patients and the medical staff "" . however , three medical staff told the bbc last month that they were humiliated , beaten , doused with cold water , and forced to kneel for hours after being detained during the raid . medics who remained at nasser after the israeli takeover said they were unable to care for patients and that 13 died because of conditions there , including a lack of water , electricity and other supplies . on 1 april , israeli troops withdrew from al-shifa hospital , which is in gaza city , following what the idf said was another "" precise "" operation carried out in response to intelligence that hamas had regrouped there . the idf said at the time that 200 "" terrorists "" were killed in and around the hospital during the two-week raid . more than 500 others were detained , and weapons and intelligence were found "" throughout the hospital "" , it added . after a mission gained access to the facility five days later , the world health organization ( who ) said al-shifa was "" now an empty shell "" , with most of the buildings extensively damaged or destroyed , and the majority of equipment unusable or reduced to ashes . it also said that "" numerous shallow graves "" had been dug just outside the emergency department , and the administrative and surgical buildings , and that "" many dead bodies were partially buried with their limbs visible "" . the idf also said it had avoided harm to patients at al-shifa . but the who cited the acting hospital director as saying patients were held in abysmal conditions during the siege , and that at least 20 patients reportedly died due to a lack of access to care and limited movement authorised for medics . spokeswoman ms shamdasani said reports seen by the un human rights office suggested that a total of 30 bodies were buried in the two graves and that 12 of them had been identified so far . "" there are reports that the hands of some of these bodies were also tied , "" she said , adding that "" many more "" people could have been killed than the 200 reported by the idf . gaza's civil defence spokesman told cnn on 9 april that 381 bodies had been recovered from the vicinity of al-shifa , but that the figure did not include people buried in the hospital's grounds . the un human rights chief also deplored as "" beyond warfare "" a series of israeli strikes on the southern city of rafah in the past few days , which he said had killed mostly women and children . the strikes included one on saturday night , after which a premature baby was delivered from the womb of her pregnant mother , who was killed along with her husband and other daughter . mr tã¼rk also again warned against a full-scale israeli ground assault on rafah , where 1.5 million displaced civilians are sheltering , saying it would lead to further breaches of international humanitarian law and human rights law . in response , the idf said it was "" operating to dismantle hamas military and administrative capabilities "" .

"" nearby , other families walk along the perimeter of the graves . it is a scene depressingly familiar from war zones around the world . the bulldozers clawing at the earth to reach the dead . an arm , stiff , extending from beneath the soil . the gravediggers marking out the individual spaces where exhumed corpses will be buried . and the families of the lost , hoping to find their loved ones among the dead . but the universality of the imagery does not necessarily suggest the same explanation . each mass grave - whether in the balkans , central africa , the middle east , or elsewhere - is the consequence of its own local conditions . in a war that has reportedly claimed the lives of more than 34,000 people in a constricted land space , burying the dead has become a complex and often dangerous task . some cemeteries are full . others are impossible to reach because of fighting . because of these pressures bodies have been buried in the grounds of hospitals where israeli forces said they fought hamas . in some wars that i have reported on it was possible to tell reasonably quickly what had happened to the victims . this is because forensic investigators were on the scene relatively soon afterwards and journalists were able to access the area . in the current conditions in gaza - with israel and egypt refusing to admit international journalists , and fighting creating extremely dangerous conditions for any potential team of forensic investigators - it is an immense challenge to specifically determine how and when each of those being exhumed from the graves at nasser hospital and also at al-shifa hospital , to the north in gaza city , met their deaths . were at least some executed by israeli forces , as hamas and local rescue workers claim ? or are the hundreds of dead in mass graves all the victims of air strikes and fighting in the area inside and around the medical complexes , as well as other victims of disease and malnutrition caused by the war ? did the israelis move bodies from one grave to a new grave ? by shayan sardarizadeh and richard irvine-brown , bbc verify bbc verify has verified videos posted online on 22 , 25 and 28 january , which show palestinians burying bodies at two locations in the courtyard of nasser hospital . the footage was geolocated by using the line of double palm trees and matching visible buildings in the middle-distance . the temporary burials took place as medical staff and displaced civilians reported intense fighting in the area and after the hospital was said to have been surrounded by israeli ground forces . we have no way of confirming precisely how many bodies were buried before the israeli raid began on 15 february . gaza's hamas-run health ministry said on 27 january that the bodies of 150 people had been buried in the hospital's courtyard , but it is nearly impossible to verify that figure . we can confirm that footage published in recent days , following the withdrawal of israeli troops from khan younis , shows the same burial sites . the same line of trees and surrounding buildings can be seen clearly . gaza's civil defence force says more than 330 bodies have been recovered , but there are questions that we cannot answer about when and how those people died . nasser hospital officials might have kept records about the bodies that were buried before the israeli raid , but we do not know that . the israeli military has confirmed that it did exhume and examine bodies in the courtyard to see if any were those of hostages seized by hamas , and that they were subsequently "" returned to their place "" . but sky news has verified video and satellite imagery which shows israeli bulldozers drove over the courtyard during their raid , causing visible damage to the site . the director of the united nations high commissioner for human rights office for the palestinian territories , ajith sunghay , told me there had to be an independent forensic investigation of the graves . on tuesday , another un official said that some bodies had been found with their hands tied . this followed a statement by an official of the palestinian civil defence , a group which carries out rescue and recovery operations , that corpses had been found handcuffed , that others had been seen shot in the head , and some wearing detainee uniforms . reem zeidan spent two weeks searching for the body of her son nabil , which was found on wednesday afternoon . reem said she saw bodies that had signs of torture , with their hands cuffed .

2024-04-27T04:34:54.000Z,BBC,"nancy pelosi , the former speaker of the us house of representatives , has urged protesters on college campuses to protest against hamas ' behaviour as well as israel's conduct of the gaza war . hundreds of people have been arrested on dozens of campuses across the us , where protests and encampments have sprung up in support of palestinians in gaza . ms pelosi , who is a close ally of us president joe biden , told the bbc there was "" complete justification "" for speaking out about the growing humanitarian crisis there and the impact on civilians of israel's bombardment was almost "" unforgiveable "" . she has also criticised the actions of the israeli government while arguing it has a right to self-defence , and is no fan of the prime minister , benjamin netanyahu . however , she said she wanted the demonstrators to reflect on their tactics and also condemn hamas's actions on 7 october . "" we would like to see some of that enthusiasm recognise hamas as a terrorist organisation that did a barbaric thing in israel , "" she said . ms pelosi had her speech at the oxford union in the uk interrupted by protesters on thursday night . demonstrators also dumped manure outside her own home in california . "" i've said to those [ protesters ] . . . do you care about what hamas has done , do you care about what happened in israel , would you not , if that happened here would we not have a response ? "" the war in gaza began when hamas-led gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on southern israel on 7 october , killing about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 253 others back to gaza as hostages . since then , at least 34,356 people - most of them children and women - have been killed in gaza , the territory's hamas-run health ministry says . the un has warned of an impending humanitarian catastrophe and israel has faced accusations of limiting the amount of aid reaching civilians by land . activists in the us have been calling for universities to "" divest from genocide "" and to stop investing large school endowments in companies involved in weapons manufacturing and other industries supporting israel's war in gaza . israel is currently facing a case brought by south africa at the international court of justice alleging that it is committing genocide against the palestinians , an accusation israel has rejected as "" baseless "" . she said such protests on college campuses were a "" way of life "" in the us and that there was "" complete justification "" for objecting to what has been happening . "" what's happening in gaza challenges the consciousness of the world , "" she said . some of the protesters on us campuses have been accused of antisemitism . a number of jewish students have said they have felt unsafe at columbia and at other universities , although other jewish students have joined the demonstrations . ms pelosi said protesters needed to think about their tactics , asking : "" what is their message , what is their purpose ? "" she rejected the suggestion from the current leader of the house of representatives , mike johnson , that the national guard should be sent in to deal with the protests . universities have brought in police to force students to leave but some are negotiating with the demonstrators and say these talks are showing progress . the full interview with nancy pelosi will be broadcast on the sunday with laura kuenssberg show , at 09:00 bst on bbc one .",iranians on edge as leaders say ' tel aviv is our battleground '
2024-04-27T06:00:14.000Z,BBC,"british troops could be deployed on the ground in gaza to help deliver aid via a new sea route , the bbc has learned . the us has said no american forces would go ashore and an unnamed "" third party "" would drive trucks along a floating causeway onto the beach . the uk is understood to be considering tasking british troops with this when the aid corridor opens next month . whitehall sources said no decision had been made and the issue had not yet crossed the prime minister's desk . the ministry of defence ( mod ) and israeli army declined to comment . britain has been closely involved in planning the sea-borne aid operation and defence secretary grant shapps said the uk continued to take "" a leading role in the delivery of support in coordination with the us and other international allies "" . the possible role for british forces - known as "" wet boots "" by military planners - would see them drive trucks off landing craft onto the temporary causeway and deliver aid to a secure distribution area ashore . although a huge effort would be made to protect allied forces both off and onshore , british troops would potentially face a higher risk of attack from hamas and other armed groups . on wednesday , a united nations team had to take cover when mortars landed near the planned distribution zone . us defence officials confirmed an american army ship had begun work in the eastern mediterranean to build a large floating pier . aid would be delivered there from cyprus on large ships before being transferred into trucks and smaller landing craft . they said the floating causeway would be "" several hundred metres long "" and anchored firmly into the sand . they said they hoped the new maritime corridor - which they call the joint logistics over-the-shore ( jlots ) operation - would ultimately deliver up to 150 trucks per day . the aim is to add to - but not replace - aid deliveries by land that are still insufficient to meet the need . on average about 220 aid trucks per day are currently getting into gaza by road . the israel defense forces ( idf ) has said it will provide "" security and logistics support for the jlots initiative … to enhance the entry of humanitarian aid to the gaza strip "" . israel's military will be responsible for anchoring the floating causeway to the beach and has been practising how to do this with american forces further north on the israeli coast . in a briefing with journalists , a senior us military official said because there would be no american boots on the ground , hundreds of us soldiers and sailors would live and sleep at sea on a uk naval vessel , rfa cardigan bay . he also made clear us forces would not take the aid ashore and instead that role would be carried out by a "" significant partner "" . he confirmed this would be another nation , not a private military company . "" we have a third party who will be driving the trucks down the pier , "" the us military official said . "" just a point of emphasis , there will be no us military boots on the ground . so , a third party is driving those trucks . "" despite questioning from journalists , he refused to name the third party . one uk source said nothing had been decided but there was a debate going on about "" do we put wet boots on the beach , do we drive trucks onto the pier ? "" . the mod declined to comment about the suggestion uk forces might drive trucks ashore , but mr shapps said the crew of rfa cardigan bay were central to the uk's contribution , adding : "" it is critical we establish more routes for vital humanitarian aid to reach the people of gaza . "" he said specialist british military planning teams had been embedded within the us operational hq in tampa , florida - as well as in cyprus - for several weeks to help develop the safest and most effective maritime route . the uk hydrographic office has also shared analysis of the gazan shore with us planners to develop the pier . more than six months into israel's military operations in the gaza strip , over half of its population of 2.2 million is crammed into the southern city of rafah . the un has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe and israel has faced international criticism for limiting the amount of aid reaching civilians by land . ziad issa , the head of humanitarian policy at actionaid , told bbc radio 4's today programme : "" any way to deliver aid to gaza is welcome and will help a bit , but the problem with this way of delivering aid is it's going to take time and there are lots of logistical uncertainties about it .

"" the mom just told me with just a blank numb stare on her face that he had just died five minutes prior . the staff had been trying to cover up his body with blankets but she just refused to let them . she wanted to spend more time with him . she was grieving , she was sobbing , and stayed that way for about a good 20 minutes , she just didn't want to leave his side . "" then there was the man in his 50s , forgotten in a room , having had both legs amputated . "" he had lost his kids , his grandkids , his home , "" sam recalls , "" and he's alone in the corner of this dark hospital , maggots going out of his wounds and he was screaming : ' the worms are eating me alive please help me . ' that was just one just one out ofâ_x0080_ ¦ i don't know , i just i stopped counting . but those are the people i still think of because they're still there . "" sam is a sensitive , thoughtful man in his 40s , the son of two doctors , who was born and raised in chicago and who works as a surgeon at northwestern hospital in the city . while in gaza he kept video diaries and filmed his experiences . for two weeks in march and april - on behalf of the ngo palestinian american bridge - he worked in gaza hospitals that were desperately short of everything except badly-wounded patients . on the day he entered gaza this time around he was immediately confronted with the hunger crisis . "" we were just swarmed by people banging on the cars , some people trying to jump on the cars . the driversâ_x0080_ ¦ they just got it . they don't stop because if they stopped then people jump on the cars . they're not trying to harm us . they're just begging for food . they're starving . "" sam recounts his experiences calmly , as you might expect of a man trained to put patients at ease . every day there was the relentless pressure of carrying out triage , deciding who could be saved , who was beyond hope . patients lying on hospital floors surrounded by blood and discarded bandages , the air filled with the cries of pain and of grieving relatives . there is no erasing such horrors . even if you are a highly trained doctor with past experience of war zones like ukraine , syria and iraq . "" i still think of all the patients i took care of , "" he says , "" all the doctors that are still there . there's a little bit of guilt and shame at leaving because there's so much that needs to be done . the needs are overwhelming . and you walk away from people that are still there and still suffering . "" the last trip - his third into gaza since the war began - saw him join the first team of international medics to be embedded in a hospital in northern gaza where malnutrition is at its most acute . the mission was organised by the world health organisation ( who ) which has warned of looming famine . some 30 % of children below the age of two are reported to be acutely malnourished , and 70 % of the population in northern gaza is facing what the un calls "" catastrophic hunger . "" last month the un human rights chief , volker turk , accused israel of a potential war crime because of the food crisis in gaza . "" the extent of israel's continued restrictions on entry of aid into gaza , together with the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities , may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war , "" he said . israel denies this and has blamed the un and aid agencies for any slow or inadequate delivery of aid . the israeli government said un calculations on hunger were based on "" multiple factual and methodological flaws , some of them serious . "" the government has said that it had tracked media reports that food markets in gaza , including the north , had plentiful supplies . "" we outright reject any allegations according to which israel is purposefully starving the civilian population in gaza , "" said a statement from cogat - coordinator of government activities in the territories . sam attar remembers the 32-year-old woman admitted suffering from severe malnutrition , with her son , and her mother and father in the room with her . she underwent cpr - attempts to resuscitate the heart - but could not be saved . "" i had to call it , "" sam says . the young mother lay on a bench , her left arm dangling towards the floor , eyes gazing upward in the moment of death . across the room a nurse comforted her crying mother . there was the little girl , jenna ayyad , aged seven , "" just skeleton and bone "" whose mother hoped to get to the south where better medical facilities were available . jenna was traumatised by the war and looked to be extremely malnourished . she suffers from cystic fibrosis , which makes digestion more difficult . her condition has been exacerbated by the conditions of the war and she is also suffering from trauma . in footage taken by a bbc cameraman jenna seems lost and now only speaks to her mother . "" what can i do ? she can't be treated , "" said nisma ayyad . "" her mental state is very difficult . she doesn't talk at all whenever anyone talks to her . her situation is bad , and as a mom , i can't do anything . "" dr attar said that as his team packed up to return to southern gaza , jenna's mother approached him . "" jenna's mom came to me and was saying , ' i thought we were coming with youâ_x0080_ ¦ what's happening ? why are you going and we're staying ? "" sam had to explain that the convoy south was only approved for the delivery of fuel and food and not for carrying patients . but before leaving sam and his colleagues filled in the necessary papers to have jenna transferred . it would take days but they would make sure the paperwork reached the right offices . when sam went to speak with jenna's mother , other mums noticed . "" the problem is it's open , shared rooms , [ with ] maybe 10 patients in one room . so when all the other moms saw me talking to her , they all swarmed me . "" jenna was transferred and is now being treated at the international medical corps hospital near rafah . according to un estimates last month the majority of those killed in the war have been women and children : 13,000 children , 9,000 women . the war is now in its seventh month . negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of hostages are stalled . every day and night the wounded and the malnourished arrive at the few functioning hospitals that are left . the who says that only 10 of gaza's 36 hospitals are still functioning . traveling in gaza can be very dangerous for aid workers . witness the deaths of seven aid workers , including three britons , when the israeli military attacked their convoy with missile strikes on 1 april . sam describes queuing for hours at israeli checkpoints . "" we often wait one to four hours depending on how long it takes for the israelis to approve the passage because they are conducting military operations .

2024-04-28T15:04:11.000Z,BBC,"sam attar reckons he left part of his soul in gaza . it was the part of him that saw suffering and could not turn away . the part which now cannot forget . you can be on the shores of lake michigan on an overcast spring day , the wind whipping up waves on the green water . and at the very same time you can be back there , in the heat and the dying . it's been three weeks since he came home to chicago but it might as well have been yesterday . the faces of that other world are with him : jenna , the traumatised little girl wasting away , spectral pale on a hospital bed , while her mother shows sam a phone video of the child's last birthday . happy days before the disaster . warning : this article contains details and images some readers may find disturbing . another mother whose 10-year-old son had just died . "" the mom just told me with just a blank numb stare on her face that he had just died five minutes prior . the staff had been trying to cover up his body with blankets but she just refused to let them . she wanted to spend more time with him . she was grieving , she was sobbing , and stayed that way for about a good 20 minutes , she just didn't want to leave his side . "" then there was the man in his 50s , forgotten in a room , having had both legs amputated . "" he had lost his kids , his grandkids , his home , "" sam recalls , "" and he's alone in the corner of this dark hospital , maggots going out of his wounds and he was screaming : ' the worms are eating me alive please help me . ' that was just one just one out of … i don't know , i just i stopped counting . but those are the people i still think of because they're still there . "" sam is a sensitive , thoughtful man in his 40s , the son of two doctors , who was born and raised in chicago and who works as a surgeon at northwestern hospital in the city . while in gaza he kept video diaries and filmed his experiences . for two weeks in march and april - on behalf of the ngo palestinian american bridge - he worked in gaza hospitals that were desperately short of everything except badly-wounded patients . on the day he entered gaza this time around he was immediately confronted with the hunger crisis . "" we were just swarmed by people banging on the cars , some people trying to jump on the cars . the drivers … they just got it . they don't stop because if they stopped then people jump on the cars . they're not trying to harm us . they're just begging for food . they're starving . "" sam recounts his experiences calmly , as you might expect of a man trained to put patients at ease . every day there was the relentless pressure of carrying out triage , deciding who could be saved , who was beyond hope . patients lying on hospital floors surrounded by blood and discarded bandages , the air filled with the cries of pain and of grieving relatives . there is no erasing such horrors . even if you are a highly trained doctor with past experience of war zones like ukraine , syria and iraq . "" i still think of all the patients i took care of , "" he says , "" all the doctors that are still there . there's a little bit of guilt and shame at leaving because there's so much that needs to be done . the needs are overwhelming . and you walk away from people that are still there and still suffering . "" the last trip - his third into gaza since the war began - saw him join the first team of international medics to be embedded in a hospital in northern gaza where malnutrition is at its most acute . the mission was organised by the world health organisation ( who ) which has warned of looming famine . some 30 % of children below the age of two are reported to be acutely malnourished , and 70 % of the population in northern gaza is facing what the un calls "" catastrophic hunger . "" last month the un human rights chief , volker turk , accused israel of a potential war crime because of the food crisis in gaza . "" the extent of israel's continued restrictions on entry of aid into gaza , together with the manner in which it continues to conduct hostilities , may amount to the use of starvation as a method of war , "" he said . israel denies this and has blamed the un and aid agencies for any slow or inadequate delivery of aid . the israeli government said un calculations on hunger were based on "" multiple factual and methodological flaws , some of them serious . "" the government has said that it had tracked media reports that food markets in gaza , including the north , had plentiful supplies . "" we outright reject any allegations according to which israel is purposefully starving the civilian population in gaza , "" said a statement from cogat - coordinator of government activities in the territories . sam attar remembers the 32-year-old woman admitted suffering from severe malnutrition , with her son , and her mother and father in the room with her . she underwent cpr - attempts to resuscitate the heart - but could not be saved . "" i had to call it , "" sam says . the young mother lay on a bench , her left arm dangling towards the floor , eyes gazing upward in the moment of death . across the room a nurse comforted her crying mother . there was the little girl , jenna ayyad , aged seven , "" just skeleton and bone "" whose mother hoped to get to the south where better medical facilities were available . jenna was traumatised by the war and looked to be extremely malnourished . she suffers from cystic fibrosis , which makes digestion more difficult . her condition has been exacerbated by the conditions of the war and she is also suffering from trauma . in footage taken by a bbc cameraman jenna seems lost and now only speaks to her mother . "" what can i do ? she can't be treated , "" said nisma ayyad . "" her mental state is very difficult . she doesn't talk at all whenever anyone talks to her . her situation is bad , and as a mom , i can't do anything . "" dr attar said that as his team packed up to return to southern gaza , jenna's mother approached him . "" jenna's mom came to me and was saying , ' i thought we were coming with you … what's happening ? why are you going and we're staying ? "" sam had to explain that the convoy south was only approved for the delivery of fuel and food and not for carrying patients . but before leaving sam and his colleagues filled in the necessary papers to have jenna transferred . it would take days but they would make sure the paperwork reached the right offices . when sam went to speak with jenna's mother , other mums noticed . "" the problem is it's open , shared rooms , [ with ] maybe 10 patients in one room . so when all the other moms saw me talking to her , they all swarmed me . "" jenna was transferred and is now being treated at the international medical corps hospital near rafah . according to un estimates last month the majority of those killed in the war have been women and children : 13,000 children , 9,000 women . the war is now in its seventh month . negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of hostages are stalled . every day and night the wounded and the malnourished arrive at the few functioning hospitals that are left . the who says that only 10 of gaza's 36 hospitals are still functioning . traveling in gaza can be very dangerous for aid workers . witness the deaths of seven aid workers , including three britons , when the israeli military attacked their convoy with missile strikes on 1 april . sam describes queuing for hours at israeli checkpoints . "" we often wait one to four hours depending on how long it takes for the israelis to approve the passage because they are conducting military operations . "" the us doctor wants to see a concerted push to get more aid into the north .

about seven of us - lived on one meal a day . even when there was food , sometimes we did not eat it because there was hardly anywhere to go to the toilet . during this time my friend , al jazeera bureau chief wael al-dahdouh , suffered a terrible loss . the house his family had been staying in was hit in an israeli air strike . his wife , teenage son , seven-year-old daughter and one-year-old grandson were killed . the israeli military says it takes "" feasible precautions "" to reduce civilian casualties , and in this case had "" targeted hamas terrorist infrastructure in the area "" . reporting gaza : my war in gaza , palestinian journalists document the war as they live it on a daily basis . in this bbc world service film , we hear the story of bbc arabic's reporter in gaza , adnan el-bursh who found himself reporting the news , as he was living through it . watch now on bbc iplayer ( uk only ) or on the bbc world service youtube channel ( outside uk ) i watched the footage of my friend , who i have known for 20 years , embracing his children's shroud-wrapped bodies in central gaza . i wished i was there with him . the news came amid a string of reports about the deaths of other friends , relatives and neighbours . my heart ached . i have now lost about 200 people in the war . that day i wept live on air , as i was reporting . in the night , i woke up with tears covering my cheeks . wael's image never left my mind . i have covered conflicts in gaza for 15 years , but this war stands apart , from the unprecedented attack that triggered it , to the scale of the losses . at 06:15 on 7 october i was woken by loud explosions and my children screaming . i went up to the rooftop and saw rockets being launched towards israel from gaza . when we realised hamas had breached the fence into israel -

leaving our homes and the bbc office in gaza city behind - was a pivotal moment in my life . with more than 10 people crammed into one car , my family and i crawled our way south , along a single road , with tens of thousands of other people , on foot and in vehicles , all loaded with belongings . the journey was punctuated by air strikes on nearby areas on both sides of the road . confusion , grief and uncertainty marked the faces of my family and the crowds . the children kept asking me : "" where are we going ? will we be back tomorrow ?

"" i really wish i had taken our photo album , full of pictures of me as a young child , my parents , and my wife and i when we got engaged . my dad was an arabic teacher and i also wish i had taken some of his books that i kept after he died . later , i learned from a neighbour that my house had been completely destroyed , and my farm burned . after that terrifying and surreal journey south , and our night outside the red crescent headquarters , i continued working from khan younis for several weeks . my family were still in nuseirat and being separated from them took a toll emotionally . then , in early december , israel began telling gazans to leave parts of khan younis and move to other areas , including rafah , further south . the israeli military also closed the main road leading north , which connected me and my family . i did not know how i would get to them or where we should go if i did . rafah was already overcrowded with hundreds of thousands of people , and there was barely anywhere to stay . for days , i grappled with swirling emotions . news circulated about israeli forces advancing towards the main roads , apparently aiming to divide the south from the central and northern regions . i was terrified that i - or my family - would be killed and we would never see each other again . for the first time i felt like i had lost it . i did not even know what day it was . i considered stopping work and returning to my family . if we died , we would die together . in the end , on 11 december , i drove with a colleague along a back road to nuseirat . when i arrived , my youngest children rushed up to hug me , with razan reaching round my neck and holding on tight . we managed to move the family to rafah . the bbc team had also relocated there , continuing to report . there were some awful moments . in late december , i reported as the israel defense forces ( idf ) handed about 80 bodies to the authorities in gaza . the idf said it had taken them from gaza to israel so they could be checked to see if there were any hostages among them . a large lorry drove into the cemetery in the rafah area . the stench was overwhelming when the container was opened . men in aprons and masks placed the remains , wrapped in blue plastic , in a mass grave dug by an excavator in the sandy ground . i had never seen a scene like that before . it is hard to describe how horrible it was . then , in january , i was reporting from a hospital in rafah when several bodies were brought in , including another of wael al-dahdouh's sons , hamza , his eldest , who was also a journalist working for al jazeera . who would tell wael ? it just seemed impossible , after the tragedies he had already faced . i could not even listen as one of my colleagues called someone close to wael to pass on the news . hamza and his colleague , freelance videographer mustafa thuraya , were killed in an israeli air strike on their car , after they had reported on the aftermath of another strike in the area . the israeli military alleges they were "" members of gaza-based terrorist organisations "" . the families and al jazeera reject the claims as false . the idf says the two were operating drones "" posing an imminent threat to idf troops "" , but a washington post investigation "" found no indications that either man was operating as anything other than a journalist that day "" . more than 100 journalists have been killed in gaza since 7 october , according to reporters without borders - the vast majority are known to be palestinian . the idf says it "" has never , and will never , deliberately target journalists "" . it says it "" takes all operationally feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians including journalists "" , but "" remaining in an active combat zone has inherent risks "" . eventually , the news came that the bbc team's families had permission to leave gaza . four weeks later , we too finally left through the rafah crossing , facilitated by the egyptian authorities . i am writing this in qatar . but i know that in jabalia , they have been pulling up grass and grinding animal feed to eat , while i'm here having meals in a clean hotel . i find it hard to eat - it's like eating poison . the future is a blur . gaza is my life . i want to return one day , but for now , that seems impossible .",iran warns israel against ' reckless ' retaliation

"" demonstrations have rocked campuses across the us in recent weeks , sparked by new york police clearing an earlier encampment at columbia . hundreds of people have been arrested across the country - among them dozens of protesters at the university of texas at austin on monday . officials there said protesters had ignored directions to take down their tents and that "" baseball-size rocks "" had been found in the encampment . the un human rights chief volker turk has voiced his concern that some law enforcement actions witnessed on american campuses have been "" disproportionate in their impacts "" . "" freedom of expression and the right to peaceful assembly are fundamental to society , "" he added in a statement . at virginia commonwealth university ( vcu ) in richmond , students said police used tear gas and pepper spray against their gathering on monday . the university said the group had been "" repeatedly "" asked to leave , and echoed other institutions by saying many of those involved in the demonstration were not students . elsewhere , there has been a rare agreement reached in evanston , illinois , between northwestern university and protesters who have camped out for days in solidarity with the palestinians . under the deal , the university said it would permit "" peaceful demonstrations "" , provided the encampment was limited to a single tent . activists across the us are demanding that their universities , many with massive endowments , financially divest from israel . divestment means to sell or otherwise drop financial ties . pressure has been building on the leadership of columbia - an elite ivy league university in upper manhattan - to act , or step aside . posting on x before the occupation of hamilton hall , us house speaker mike johnson labelled the scenes at columbia an "" utter disgrace "" and called on the university's president to step down . columbia's campus has become the focal point of the country's debate over the war in gaza and us support for israel , as well as fears that antisemitism is putting jewish students in danger . earlier on monday , a group of house democrats urged its board of trustees to resign if it could not "" act decisively , disband the encampment , and ensure the safety and security of all of its students "" . annual tuition and fees for columbia add up to around $ 90,000 ( £ 72,000 ) for undergraduates , making it one of the most expensive universities in the us . more than 100 people were arrested when police raided the earlier encampment on 18 april . but activists redoubled their efforts , regrouping in another encampment and prompting university leadership to move to hybrid learning . a statement on monday from columbia's president , dr minouche shafik , reiterated that the university "" will not divest from israel "" , and that talks between academic leaders and student organisers had failed to result in an agreement . several hours after the deadline passed for students to take down their camp - and before the break-in at hamilton hall was reported - another official said the university had started to suspend students . this makes them ineligible to graduate . officials say they want to avoid any disruption to graduation ceremonies on 15 may . another of the protesters ' demands is amnesty for activists who face disciplinary action from the university . for now , the cluster of tents remains in place . mahmoud khalil , one of the students who has been negotiating with columbia officials , told the bbc that protesters believed it was "" highly probable "" that police would again be called in again .

"" the accused [ nika ] was constantly swearing and chanting , "" he told investigators for the report . "" at that time , there were 14 other female detainees at the station and my perception was that she could agitate the others . "" i was worried she would cause a riot "" . morteza jalil once again contacted his irgc hq for advice , says the report , and was told to head to tehran's notorious evin prison . en route , he said he began to hear crashing noises behind him coming from the pitch-dark rear compartment of the van . we know what he was hearing , from the testimony outlined in the document from the men guarding nika in the back . one of them , behrooz sadeghy , said as soon as she had been put back into the van after being rejected by the detention centre , nika had started to swear and shout . "" arash kalhor gagged her mouth with his socks but she started struggling . then sadegh [ monjazy ] laid her on the chest freezer and sat on her . the situation calmed , "" he told investigators . "" i don't know what happened , but after a few minutes she started swearing . i couldn't see anything , i could only hear fighting and bashing . "" but arash kalhor gave further chilling details . he says he briefly turned on his phone torch and saw sadegh monjazy "" [ has ] put his hand inside her trousers "" . arash kalhor said after that they lost control . "" he doesn't knowâ_x0080_ ¦ who [ was doing it ] , but he could hearâ_x0080_ ¦ the baton hitting the accused [ nika ] . . . ' i started to kick and punch but really didn't know if i was hitting our guys or the accused . ' "" but sadegh monjazy contradicted arash kalhor's statement , which he said was motivated by professional jealousy . he denied putting his hand in her trousers - but said he could not deny that he became "" aroused "" while sitting on her and touched nika's buttocks . he said this provoked nika - despite the fact her hands were tied behind her back - to scratch him and jolt so that he fell over . "" she kicked at my face , so i had to defend myself . "" from the van's cabin , morteza jalil ordered the driver to pull over . he opened the rear door to discover nika's lifeless body . he said he cleaned the blood from her face and head - "" which were not in a good condition "" . this echoes the state in which nika's mother says she eventually found her daughter in the mortuary , and nika's death certificate - obtained by bbc persian in october 2022 - which states she was killed by "" multiple injuries caused by blows with a hard object "" . team leader morteza jalil admitted he didn't try to find out what had happened . "" i was only thinking about how to transfer her and didn't ask any questions of anyone . i only asked : ' is she breathing ? ' i think it was behrooz sadeghy who answered , ' no , she is dead ' . "" with a killing on his hands , jalil called the irgc's hq for a third time . nika's last breath bbc eye investigates a shocking report , written by the islamic revolutionary guards corps ( irgc ) , showing how nika shakarami was hunted down , sexually assaulted and bludgeoned to death . watch now on bbc iplayer ( uk only ) or on the bbc world service youtube channel ( outside uk ) on this occasion , he spoke to a more senior officer , codenamed "" naeem 16 "" . "" we already had deaths in our stations , and i didn't want the number to rise to 20 , "" naeem 16 told the investigation . "" bringing her to the base wouldn't have solved any problems .

2024-04-29T23:00:38.000Z,BBC,"an iranian teenager was sexually assaulted and killed by three men working for iran's security forces , a leaked document understood to have been written by those forces says . it has let us map what happened to 16-year-old nika shakarami who vanished from an anti-regime protest in 2022 . her body was found nine days later . the government claimed she killed herself . we put the report's allegations to iran's government and its revolutionary guards . they did not respond . marked "" highly confidential "" , the report summarises a hearing on nika's case held by the islamic revolutionary guard corps ( irgc ) - the security force that defends the country's islamic establishment . it includes what it says are the names of her killers and the senior commanders who tried to hide the truth . it contains disturbing details of events in the back of an undercover van in which security forces were restraining nika . these include : there are numerous fake iranian official documents in circulation , so the bbc spent months checking every detail with multiple sources . our extensive investigations indicate the papers we obtained do chronicle the teenager's last movements . nika shakarami's disappearance and death were widely reported , and her picture has become synonymous with the fight by women in iran for greater freedoms . as street protests spread across iran in the autumn of 2022 , her name was shouted by crowds furious at the country's strict rules on the compulsory veil [ hijab ] . the woman , life , freedom movement had been sparked just days earlier by the death of a 22-year-old woman , mahsa amini . she died from injuries sustained in police custody according to a un fact-finding mission after being accused of not wearing her hijab properly . in nika's case , her family found her body in a mortuary more than a week after she disappeared from a protest . but iran's authorities denied nika's death was connected to the demonstration and , after conducting their own investigation , said that she had died by suicide . just before she vanished , nika was filmed on the evening of 20 september near laleh park in central tehran , standing on a dumpster setting fire to hijabs . others around her chanted "" death to the dictator "" - referring to iran's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei . what she could not have known at the time is that she was being watched , as the classified report makes clear . addressed to the irgc's commander-in-chief , it says it is based on extensive talks with its teams that policed that protest . monitoring the demonstration were several undercover security units , the document's account begins . it says one of these - team 12 - suspected the teenager "" of leadership , due to her unconventional behaviour and repeated calls with her mobile phone "" . the team sent one of its operatives into the crowd , posing as a protester , to confirm nika was indeed one of the demonstration's leaders . then , according to the report , he called in his team to arrest her . but she fled . her aunt had previously told bbc persian that nika rang a friend that night to say she was being chased by security forces . almost an hour passed before she was spotted again , says the report , when she was detained and put in the team's vehicle - an unmarked freezer van . nika was in the rear compartment with three team 12 members - arash kalhor , sadegh monjazy , and behrooz sadeghy . their team leader morteza jalil was up front with the driver . the group then attempted to find somewhere to take her , the report says . they tried a temporary police camp nearby but were turned away because it was overcrowded . so they continued to a detention centre , a 35-minute drive away , whose commander initially agreed to admit nika . but then he changed his mind . "" the accused [ nika ] was constantly swearing and chanting , "" he told investigators for the report . "" at that time , there were 14 other female detainees at the station and my perception was that she could agitate the others . "" i was worried she would cause a riot "" . morteza jalil once again contacted his irgc hq for advice , says the report , and was told to head to tehran's notorious evin prison . en route , he said he began to hear crashing noises behind him coming from the pitch-dark rear compartment of the van . we know what he was hearing , from the testimony outlined in the document from the men guarding nika in the back . one of them , behrooz sadeghy , said as soon as she had been put back into the van after being rejected by the detention centre , nika had started to swear and shout . "" arash kalhor gagged her mouth with his socks but she started struggling . then sadegh [ monjazy ] laid her on the chest freezer and sat on her . the situation calmed , "" he told investigators . "" i don't know what happened , but after a few minutes she started swearing . i couldn't see anything , i could only hear fighting and bashing . "" but arash kalhor gave further chilling details . he says he briefly turned on his phone torch and saw sadegh monjazy "" [ has ] put his hand inside her trousers "" . arash kalhor said after that they lost control . "" he doesn't knowâ_x0080_ ¦ who [ was doing it ] , but he could hearâ_x0080_ ¦ the baton hitting the accused [ nika ] . . . ' i started to kick and punch but really didn't know if i was hitting our guys or the accused . ' "" but sadegh monjazy contradicted arash kalhor's statement , which he said was motivated by professional jealousy . he denied putting his hand in her trousers - but said he could not deny that he became "" aroused "" while sitting on her and touched nika's buttocks . he said this provoked nika - despite the fact her hands were tied behind her back - to scratch him and jolt so that he fell over . "" she kicked at my face , so i had to defend myself . "" from the van's cabin , morteza jalil ordered the driver to pull over . he opened the rear door to discover nika's lifeless body . he said he cleaned the blood from her face and head - "" which were not in a good condition "" . this echoes the state in which nika's mother says she eventually found her daughter in the mortuary , and nika's death certificate - obtained by bbc persian in october 2022 - which states she was killed by "" multiple injuries caused by blows with a hard object "" . team leader morteza jalil admitted he didn't try to find out what had happened . "" i was only thinking about how to transfer her and didn't ask any questions of anyone . i only asked : ' is she breathing ? ' i think it was behrooz sadeghy who answered , ' no , she is dead ' . "" with a killing on his hands , jalil called the irgc's hq for a third time . nika's last breath bbc eye investigates a shocking report , written by the islamic revolutionary guards corps ( irgc ) , showing how nika shakarami was hunted down , sexually assaulted and bludgeoned to death . watch now on bbc iplayer ( uk only ) or on the bbc world service youtube channel ( outside uk ) on this occasion , he spoke to a more senior officer , codenamed "" naeem 16 "" . "" we already had deaths in our stations , and i didn't want the number to rise to 20 , "" naeem 16 told the investigation . "" bringing her to the base wouldn't have solved any problems .

"" four of these units have effectively remediated these violations , which is what we expect partners to do , "" he said . "" for a remaining unit , we continue to be in consultations and engagements with the government of israel ; they have submitted additional information as it pertains to that unit , "" he added . the department denies claims it backed down under political pressure by continuing military assistance to the unit despite being unable to say whether or not there had been any accountability in the case . "" we are engaging with them in a process , and we will make an ultimate decision when it comes to that unit when that process is complete , "" said mr patel . all the incidents are believed to have taken place in the occupied west bank and jerusalem in recent years . under america's "" leahy law "" , sponsored in 1997 by then-senator patrick leahy , a finding that a foreign military unit committed gross violations of human rights means it can be cut from receiving us military assistance . the us government says it considers torture , extrajudicial killing , enforced disappearance and rape as such types of violations when implementing the leahy law . even when there is such a finding , there is an exception to cutting military assistance if the state department is satisfied the cases have been dealt with and justice pursued by the government involved . it says israel did do this - so-called remediation - in four of the five units . however , the department declined to give any details of the incidents , the remediation , the units involved or evidence to support whether the remediation was effective . the us was reportedly on the brink of announcing it would cut military aid to the fifth unit , but says new information from israel means it will make a decision later . the unit involved is widely reported to be the netzah yehuda battalion , a special men-only unit set up in 1999 where ultra-orthodox jews serve . israel investigated the battalion over the death of 80-year-old palestinian-american omar assad who died after being bound and gagged by soldiers during a west bank village search in 2022 . at the time the us called for a "" thorough criminal investigation and full accountability "" . the israel defense forces ( idf ) later said they regretted mr assad's death , and a commander would be "" reprimanded "" and two soldiers barred from senior positions for two years - but would not be prosecuted . asked about reports an idf unit would be the first ever to face the us government designation under the leahy law , secretary of state antony blinken said on 19 april : "" i made determinations . you can expect to see them in the days ahead .

2024-04-30T15:59:49.000Z,BBC,"an iranian billionaire convicted of stealing nearly three billion dollars has had his death sentence commuted to a 20-year jail term . babak zanjani was convicted in 2016 of pocketing money from the oil ministry to circumvent us sanctions on iran . he said he had been unable to hand over the cash because of sanctions on him . the news comes after iran's judiciary said mr zanjani had agreed to work with authorities and his overseas assets had been transferred to iran . the announcement was made by a spokesperson for iran's judiciary , asghar jahangir , on tuesday , according to the judiciary-run mizan news agency . mr jahangir said the decision was taken after a request by the head of tehran's justice department , and approved by iran's judiciary chief and the country's supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei . iranian media have been speculating over mr zanjani's possible release after the judiciary announced in february that mr zanjani had agreed to work with the authorities , and that his assets abroad had been identified and transferred to iran . initial assessments were that the billionaire's overseas assets were "" sufficient to pay his debts and damages "" , the head of iran's judiciary was reported as saying in february . mr zanjani was one of iran's wealthiest men , and at one point controlled a network of more than 60 companies involved in everything from cosmetics production to oil and banking . at one stage he valued himself at around $ 13.5bn ( â£9.5bn ) , a huge figure especially for a businessman operating in a country where most of the economy is owned by the state and the private sector is restricted . he was one of the most high-profile iranian business figures to be targeted with asset freezes by the us and the eu for his role in helping the iranian government evade sanctions to sell oil abroad during the presidency of mahmoud ahmadinejad . the sanctions at the time were part of a drive by the international community to put pressure on the government in tehran over its controversial nuclear programme . mr zanjani was arrested in 2013 for withholding $ 2.7bn ( â£2.2bn ) of government money , and in 2016 was found guilty of "" corruption on earth "" - a capital offence used by iranian judiciary system to punish convicts on a range of charges .",gaza : israeli pm netanyahu says rafah attack will happen regardless of deal - bbc news

"" as soon as i heard his voice i started to cry , because i haven't heard his voice in half a year .

"" "" i don't even know what i was saying . i was just making noises and crying , and jon was crying "" . hersh goldberg-polin was at the nova music festival in a forested area close to the gaza strip when hamas-led gunmen stormed israel's border fence , killing about 1,200 people and seizing 253 hostages , according to israeli tallies . more than 360 of those killed were attending the festival event . hersh managed to get several kilometres away from the festival site in a car , before seeking refuge in a roadside bomb shelter with several dozen others . but outside , hamas gunmen gathered and began throwing in grenades . before wednesday , the last time he had been seen alive was in a hamas video that showed him being loaded on to a pick-up truck , with part of his left arm missing . in the new video , posted to hamas's telegram account , hersh lifts his arm to the camera to show a healed stump where his hand should be . he criticises israel's military campaign in gaza before speaking directly to his parents and two sisters , urging them to keep campaigning for his release . "" we're clearly very concerned about the injury , "" mrs goldberg-polin told me . "" we've had several surgeons who have seen the video that say he needs another surgery immediately . if he was treated , it was an emergency treatment . he needs a second surgery at least .

"" as a 23-year-old man , hersh would not be expected to be included in the next batch of hostages whose release is being discussed , which includes woman and the elderly . but those with medical conditions also fall into the category to be freed , and so the family hope that he will be included - although they have not had any confirmation . mrs goldberg-polin says she is scheduled to meet the us secretary of state , antony blinken , on his latest visit to israel , which it is hoped will give further impetus to the negotiations . she had a clear message for all of the parties involved . "" i think that everyone here has leverage . everyone is using their leverage . but are they using it to the maximum ? the answer is clearly no . because we still have 133 people there in gaza . "" i am hopeful and optimistic . i'm really praying that all the parties , everyone decides that they're going to be courageous , be daring , and put an end to all the suffering in this region "" . it is expected that hamas will respond to the latest israeli proposal in the next 24 hours . the hope is that it can provide a foundation to negotiate a concrete deal , and not be rejected outright . the details are yet to be officially confirmed but are believed to involve the release of 33 hostages during a five to six week ceasefire . an as-yet-unspecified number of palestinian prisoners would be released from israeli jails . there is also believed to be a commitment to discuss a future end point for the war . but even as those discussions continue , israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu says he is planning a ground offensive in rafah regardless of the outcome . around 1.4 million displaced palestinians are sheltering there after fleeing their homes during the heavy fighting in northern and central parts of gaza . more than 34,500 people have been killed in gaza since 7 october , according to the territory's hamas-run health ministry . israel has been conducting a military campaign to destroy hamas and free the hostages . a deal agreed in november saw hamas release 105 hostages - most of them women and children - in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 palestinian prisoners in israeli jails .",easyjet suspends flights to israel until october

2024-05-02T17:01:54.000Z,BBC,"israeli officials are increasingly concerned that the international criminal court ( icc ) is planning to seek arrest warrants for their military and political leaders on suspicion of war crimes . reports suggest prime minister benjamin netanyahu could be among them . the icc , based in the hague , has been investigating israel's actions in the occupied territories for the past three years - and more recently the actions of hamas as well . it has the power to charge and try individuals for the most serious crimes under international law . it has previously issued arrest warrants for leaders including russia's vladimir putin , muammar gaddafi of libya , and ugandan warlord joseph kony . mr netanyahu has called the prospect of senior israel figures joining the wanted list "" an outrage of historic proportions "" , accusing the icc of attempting to paralyse israel's ability to defend itself . but the fact that he's chosen to make such strident public comments suggests that , behind the scenes , such a scenario is being actively discussed . while the icc has not confirmed the israeli claims , when chief prosecutor karim khan kc visited israel and the occupied west bank last december his message was a clear one . the british barrister toured the sites of hamas ' attacks in israeli villages close to the gaza fence , which hamas-led gunmen burst through on 7 october . he also met political leaders , and travelled to ramallah to speak to the families of palestinian victims about their experiences in gaza and the west bank . he condemned the violence suffered by civilians on both sides , and promised to investigate . "" all actors must comply with international humanitarian law , "" he clarified in a statement at the time . "" if you do not do so , do not complain when my office is required to act . "" mr khan said the 7 october attacks - in which hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people , mostly civilians , and seized 253 hostages , according to israeli tallies - represented "" some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity , crimes which the icc was established to address "" . in israel's case , his concerns were twofold . he stressed the obligation to conduct its military operation in gaza according to "" clear legal parameters that govern armed conflict "" . israel has been accused of failing to sufficiently protect civilians during its months-long bombardment , although it insists it takes all necessary measures to avoid casualties . the hamas-run health ministry in the territory says more than 34,500 people have been killed there since the war began , and that many of that number are children . mr khan also underlined the need for humanitarian aid to get into gaza , with access to food , water and medical supplies a basic right for civilians "" without further delay , and at pace and at scale "" . he also urged hamas not to divert or misuse the supplies when they did arrive , after accusations by israel that its members were looting trucks and stealing aid , stopping it from reaching the wider population . israel isn't a member of the icc and it says the court has no jurisdiction over it . but the court has ruled that since 2015 it does in fact have jurisdiction over the west bank , east jerusalem and gaza after the palestinians ratified its founding treaty , the rome statute , as the state of palestine . no western-style democracy has had an icc arrest warrant issued for its leader before . if it happens to mr netanyahu , he'll be the first . israelis have particular concerns about the stigma and potential isolation that would come with it . michael oren was israel's ambassador to the united states between 2009 and 2013 . he points to the recent case brought by south africa at the international court of justice ( icj ) , which accused israel of genocide against the palestinian population in gaza - an accusation israel vehemently rejects . in january , the court issued an interim ruling that ordered israel to take steps to prevent genocidal acts in gaza , but stopped short of telling it to stop its military offensive .

2024-05-02T17:01:54.000Z,BBC,"israeli officials are increasingly concerned that the international criminal court ( icc ) is planning to seek arrest warrants for their military and political leaders on suspicion of war crimes . reports suggest prime minister benjamin netanyahu could be among them . the icc , based in the hague , has been investigating israel's actions in the occupied territories for the past three years - and more recently the actions of hamas as well . it has the power to charge and try individuals for the most serious crimes under international law . it has previously issued arrest warrants for leaders including russia's vladimir putin , muammar gaddafi of libya , and ugandan warlord joseph kony . mr netanyahu has called the prospect of senior israel figures joining the wanted list "" an outrage of historic proportions "" , accusing the icc of attempting to paralyse israel's ability to defend itself . but the fact that he's chosen to make such strident public comments suggests that , behind the scenes , such a scenario is being actively discussed . while the icc has not confirmed the israeli claims , when chief prosecutor karim khan kc visited israel and the occupied west bank last december his message was a clear one . the british barrister toured the sites of hamas ' attacks in israeli villages close to the gaza fence , which hamas-led gunmen burst through on 7 october . he also met political leaders , and travelled to ramallah to speak to the families of palestinian victims about their experiences in gaza and the west bank . he condemned the violence suffered by civilians on both sides , and promised to investigate . "" all actors must comply with international humanitarian law , "" he clarified in a statement at the time . "" if you do not do so , do not complain when my office is required to act . "" mr khan said the 7 october attacks - in which hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people , mostly civilians , and seized 253 hostages , according to israeli tallies - represented "" some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity , crimes which the icc was established to address "" . in israel's case , his concerns were twofold . he stressed the obligation to conduct its military operation in gaza according to "" clear legal parameters that govern armed conflict "" . israel has been accused of failing to sufficiently protect civilians during its months-long bombardment , although it insists it takes all necessary measures to avoid casualties . the hamas-run health ministry in the territory says more than 34,500 people have been killed there since the war began , and that many of that number are children . mr khan also underlined the need for humanitarian aid to get into gaza , with access to food , water and medical supplies a basic right for civilians "" without further delay , and at pace and at scale "" . he also urged hamas not to divert or misuse the supplies when they did arrive , after accusations by israel that its members were looting trucks and stealing aid , stopping it from reaching the wider population . israel isn't a member of the icc and it says the court has no jurisdiction over it . but the court has ruled that since 2015 it does in fact have jurisdiction over the west bank , east jerusalem and gaza after the palestinians ratified its founding treaty , the rome statute , as the state of palestine . no western-style democracy has had an icc arrest warrant issued for its leader before . if it happens to mr netanyahu , he'll be the first . israelis have particular concerns about the stigma and potential isolation that would come with it . michael oren was israel's ambassador to the united states between 2009 and 2013 . he points to the recent case brought by south africa at the international court of justice ( icj ) , which accused israel of genocide against the palestinian population in gaza - an accusation israel vehemently rejects . in january , the court issued an interim ruling that ordered israel to take steps to prevent genocidal acts in gaza , but stopped short of telling it to stop its military offensive .

2024-05-06T21:25:37.000Z,BBC,"after months of on-off hard talking between belligerents and mediators , the time has come for hard decisions . hamas has agreed to a draft ceasefire deal , which is "" far from meeting israel's demands "" , according to israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu . he has still felt it necessary to dispatch a delegation to discuss it . israel agreed to a ceasefire offer at the end of april . the us secretary of state antony blinken said it was "" exceptionally generous "" . a big challenge for the negotiators in cairo is closing the gap between israel's version and the one accepted by hamas . diplomatic sources in qatar , which is part of the mediation effort with egypt and the united states , told me "" it is broadly the same as israel's proposal . just minor wordings changed and details "" . israel may decide that the differences are not minor . one major sticking point has been that hamas wants a ceasefire to be permanent , not temporary , and to be followed by an israeli withdrawal from gaza . if the us delegation , led by the cia chief william burns , believes the gaps can be bridged , mr netanyahu can expect pressure from washington to agree . until monday evening , israel's working assumption was that hamas would not accept a ceasefire proposal . benjamin netanyahu and his government , like most foreign observers , were blindsided when hamas announced its decision . there are two ways of looking at the hamas gambit . it can be seen as a desperate move by an organisation badly bloodied and almost broken by israel's long offensive . or it was an adroit political move , which has turned the pressure back on mr netanyahu . that explanation is more credible , as israel's plans and assumptions were upended by the offer . we know that israel was basing its moves in the next phase of the war on an assumption that yahya sinwar , the hamas chief in gaza who has been in hiding since 7 october , would never accept a ceasefire . israel used the absence of a ceasefire offer from hamas as an explanation for its decision to launch a military operation in gaza . the us is very clear that it is against any ground operation in rafah that could threaten the lives of more palestinian civilians . as israel warned around 100,000 palestinians to leave their homes at first light on monday , its defence minister yoav gallant told his us counterpart that there was no alternative to a rafah assault . that , he said , was because hamas had rejected every proposal for a temporary ceasefire and a release of hostages . only a few hours later , hamas made its announcement , calling israel's bluff . mr netanyahu is in a political bind . his governing style over more than 16 years as israel's leader has been characterised by a habit of putting off difficult choices . but now he is under severe pressure , from all sides , and however tempting it might be to play for time , this is a moment for decisions . the most intense pressure comes from two ultranationalist jewish extremists in his cabinet - finance minister bezalel smotrich and itamar ben gvir , minister for national security . mr netanyahu needs their votes to keep his coalition in power . they want israel to occupy rafah and have threatened to topple the government if he does not make it happen . for them , a ceasefire equals surrender . at the same time , families and supporters of israeli hostages have been demonstrating , blocking major roads to demand that israel makes a deal to get them back home . the hostage families have support in the war cabinet from benny gantz and gabi eisenkot , two opposition leaders who joined the cabinet after the 7 october attacks . they might leave the government if , in the absence of a ceasefire , the hostages stay put . the americans also want a deal . president biden's support for israel , even as its army killed huge numbers of palestinian civilians , is costing him political support . if mr biden decides that there is an acceptable version of a ceasefire to be had , he will push benjamin netanyahu to support it . the israeli leader would have to choose between his government's survival and the vital support the us president has given him in recent months . it is widely believed in israel that mr netanyahu wants to prolong the war to put off the moment of reckoning for his own part in the mistakes that gave hamas its opportunity on 7 october to kill around 1200 people , mostly israelis and take 240 hostages into gaza . a ceasefire would also mean that benjamin netanyahu has not achieved "" total victory "" over hamas - one of his two main war aims . the other is freeing the hostages , which he has not achieved either . this war is showing , once again , how hard it is for powerful countries like israel to defeat much weaker organisations like hamas . for hamas , survival means victory , and benjamin netanyahu knows that , for him , would be a defeat .",uk forces may be deployed on the ground in gaza to help deliver aid

2024-05-07T09:35:28.384Z,BBC,"many palestinians are fleeing eastern parts of rafah , after the israeli military ordered their evacuation before starting an operation in the southern gaza city.on monday the military told the tens of thousands of people affected to begin heading towards an “ expanded humanitarian area "" to the north , where it said they would find field hospitals , tents and basic supplies.but palestinians warned that the area was made up of neighbourhoods that were already overcrowded and lacking in essential services , were still coming under intense bombardment , or had been left in ruins by recent fighting . almost seven months into its war against hamas , senior israeli government and military figures have insisted that victory is impossible without a full-scale ground assault on rafah . but israel’s closest ally , the us , has said it has yet to see a credible plan to protect the more than a million displaced palestinians sheltering there - half of them children.in march , the israel defense forces ( idf ) said it was intending to evacuate most , if not all , of the civilians in rafah ahead of major offensive and send them to “ humanitarian islands ” in central gaza where aid and tents would be provided.it appeared that plan was being at least partly put into action , when the idf announced the evacuation of eastern rafah and the “ expansion of the humanitarian area ” in nearby al-mawasi as part of its preparations for ground operations there . “ this expanded humanitarian area includes field hospitals , tents and increased amounts of food , water , medication and additional supplies , ” an idf statement said.an idf spokesperson said the evacuation would be “ gradual ” and affect an estimated 100,000 residents and displaced people . however , a palestinian red crescent official put the figure at 250,000 and a un official said many others would be on the move because they feared this was only “ the first phase in a longer operation ” . flyers dropped by israeli aircraft over rafah on monday featured a map that identifies nine area blocks in south-eastern rafah , including al-shokat , al-salam , al-jneineh , tabbet zarei and al-yarmouk , as well as open land around the israeli-controlled kerem shalom and egyptian-controlled rafah border crossings.the un said the evacuation zone covered more than 30 sq km ( 12 sq miles ) and was home to nine sites sheltering displaced people , as well as three clinics and six warehouses.the flyer instructed all residents to evacuate immediately and head towards an approximately 60 sq km area stretching north along the mediterranean coast from al-mawasi - a narrow strip of agricultural land that has long been an idf-designated “ humanitarian zone ” - to the city of khan younis and the central town of deir al-balah.the idf did not provide any details about the locations of the tents for the people being evacuated , but in recent weeks satellite images have shown several encampments constructed north of rafah and west of khan younis . mohammed daoud said the 35 members of his family living had “ no choice but to leave ” after finding out that their house in the oraiba area was inside the evacuation zone . “ we do not know where to go and how we will manage , ” he told the bbc.rasha sheikh khalil , a displaced woman living in a tent in rafah with her husband and four children , said : “ i had started preparing my bags and getting ready to return to my neighbourhood in gaza city , but the bad news [ on monday ] surprised us . ” “ no-one cares about our fate . for seven months we have not tasted comfort and tranquillity . ” ghada el-kurd , a mother-of-two who has been displaced six times over the last four months , told the bbc that she was living only 15 minutes away from one of the evacuated areas but was staying put for now . “ i’m so confused . . . i have no place to go . this was the last place i know , ” she said . “ if i want to come back to khan younis there is no place - it is all destroyed . [ as for ] areas of al-mawasi , they are crowded and i cannot any more live inside a tent - it’s so hot and my health does not allow me to be in such a situation . regarding deir al-balah . . . there are a lot of air strikes there . . . and it is a very dangerous area . ” the un said it was “ not taking part in involuntary evacuations or in the setting up of any displacement zones ” . but james elder , a spokesman for the un children’s agency , unicef , who was in gaza last month , said ghada el-kurd’s assessment of the idf’s humanitarian area was “ absolutely spot on ” . "" there's nowhere to go . khan younis , let's be clear , is rubble , ” he told the bbc . “ i've walked around those streets of khan younis . it's not a little bit destroyed , it's utterly devastated . ” “ deir al-balah . . . has now got raw sewage running through the streets because sanitation has just been devastated , and al-mawasi is a beach , a sandy area , and we're starting to hit summer . ” “ we've already had reports of children dying of dehydration . so when we're told that people should move to humanitarian zones , that's a terrifying irony when humanitarians aren't working in these zones . "" but , he added : “ of course , families will move . they will move because they will move or be bombed . ” mr elder said the aid operation in gaza was already very fragile because it was “ continually undermined by bombings , by insecurity , by denial of access ” , but that an israeli offensive in rafah could push it to breaking point.un officials are particularly concerned that the rafah and kerem shalom crossings - the key entry points for aid into gaza - could be closed during the current israeli operation in eastern gaza.kerem shalom was shut on sunday after four israeli soldiers there were killed by 10 rockets launched by hamas fighters from an area near the rafah crossing , according to the idf . but israel’s prime minister told the us president on monday that he would ensure kerem shalom reopened for humanitarian assistance.kerem shalom was still closed on tuesday morning , when the idf announced that its troops had "" obtained operational control "" of the gazan side of the rafah crossing . the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa - which runs the largest humanitarian operation in gaza - has said it will maintain a presence in rafah as long as possible and would continue providing lifesaving aid.but it has also warned that the continued interruption of the entry of aid and fuel supplies at the rafah crossing would "" halt the critical humanitarian response "" across gaza . "" the catastrophic hunger faced by people especially in northern gaza will get much worse if these supply routes are interrupted , "" the agency said in a post on x , formerly twitter , on tuesday.the idf has said it is committed to facilitating humanitarian aid into and within gaza and that it has established alternative crossings , including two in the north .",the us doctor who cannot forget what he saw in gaza

2024-05-07T18:51:50.000Z,BBC,"after months of stalemate , the search for peace in gaza has reached a critical stage . un chief antonio guterres says it is a "" decisive moment for the palestinian and israeli people and for the fate of the entire region "" . there seems to be common ground between most sides about the principles : a ceasefire should take place alongside the release of israeli hostages and palestinian prisoners . various draft agreements have been drawn up , setting out a complex process of how it would all work . there is some disagreement over the detail of what should happen to whom and when and in what order . israeli officials say , for example , that its female soldiers should be released earlier than envisaged . they also say the texts should be clearer that the first 33 hostages to be released must be alive and are worried about not having a veto over which palestinian prisoners would be released . these are issues that could potentially be surmounted through negotiation . but there is a more fundamental sticking point about a core principle that may be harder to get past and that is when the war should end . the opening words of the draft agreement - supported by hamas - declares that there should be a "" temporary cessation of military operations between the two parties "" . this is largely unproblematic . six weeks would pass while people are released , israeli forces withdraw from some areas , displaced gazans would be able to return to what if anything is left of their homes . but then stage two would begin . the draft agreement then talks about a "" return to sustainable calm "" , which it defines as "" a permanent cessation of military and hostile operations "" . it is this that seems to be unacceptable to israel's government . in a statement , the prime minister benjamin netanyahu said : "" israel will not allow hamas to restore its evil rule in the gaza strip , israel will not allow it to restore its military capabilities to continue striving for our destruction . israel cannot accept a proposal that endangers the security of our citizens and the future of our country . "" in other words , israel's government wants the right to continue taking the fight to hamas in the long run . by contrast , hamas wants a permanent ceasefire . what is not clear is whether there is a way for qatari , egyptian and american negotiators to find a middle path through this . it may be that all of this is part of the negotiation . public statements are frequently used in negotiations to put pressure on the other side . the announcement by hamas that it supports a particular draft could be an attempt to push israel into making concessions and divide it from its allies . israel's warnings about an imminent military operation in rafah could be an attempt to extract better terms from hamas . but the question of whether any ceasefire is permanent or not looks hard to square with clever diplomatic language . israel has agreed to send a delegation to cairo but with modest ambitions - not to hammer out a deal but "" to exhaust the possibility of reaching an agreement under conditions acceptable to israel "" . much will depend on what the us government decides . so far , us spokespeople have fallen over themselves to avoid making any comment on the deal hamas has signed up to . they have limited themselves to asserting that an agreement is still "" achievable "" and to warning firmly against a military operation in rafah . that is because if the us were to throw its weight behind the current text , then mr netanyahu might be forced to choose between his main ally and the ultra-nationalist hardliners propping up his government who oppose any compromise . mr netanyahu has survived many crises in his political career by postponing difficult decisions . but president biden has it in his gift to force israel's leader to make a choice that he might rather avoid .",parties pressed over funding of election pledges

"" this doctor knew i was jewish , and just days after october 7th he started expressing support for hamas , repeatedly shouting , ' you're a baby-killer ' , in my face . "" the doctor said he was left "" extremely upset , horrified and shaken "" by the harassment at work . "" i've never before had it in such a blatant way inside a hospital - a place which is supposed to be the ultimate safe space . "" the bbc understands that the hospital concerned is investigating all aspects of the case , including the antisemitism allegations . from the start of 2023 , the gmc received eight complaints about antisemitism by doctors.however , in the four months after the hamas attacks , 60 medical professionals were reported for alleged antisemitic conduct or remarks against their colleagues across the uk . of these 60 complaints , 22 are currently undergoing "" triage "" , a process where the gmc determines whether a complaint should proceed to a full investigation . according to the gmc , 1,903 doctors identified as jewish in 2023 , the most recent data available . this is roughly 1 % of licensed doctors in the uk . the gmc figures , obtained via a freedom of information request by the bbc , also show an uptick in complaints about islamophobia by doctors since 7 october , with 16 cases from october through to january compared to three in the preceding nine months . there are 53,359 doctors in the uk who identify as muslim - 17 % of doctors - according to the latest figures from the regulator.of the 16 complaints made after 7 october , 12 are in triage and four have been closed . dr salman waqar , of the british islamic medical association , said while the figures showed an increase in islamophobic incidents , it was difficult to give an accurate representation of the problem within the nhs . "" people tend not to report it because of fear . in the medical profession , most muslim colleagues aren't senior yet . we aren't hearing about the worst cases as much as we should , "" dr waqar said.he said there were many who worried if they were to complain , they would lose their visas.he described examples of muslim doctors facing exclusion , such as being left out of important email chains or meetings and other cases , where muslim doctors reported feeling abandoned by colleagues who failed to speak up when patients made islamophobic remarks . "" these figures are creating a system of ' us and them ' and shouldn't come across like we're in the ' racism olympics ' , "" dr waqar said.he also criticised the gmc for following a "" common sense "" definition of antisemitism and islamophobia , rather than working with groups to establish a clearer , more precise definition . for the jewish community , the rise in antisemitism complaints against medical professionals has been particularly disturbing , mirroring an overall trend in the uk since 7 october.dr dave rich from the community security trust , a charity that monitors antisemitism , said : "" it is shocking to see this happening within the medical profession - the one part of society where we expect everybody to behave with complete professionalism and neutrality . "" dr rich said his organisation had received "" quite unusual "" reports from jewish medics about "" things either said to them , or posted online , or other kinds of antisemitic behaviour from colleagues "" in recent months . he called it "" really disappointing to see this playing out "" in the wake of an overseas conflict.dr rich said jewish medical professionals were being singled out by their colleagues simply due to their identity . "" the vast majority of incidents that we record involve visibly jewish people or jewish organisations being singled out simply because they are jewish , and either harassed or threatened , or treated as if they are somehow to blame or responsible for anything israel has done , simply because they are jewish , "" dr rich said . the jewish medical association's prof david katz accused the gmc of being "" sluggish "" and "" unclear "" over its criteria for determining and resolving cases of alleged antisemitism.he believes the reported incidents are "" just the tip of the iceberg "" , with some jewish doctors hesitant to come forward . "" there's a question that the wish to avoid identifying yourself too publicly as jewish remains a strong one , which reflects maybe a little on the nature of the underlying host society , "" prof katz said . the professional standards authority , which oversees the gmc , has previously been warned by health secretary victoria atkins that it is "" vital for public confidence "" that "" any instances of extremism , discrimination or hate speech are dealt with in a thorough and timely manner "" . a gmc spokesperson told the bbc : "" we recognise the significant impact the ongoing conflict has on members of the profession , patients , and all those affected .

2024-05-08T09:43:36.000Z,BBC,"fighting and bombardment continued on the outskirts of the southern gaza city of rafah as israel said the key kerem shalom crossing had reopened for aid . the israeli military said troops had killed hamas fighters in eastern rafah as part of a "" precise "" counterterrorism operation . hamas also reported battles . earlier , the military said lorries had reached kerem shalom , which was closed after a hamas rocket attack on sunday . but the un says no supplies have passed through the crossing yet . the us said that while the crossing was open again , aid could not get through "" because of logistical and security concerns "" on the ground . the un had expressed alarm on tuesday over what it called israel's "" choking-off "" of gaza's two main aid arteries , after israeli troops took full control of the palestinian side of the nearby rafah crossing with egypt . the closing of the rafah crossing is of particular concern because of the consequences for fuel deliveries - the un says all of its fuel enters there . "" without fuel , trucks cannot move critical humanitarian assistance , water pumps will stop functioning and the remaining hospitals will shut down , "" philippe lazzarini , the head of the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa , wrote on social media on wednesday . world health organization head tedros adhanom ghebreyesus warned that hospitals in the south of gaza had only three days of fuel left . plumes of smoke from israeli air strikes were seen over rafah and heavy gunfire was heard on wednesday , as the israel defense forces ( idf ) said troops were continuing a limited offensive in eastern areas . residents of rafah reported intense bombardment overnight and video footage on wednesday morning showed people searching through the rubble of a building destroyed in one of the strikes . "" we are in a safe area according to the army's map - an area without operations , "" neighbour reda al-najili told reuters news agency . "" we were sitting when suddenly the explosion happened . our neighbour's house was gone , and our house was all damaged internally . in the house there are only civilians . women died . those who were injured were all children . "" palestinian medics also said seven members of one family , including five children , were killed in an overnight strike on a home in the zeitoun neighbourhood of gaza city , in the north of the territory . an idf statement issued on wednesday morning said they had "" eliminated terrorists and uncovered terrorist infrastructure , as well as underground shafts in several locations "" during several encounters over the previous day . they were also carrying out raids on the gazan side of the rafah crossing , it added . the idf also said aircraft had struck more than 100 "" terror targets "" throughout gaza over the same period . seven months into its war with hamas in gaza , israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking rafah . but with more than a million displaced palestinians taking refuge there from the fighting elsewhere , the un and western powers have warned that an all-out assault could have devastating humanitarian consequences . negotiations on a new ceasefire and hostage release deal have resumed in cairo , with the us saying it believes a revised hamas proposal could lead to a breakthrough . the israeli military played down the significance of the us government's decision to halt a shipment of powerful bombs over concerns that israel was about to launch a major offensive on rafah city . however , us president joe biden later warned that the us would stop supplying some weapons if israel launched a major ground operation in rafah . the israeli military has ordered the evacuation of an estimated 100,000 residents and displaced people in a number of eastern neighbourhoods and told them they will find field hospitals , tents and aid in an "" expanded humanitarian area "" , which stretches north from al-mawasi to the city of khan younis and central town of deir al-balah . meanwhile , the director general of the world health organization said one of the three hospitals in rafah , al-najjar , was "" no longer functioning due to the ongoing hostilities in its vicinity and the military operation in rafah "" . dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus also warned that the partially functioning kuwaiti and emirati hospitals would soon run out of fuel unless the un received a delivery . "" hospitals in the south of gaza only have three days of fuel left , which means services may soon come to a halt , "" he added . the who has also said the european gaza hospital in khan younis , where critical patients from rafah are referred , may also become unreachable . a displaced man sheltering at the hospital told bbc arabic's gaza today programme that life was very difficult for him . "" i suffer from diabetes , high blood pressure , and osteoarthritis - a matter which means the displacement causes a great deal of suffering for me , "" he said . "" we hope to return to our land in gaza and that everyone will set up a tent in the place of his home and settle back there . "" on wednesday morning , the idf announced the reopening of kerem shalom for humanitarian aid . "" trucks from egypt carrying humanitarian aid , including food , water , shelter equipment , medicine and medical equipment donated by the international community are already arriving at the crossing , "" it said . "" after a thorough security inspection by the security personnel . . . the equipment will be transferred to the gazan side of the crossing . "" the military also said the recently reopened erez crossing with northern gaza was continuing to operate . however , the un aid agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa - which is the largest humanitarian organisation in gaza - reported that it had not received any gaza aid via kerem shalom or rafah , which remains closed . "" we're not receiving any aid into the gaza strip , the rafah crossing area has ongoing military operations - there have been continued bombardments in this area throughout the day , "" said scott anderson , senior deputy director of unrwa affairs in gaza . "" no fuel or aid has entered into gaza strip and this is disastrous for the humanitarian response . "" an israeli government spokesman disputed unrwa's assertion and insisted aid was going through kerem shalom . "" it is open and i would ask the un why , day in and day out , there is so much surplus on the gaza side of kerem shalom that is not being distributed , "" avi hyman told a briefing . kerem shalom is the key entry point for aid into gaza , but israel closed it on sunday after four israeli soldiers were killed by rockets launched by hamas from the area of the rafah crossing , according to the israeli military . another six projectiles were fired at kerem shalom from the rafah area on tuesday , but no casualties were reported . the second attack happened hours after israeli tanks rolled into the palestinian side of the rafah crossing . un secretary general antónio guterres said he was "" disturbed and distressed "" by the israeli military activity in rafah . he also warned that the closure of both rafah and kerem shalom crossings was "" especially damaging to an already dire humanitarian situation "" and demanded that they be reopened immediately . mr guterres urged israel and hamas to "" spare no effort "" to agree a ceasefire , warning that the fate of the entire region was facing a "" decisive moment "" . on monday , israel declared that a three-phase proposal for a ceasefire and the release of hostages approved by hamas was unacceptable . the white house spokesman , john kirby , said a revised text hamas had since put forward suggested remaining gaps could "" absolutely be closed "" . israel launched a military campaign in gaza to destroy hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern israel on 7 october , during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage . more than 34,840 people have been killed in gaza since then , according to the territory's hamas-run health ministry . a deal agreed in november saw hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 palestinian prisoners in israeli jails . israel says 128 hostages are unaccounted for , 36 of whom are presumed dead .",keith siegel and omri miran : video shows us and israeli hostages alive in gaza
2024-05-08T10:10:21.000Z,BBC,"police arrested 33 people at george washington university ( gw ) early wednesday after officers moved to clear a pro-palestinian encampment on campus . washington dc police told the bbc that protestors were arrested for assaults on a police officer and unlawful entry . university students had been inside the encampment since 25 april . house republicans cancelled scheduled testimony by mayor muriel bowser following the arrests after pressuring dc officials to clear the protests . the police operation came a week after six republican members of the house of representatives oversight committee visited the gw protest encampment and called on officials to arrest protesters involved . wednesday's move to clear the encampment was made ahead of a planned appearance by ms bowser and metropolitan police department chief pamela smith before the house oversight committee on the city's handling of the unrest . in a statement , the chair of the house oversight committee , republican representative james comer , announced that appearance was being cancelled and said he was "" pleased that the potential oversight hearing led to swift action by mayor bowser "" . according to a report on the arrests by gw hatchet , the university's independent student-run newspaper : "" officers gave their third and final warning to demonstrators to move at about 03:30 local time , saying all who remained in u-yard and the stretch of h street in front of the plaza would be arrested . "" the newspaper reported that some protestors who refused to leave were pepper sprayed by police . in a statement , the university said police "" conducted an orderly and safe operation to disperse the demonstrators from the illegal encampment on the gw's university yard "" . they added there were no reports of serious injuries during the arrests . previously , despite gw's efforts to offer an alternative protest site , the encampment remained . university officials say they are unsure how many of the demonstrators were students . "" while the university is committed to protecting students ' rights to free expression , the encampment had evolved into an unlawful activity , with participants in direct violation of multiple university policies and city regulations , "" a previous gw statement said . tensions had grown in recent days after police removed a large palestinian flag that demonstrators had raised above a campus building . the university called the flag's hoisting an "" aggressive act of lawlessness "" . metro police told the bbc there has been "" a gradual escalation in the volatility "" of the protest and , as a result , officers moved in . "" therefore , this morning , working closely with the gw administration and police , mpd moved to disperse the demonstrators from the gw campus and surrounding streets , "" the statement added . gw said it remains open and operating as normal , but additional security personnel have been deployed to university yard and the surrounding area . the yard will remain closed until the end of commencement ceremonies on 19 may , the university added . there have been heated demonstrations at a number of universities across the country against the war in gaza . since the 7 october attack by hamas and israel's retaliatory assault , students have launched rallies , sit-ins , fasts and , most recently , encampments against the war . according to a bbc tally , there have been pro-palestine protests at 45 states and washington dc since the demonstrations started at columbia university in new york on 17 april . they are demanding that their schools , many with massive endowments , financially divest from israel . many also want their universities to end academic relationships with israeli institutions . previously , president joe biden said people had the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos . but , mr biden warned on tuesday the threat of antisemitism is growing in the us , including on college campuses , joining a heated american debate about jewish security , zionism , free speech and support for israel , in the country with the largest jewish population after israel . addressing a bipartisan audience at the us holocaust memorial museum's annual commemoration , mr biden said : "" this hatred ( of jews ) continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness , "" biden said .

2024-05-08T20:57:12.000Z,BBC,"hundreds of gaza's water and sanitation facilities have been damaged or destroyed since israel began military action against hamas , satellite analysis by bbc verify has found . damage to a major supplies depot has also severely disrupted repairs . the lack of clean water and flows of untreated sewage pose a serious threat to health , say aid agencies . the israel defense forces told the bbc that hamas cynically exploits civilian infrastructure for terror purposes . the destruction comes despite israel's duty to protect critical infrastructure under the rules of war , unless there is evidence sites are being used for military reasons , say human rights lawyers . clean water has always been a limited resource in gaza and the territory has largely relied on a system of boreholes and desalination plants for its supply . our analysis found that more than half of these vital facilities have been damaged or destroyed since israel launched its retaliation in gaza after hamas attacked on 7 october . we also found that four of the six wastewater treatment plants - crucial to preventing the build-up of sewage and the spread of disease - have been damaged or destroyed . the two others have shut down because lack of fuel or other supplies , according to one aid agency . the plants were among more than 600 water and sanitation facilities that we analysed , using a list of locations provided by gaza's coastal municipalities water utility ( cmwu ) . in one satellite image , of khan younis in the south of gaza , two damaged large water storage tanks can be seen . the destruction of water and sanitation facilities has led to "" disastrous health consequences for the population "" , said dr natalie roberts , executive director of medecins sans frontieres uk . "" the rates of diarrhoeal disease have gone catastrophically high , "" she said . in very severe cases , such disease can kill young children and the vulnerable . rates of hepatitis a - found in contaminated water and particularly dangerous for pregnant women - are also high , according to the charity . "" this is killing people , "" dr roberts said . there is a particular spike in disease in rafah in the south where many gazans have fled to , dr roberts said , and a risk of cholera . there has been widespread damage to buildings across gaza since hamas attacked israel on 7 october . according to the un , about 69,000 housing units have been destroyed and a further 290,000 damaged . homes are now "" very unlikely "" to have running water , according to aid workers we spoke to . to carry out this analysis we sought advice from experts at the un and human rights watch on the best approach . for each site , we sourced the most recent high resolution satellite imagery and compared each shot with an image taken prior to 7 october . we then marked a facility as destroyed or damaged if the closest structure to the given co-ordinates appeared to be reduced to rubble , partially collapsed , or showed other signs of damage . bbc verify has not distinguished between "" destroyed "" and "" damaged "" facilities . this is because without knowing the precise outline of each facility , we cannot say whether it has been partly damaged or completely destroyed . water wells usually consist of an underground borehole and electric pump , together with a small control room above ground . however , as the control room is not always visible or easily identifiable we had to rely on analysing the nearest visible buildings when assessing damage . of the 603 water facilities we analysed , 53 % appeared to have been damaged or destroyed since 7 october . a further 43 facilities were in areas that showed some damage or where solar panels had been removed , but we were unable to determine whether the water facility itself had been damaged so these were not included in our analysis . the latest available satellite images were acquired in march and april , and our analysis has been ongoing since april . the majority of sites identified as destroyed or damaged are in northern gaza or in the area around the southern city of khan younis . at one wastewater facility in bureij , in the centre of the strip , solar panels that power the plant had been obliterated and sewage treatment tanks appeared to have algae growing on the surface . not all damage is visible from satellite images , so our analysis may have missed some affected facilities . some sites also may not be fully operational due to a lack of fuel . for example , the unicef desalination plant in deir al-balah - one of three large seawater facilities in gaza - can only work at 30 % capacity because of lack of fuel , unicef told the bbc . with most gazans now displaced from their homes , and living in tented camps , the build-up of sewage in the streets is even more of a threat . "" the pumps for sewage are not operating and the streets are flooded [ with it ] , "" said muhammad atallah , who works for the palestinian centre for human rights . the conflict has already made water facility repair difficult for gaza's water authority , but a strike on a key maintenance warehouse has made it harder still . the building , in the neighbourhood of al-mawasi , was severely damaged in a missile strike on 21 january . four people died and 20 others were injured , according to the cmwu . monther shoblaq , the director general of cmwu , told the bbc this warehouse , which acted as a depot for both the cmwu and unicef , contained more than 2,000 items used for maintenance , and was the heart of the water and sanitation services in gaza . its destruction has severely limited cmwu's ability to repair and maintain vital facilities such as water pipelines , he said . the idf said the warehouse was not targeted , but that hamas terrorists operating nearby were struck and "" it is possible that parts of the warehouse suffered damage as a result of the strike "" . we gave the idf a sample of five other damaged or destroyed water sites from our analysis . in one case , the idf denied there had been an air strike , in the four other cases it said hamas fighters or sites were the actual targets . "" hamas stores its weapons and ammunition within these civilian structures , constructs terror infrastructure beneath them , and from them , launches its attacks … the idf is locating and destroying these terror infrastructures , which have been discovered , among other places , in and near the water facilities in question . "" leila sadat , a former special adviser on crimes against humanity at the international criminal court , told the bbc that facilities critical to the survival of civilians should be protected unless a military body has some concrete evidence to suggest otherwise . to assess war actions in terms of legality , you need to consider "" the pattern "" of those actions , she said . "" you can't just look strike by strike … [ t]hey [ the idf ] have hit water pipes , tanks , reservoirs , and infrastructure , "" she said . "" to take out over half of water and sanitation would be very difficult without intentionally doing so . so the pattern is evidence of either a reckless approach to civilian objects or the intentional destruction of them ; these were not all mistakes , "" she added . in response to our findings , sara elizabeth dill , an international criminal and human rights lawyer , said : "" what we are seeing is essentially siege warfare and the total destruction of gaza , without regard for human life or human decency , or any attempts to comply with international law .

"" we're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells , "" mr biden said in the interview , which aired on wednesday . israel's ambassador to the un said the country was "" very disappointed "" by mr biden's intervention . "" if israel is restricted from entering an area as important and central as rafah where there are thousands of terrorists , hostages and leaders of hamas , how exactly are we supposed to achieve our goals ? "" he said on public radio . mr biden told cnn that the us did not define the current situation in rafah as a ground operation . "" they haven't gone into the population centres . what they did is right on the border , "" he said .

israel is cumulatively the world’s largest ever recipient of us lethal aid.col buccino says the paused shipment is “ somewhat inconsequential ” to any assault assault on rafah . “ it's like a little bit of a political play for people in the united states who are … concerned about this , ” he says.whether that is the case or not , it has not blunted the political fallout from mr biden’s move . in the halls of the us senate , republicans were seething . “ i think that pause is absolutely outrageous , ” said us senator pete ricketts , speaking to me outside a meeting of the foreign relations committee . “ the president really has no business doing this . ” when i put it to him that israel still has the means to carry out its stated planned assault , he replied : “ this is about supporting our ally israel against a terrorist organisation . ” another republican senator , john barrasso , said that israel had a right to “ do what they want to do to protect their sovereignty ” . for him mr biden’s move demonstrated one thing : “ a weakness of this president . ” but within mr biden’s own party , there has been a warmer reception for the shift . democratic senator chris coons two months ago called for restrictions on military assistance to israel if it launched an assault into rafah “ at scale ” , without significant changes in how palestinian civilians were treated and protected . “ the conflict in gaza … has led to a lot of painful reflection for many of us who count ourselves as strong supporters of israel but are also very concerned about suffering and the humanitarian conditions , ” he says.he believes the president has tried “ over and over ” to restrain mr netanyahu but that tensions have grown because the israeli leader relies on the political support of ultranationalists who oppose humanitarian aid going to gaza and want to expel palestinians from the west bank . “ this may be the first real break , ” says mr coons.the “ break ” with mr netanyahu also comes at a critical moment in attempts to reach a ceasefire in exchange for the release of hostages held by hamas . talks in cairo broke up earlier this week without apparent resolution.some israeli commentators have suggested that mr biden’s move will compromise the hostage negotiations - that any attempt to blunt the threat of an israeli assault on rafah would benefit hamas.the running details of the talks are , however , mostly opaque , making it hard to definitively assess the claim . the biggest stumbling block is over hamas ’ demand for a permanent end to the war , which israel rejects.the relationship between mr biden and mr netanyahu goes back five decades , and has been turbulent for just as long.when they were both young men , mr biden said he signed a picture which later sat on mr netanyahu’s desk , writing : “ bibi , i love you , but i don’t agree with a damn thing you have to say . ” mr netanyahu has often praised the president for his support of israel , but they have fallen out frequently over major policy issues relating to the palestinians.less than a fortnight after the october 7 attacks , mr biden flew to israel and embraced mr netanyahu on the tarmac in tel aviv . i was there as mr biden emerged from a meeting with the israeli leader and his war cabinet and stood at a podium to assert his unstinting support for israel . but he had a warning : don’t repeat the mistakes we made after the 9/11 attacks . and he spelled out what he meant : “ the palestinian people are suffering greatly as well , and we mourn the loss of innocent palestinian lives like the entire world . ” mr biden’s wartime trip takes on further significance in hindsight : the start of an attempt to prevent a near unprecedented break in the us-israel relationship , which inched closer this week.on thursday , the day after mr biden announced the weapons shipment pause , mr netanyahu fired back . the prime minister has long understood that he can rally his own base with shows of defiance to us pressure . “ if we need to stand alone , we will stand alone . i have said that if necessary we will fight with our fingernails , ” he said.i put mr netanyahu’s statement to chris coons , the democratic senator . “ they don't need to fight with their fingernails , ” he said . “ they will and should fight with modern weapons systems that they have developed in many cases jointly with us , that are provided in many cases by us . ” “ but they should do it in a way that minimises civilian casualties , ” he said .",alarm in israel at reports of possible icc legal action over gaza

2024-05-13T10:37:23.053Z,BBC,"lebanon is worried that israel might intensify its offensive against the lebanon-based shia militant group hezbollah , the country’s foreign minister has said , as the conflict between the two sides escalates along the border.in an interview with the bbc , abdallah bou habib said it was unlikely israeli forces would cross into lebanon but that there could be more fierce air strikes.israel and hezbollah have exchanged near-daily strikes and counter-strikes since october , when hezbollah launched rockets at israel in support of the palestinians in gaza a day after the deadly hamas attack on israel.the violence has killed civilians , israeli soldiers and hezbollah fighters and led to the displacement of tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border , raising fears of another major confrontation between hezbollah and israel , which fought a devastating month-long war in 2006 . “ as a government , we’re concerned , ” mr bou habib said in the interview in beirut . “ if there’s an escalation , it’ll be from the skies . . . i don’t think israel will [ carry out ] a land invasion . . . whatever they want to achieve from land , they can achieve from the skies , and they have dominance in the skies . ” about 60,000 people from northern israel remain evacuated and israel has reinforced military positions near the frontier , while repeatedly threatening to expand the offensive against hezbollah if diplomacy fails to de-escalate the situation.last week , defence minister yoav gallant warned of a “ hot summer ” along the border , days after saying a war would mean “ catastrophe ” for hezbollah and lebanon.it remains unclear , however , what an escalation of israel’s campaign could involve , and whether the israel defense forces ( idf ) would be able to fight on two fronts simultaneously , as the war against hamas in gaza continues.a wider conflict would be damaging for israel too . hezbollah - iranian-backed and long considered by israel to be a much more formidable enemy than hamas - has an arsenal that includes precision-guided missiles able to strike deep into israeli territory . “ the [ israeli ] minister of defence has been saying , ‘ we’ll return lebanon to the stone age ' [ in the event of a war with hezbollah ] . [ but ] we’re neighbours , no matter what , geographically , and i don’t think he wants a country in the stone age next to his . [ because ] that means he’ll be in trouble as well , ” mr bou habib said . “ i think these words , a lot of [ western ] ambassadors tell us , are for domestic consumption , more than for us . ” mr bou habib’s comments came at the end of a particularly violent week on both sides of the border . israeli attacks killed at least seven people in southern lebanon , including two hezbollah fighters and a technician who had been fixing a phone tower , according to local authorities . in israel , the idf said hezbollah attacks killed three of its soldiers in the north of the country.since october , israeli strikes have killed more than 350 people in lebanon , mostly fighters belonging to hezbollah and allied groups but also more than 50 civilians . in israel , attacks from lebanon have killed more than 20 people , including at least a dozen soldiers.hezbollah says the attacks with rockets , anti-tank missiles and explosive drones are in support of hamas , aimed at diverting israeli troops from gaza to the border with lebanon . both groups are considered terrorist organisations by the uk , the us and others , and are part of the so-called axis of resistance , an alliance of factions across the middle east supported by iran.in southern lebanon , a hezbollah stronghold , villages are empty as an estimated 90,000 residents have fled . houses and other buildings lie destroyed while agricultural fields have been burned by white phosphorus dropped by israel , mr bou habib said . experts have warned that those strikes are likely to have a long-term impact on the environment , which could make the areas uninhabitable.until now , the attacks have been largely contained to areas along the lebanon-israel border , as hezbollah has taken steps to avoid sparking an all-out conflict . israeli strikes , however , have increasingly hit targets deep inside lebanon , including the eastern city of baalbek , another hezbollah stronghold.lebanon’s government , which has limited influence over the group , has called for the full implementation of the united nations security council resolution 1701 , to solve the current israel-hezbollah conflict . the text was approved to end the 2006 war , which started after hezbollah killed eight israeli soldiers and kidnapped two others in a cross-border attack.the resolution includes the withdrawal of armed groups from southern lebanon , between the litani river and the blue line , the unofficial frontier with israel . both countries have accused each other of violations , while lebanon says israel still holds lebanese territory , after the israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon in 2000 - something israel and the un deny . “ as long as we have occupied land , and we have , we can’t stop the [ hezbollah ] resistance . that's the problem , ” mr bou habib said . “ that's why we want a lasting border [ like ] they have with jordan and egypt . it may not be accompanied by a peace treaty , but there will be peace on the borders . ” us envoy amos hochstein and france , which has historic ties with lebanon , have led recent efforts to reduce tensions . hezbollah has said any permanent deal can only be negotiated after the end of the israel-hamas war , but that it will observe in lebanon any ceasefire in gaza.additional reporting by samantha granville , ghaith elsolh and jonathan dunstan",more than 200 university staff back pro-palestine protesters

"" we need all the parties to the conflict to agree to make sure the truck drivers and the un staff undertaking this operation are safe , "" he said . part of the un's operations in gaza throughout the war has been to survey displaced palestinians who are on the move , and track those who say they do not have access to food and water . unrwa is currently tracking some 370,000 palestinians in gaza , mr anderson said . hundreds of thousands of palestinians have heeded israel's warnings to evacuate eastern rafah and have begun their journey to what israel has called an "" expanded humanitarian zone "" . this includes al-mawasi , a coastal area largely made up of sand dunes , and parts of khan younis , which only recently was the focus of israel's operations in gaza . mr anderson said neither area had the infrastructure to support the masses seeking shelter . in al-mawasi , "" everything people have access to , we have to truck in . . . which includes food , water , moving solid waste , so it's very much a makeshift camp , "" he said .

"" i am responsible for answering the poignant questions that drive sleep from your eyes , "" he told bereaved families . israel's prime minister , by contrast , has been full of praise for his forces ' sense of responsibility , almost silent on his own . but his focus on fallen heroes does not address the accusations against him : that it was on his watch that hamas grew strong enough to launch last october's attack ; on his watch that israel's intelligence failed - and that his choice to continue the conflict now is rooted in his own political survival . benjamin netanyahu is facing a military war in gaza , and a growing political war at home .",iran crash : what next for iran after president ebrahim raisi's death

"" people face constant exhaustion , hunger and fear , "" warned the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa . israel's military says it is continuing "" operations against terror targets "" in the east of the city , where more than a million people had been sheltering . new israeli operations in northern gaza have displaced another 100,000 people . israeli troops have gone back into the areas of zeitoun and jabalia , where the military says hamas has regrouped only five months after it claimed to have dismantled the group's local battalions . the military ordered civilians to evacuate eastern rafah and jabalia for their own safety before starting the assaults , but the total of those displaced in recent days is equivalent to almost a quarter of gaza's 2.3 million population . israel launched a military campaign to destroy hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern israel on 7 october , during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage . more than 35,170 people have been killed in gaza since then , including 82 in the past 24 hours , according to the territory's hamas-run health ministry . on tuesday morning , unrwa posted several photos showing empty streets in rafah which were packed with tents and makeshift shelters before the start of the israeli operation on 6 may . families had fled in search of safety , it said , but added : "" nowhere is safe . an immediate ceasefire is the only hope . "" unrwa spokeswoman louise wateridge , who is in rafah , wrote on x ( formerly twitter ) that families still in the city had "" moved as far west as possible "" and had set up tents on beaches along the mediterranean coast . further inland was "" now a ghost town "" , she added . hadeel radwan , a displaced mother of a newborn baby who is sheltering in the western tal al-sultan area , said she was terrified by the constant shelling and was enduring shortages of drinking water and other supplies . she told afp news agency that fellow residents had been fleeing , but "" i had a c-section and moving quickly , under threat , would be difficult for me .

"" they are in the streets inside the built-up area and there are clashes , "" they added . al-jneineh was one of the eastern neighbourhoods covered by the initial israeli evacuation order , while brazil was included in the expanded evacuation zone declared on saturday . residents have been told to head towards an "" expanded humanitarian area "" , which stretches north from the coastal strip of al-mawasi to the central town of deir al-balah . but the un has said the area lacks basic infrastructure . in a statement issued on tuesday , the israel defense forces said troops had "" eliminated several armed terrorist cells in close-quarters encounters on the gazan side of the rafah crossing "" and also "" eliminated a number of terrorists and located weapons "" in eastern areas of rafah . hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by israel , the uk and other countries - said its fighters had killed and wounded several israeli troops after it targeted an israeli troop carrier with an anti-tank missile in the al-salam neighbourhood , south of brazil , and blew up a booby-trapped building on george street , which runs through al-jneineh . the idf said a soldier was seriously wounded in combat in southern gaza . after seven months of war in gaza , israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking rafah and eliminating the last remaining hamas battalions . but the un and western powers have warned that an all-out assault could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe . as well as the mass displacement of palestinians in the city , the un has warned that it is running out of supplies of fuel , food and other essential goods because the rafah crossing is closed and the nearby kerem shalom crossing with israel is inaccessible due to the hostilities in the area . the un said an indian staff member was killed on monday in a strike as he travelled in a marked vehicle to the european gaza hospital in khan younis , just to the north-east of rafah , without blaming any party . the idf said an initial inquiry indicated the vehicle was struck in an active combat zone and that it had not been made aware of its route . but the un said israeli authorities had been informed of its planned movements . white house national security adviser jake sullivan said on monday that the us still believed "" it would be a mistake to launch a major military operation into the heart of rafah that would put huge numbers of civilians at risk without a clear strategic gain "" . "" we are still working with israel on a better way to ensure the defeat of hamas everywhere in gaza , including in rafah , "" he added . qatar's prime minister meanwhile warned on tuesday that the rafah operation had "" sent backward "" his country and egypt's efforts to broker a new ceasefire and hostage release deal between israel and hamas . "" especially in the past few weeks , we have seen some momentum building but unfortunately , things didn't move in the right direction and right now we are in a status of almost a stalemate , "" sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al-thani told an economic forum in doha . the idf also said on tuesday that its forces had engaged in a number of battles in the jabalia area of northern gaza , adding that they had "" eliminated by tank fire dozens of terrorists who shot at the troops and dismantled an explosives network that was planted in the area "" . troops also "" eliminated several terrorists "" , located tunnel shafts , and dismantled launches and a weapons storage facility in the zeitoun area , in eastern gaza city , according to the statement . hamas's military wing said its fighters had fired missiles at tanks inside jabalia's refugee camp and also targeted troops inside a house with missiles and explosive devices , killing or wounding a number of them . the idf said three soldiers were seriously wounded in northern gaza . residents who fled jabalia on monday said they had seen tanks pushing into the camp under cover from heavy fire from the air and ground . one man still living inside jabalia with his wife and several young children told bbc arabic's gaza lifeline programme that it was "" as if we had returned to the first days of the war "" .

2024-05-14T11:46:08.000Z,BBC,"reporters always carry some kind of baggage with them when they head off to cover a story - whether it's the tools of their trade , a camera or a microphone , or something less tangible , such as memories of a past encounter or story . it was on a recent deployment that the bbc's middle east analyst sebastian usher suddenly noticed that the often unwanted companion that seemingly always accompanied him on trips abroad had suddenly gone missing . i got back from a reporting trip to jerusalem , with all the usual highs and lows , and with the backdrop of one of the world's most utterly enthralling cities . and i realised on my return that something that habitually accompanies me on such trips had been missing . something that i have always somewhat resented , yet also jealously guarded as an essential part of who i am . my stutter . even after all these years it is almost always there , just giving a little wave as i prepare to do the umpteenth live interview . it's mostly very well-behaved these days and surprisingly flexible , even generous . at one time , it would let me know that a certain word - say , "" syria "" - was a no-go . that was fair and mostly allowed me a way around it . it had no objections , for instance , to "" syrian territory "" or the "" syrian region "" . having to find fresh phrases can be an asset for a reporter . so it was perfectly liveable-with and to be honest - after a lifetime of listening to that little voice - quite companionable . but high up on the windswept bureau balcony in jerusalem , the voice was silent . there have been times like this before , and it has always returned . but who knows - this time it might be for good . and it makes me feel a little bereft . when i look back , i can't really remember how it started but i do know that it was - to me at least - a relatively unobtrusive part of my childhood . i was lucky to have a relatively sheltered , privileged upbringing where if it was noted at all , it was seen as a vaguely charming mark of distinction . a musty old classics teacher would tell me about the great athenian rhetorician demosthenes standing on the beach with stones in his mouth to cure his stutter . it didn't really appeal . any time there was some distance that needed to be bridged - like speaking on a phone or asking for a bus ticket - it could be a problem . anything too formal , too . and i found early on that it was really a stammer , not a stutter . words didn't fracture and become staccato . they simply sat in the path like great unblinking toads , slyly preventing anything from getting past . but a stutter always sounded classier to me , so i've stuck with that . it's been everywhere with me - at school , university , work . it's been quite remarkably even-handed in showing up in formal or casual situations . and utterly capricious , suddenly coming up with an entirely new syllable or consonant to place out of bounds . people would ask : is it nerves ? are you very anxious ? which would of course give me anxiety - so i never mentioned it . this meant that if suddenly , halfway through a sentence , i was struck dumb , people would react as if it were some biblical curse . once in jordan after a 12-hour bus journey through the endless scrubland from riyadh , i was suddenly unable to sound out a single word , a great imaginary boulder having materialised on my tongue through the night . across the middle east , beyond the endless strife and complication , certain things were at least clear to me - "" lebanon "" was no problem , "" iraq "" and "" iran "" were easy - "" israel "" too - "" egypt "" a doddle - but "" tunisia "" , "" tel aviv "" and "" turkey "" were temperamental , withdrawing access at a moment's notice . i would try to avoid listening to a fellow correspondent on the same story before going on air , in case my inner voice should triumphantly extricate the key word from their report and place it in quarantine . that voice has however become ever more forgiving and forbearing down the years ; now it is mostly a whisper of itself . but it's never gone away - or so i thought . maybe i was just holding onto it as a precious fragment of a long-lost self - a sense that there was always something latent and untapped that lay beyond the surface . a connection - semi secret - to entire worlds of people that were gone . as she sank ever deeper into alzheimer's , my mother , who had helped make it so that i never felt it a burden or a hindrance , simply denied outright that my stutter had ever existed - a last link broken with the past . perhaps it's her gentleness and elegant humour that the trace of sudden silence on my tongue still keeps alive . or did . so , the next time i am lost for words , it may simply be because there are none left to convey what is happening in gaza , israel and beyond .",uk floods hit vegetable supply with carrots imported from israel

"" the world places the responsibility for the humanitarian situation on israel , but the key to preventing a humanitarian crisis in gaza is now in the hands of our egyptian friends , "" mr katz wrote on x . egypt's foreign minister sameh shoukry quickly responded to the comments with a statement that underlined its "" categorical rejection of the policy of distorting facts and disavowing responsibility adopted by israel "" . mr shoukry asserted that israel was "" solely responsible for the humanitarian catastrophe currently endured by palestinians in gaza "" , which he said was "" a direct result of indiscriminate israeli atrocities committed against the palestinians for more than seven month "" . he called on israel to "" assume its legal responsibility as the occupying power by allowing aid access through the land ports that are under its control "" . egypt has been one of the mediators in stalled ceasefire talks , but its relationship with israel has been strained since israel seized the gaza side of the rafah crossing on 7 may . almost 450,000 palestinians have fled from rafah over the past week after the israeli military moved into the area , the un says . israeli tanks are reportedly pushing deeper into rafah city , which is to the north of the border crossing . antónio guterres , un secretary-general , said in a statement that he was "" appalled by the escalation of military activity in and around rafah by the israeli defense forces "" . reiterating calls for a ceasefire and for the rafah crossing to be opened , he continued : "" these developments are further impeding humanitarian access and worsening an already dire situation .

"" from the initial investigation . . . it appears that the tank fighters , from the ultra-orthodox paratrooper company hetz , identified a gun barrel coming out of one of the windows in the building , and directed each other to shoot at the building , "" it said . seven other soldiers were wounded by the tank fire , three of them seriously . the deaths increased to 278 the number of israeli soldiers killed since the start of the ground offensive in gaza on 27 october . another 348 troops were among the 1,200 people killed in hamas's unprecedented cross-border attack on southern israel on 7 october , which triggered the war . some were also taken back to gaza as hostages . more than 35,270 people have been killed in gaza since then , according to the territory's hamas-run health ministry . according to the idf's website , 44 of the soldiers killed in gaza as of wednesday - 15 % of the total - died as a result of what it describes as "" operational accidents "" . twenty-two of them were killed by "" friendly fire "" , five died because of "" firing irregularities "" , and 17 as a result of "" accidents "" , including incidents involving weaponry and trampling . on thursday afternoon , official palestinian news agency wafa reported that four people , including a pregnant woman , had been killed in an israeli air strike on a house in the al-faluja area of jabalia camp . earlier , it said there had been intense strikes in the al-hoja street area , causing its "" complete destruction "" . hamas's military wing claimed on thursday that it had fired an anti-tank missile at an israeli troop carrier in the block 2 area of jabalia camp and targeted armoured bulldozers with explosive devices east of jabalia town . the idf's chief of staff , lt gen herzi halevi , told troops in gaza on tuesday that israeli forces were "" striking widely and strongly "" in jabalia . "" we see there attempts [ by hamas ] to hold on and rebuild , therefore we need to deal with this again and prove that we will return each time , "" he added . wafa also cited medical sources as saying that more than 30 civilians , including 10 children , had been killed in israeli air strikes on residential buildings in nearby gaza city . palestine post photojournalist mahmoud jahjouh and several members of his family were reportedly among the dead . the idf scaled down operations in jabalia , gaza city and the rest of the north in january after declaring that it had "" dismantled "" hamas's battalions there . but that left a power vacuum in which the group has been able to rebuild . an estimated 300,000 people trapped in the devastated region are also experiencing a "" full-blown famine "" due to a lack of aid deliveries , according to the head of the world food programme . the us announced on thursday that it had managed to anchor a floating pier in gaza as part of efforts to boost levels of humanitarian assistance . but the state department said the situation in gaza was continuing to deteriorate and urged israel to do more to provide sustained aid access to both southern and northern gaza . spokesman vedant patel said the flow of fuel aid into the territory through the rafah crossing from egypt had come "" to a complete halt "" . these comments were echoed by the un's aid chief , who told the reuters news agency that the humanitarian operation was "" stuck "" . "" stocks of food which were in place already in southern gaza are running out . i think we're talking about almost none left , "" said martin griffiths . meanwhile , in the south of gaza on thursday , fresh israeli air strikes killed at least five people in southern and central rafah , wafa reported . the idf has ordered the evacuation of a number of neighbourhoods since 6 may , when it began what it called "" precise operations "" against hamas in "" specific areas of eastern rafah and the gazan side of the rafah crossing "" . israel says it needs to send troops into the city because hamas's last remaining battalions are based there . but the un and western powers say an all-out assault could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe . israel's defence minister said on thursday that the rafah operation would continue "" as additional forces will enter "" . "" tunnels have already been destroyed by our forces and more tunnels will be destroyed soon . this activity will intensify , "" he added . "" we are wearing hamas down .

2024-05-16T16:43:33.000Z,BBC,"the united nations has revised down the figure it publishes for the proportion of women and children killed in gaza , leading to claims fewer palestinians have been killed since israel launched its offensive following the hamas attack of 7 october . on 6 may , the un said that 69 % of reported fatalities were women and children . two days later , it said this figure was 52 % . the overall number of reported deaths in gaza - which currently stands at more than 35,000 - has not changed , but the un now says incomplete information has led to the revision . the un says it is now relying on figures from the hamas-run health ministry in gaza , rather than from the hamas-run government media office ( gmo ) . the israeli foreign minister highlighted the un's change , calling the lower reported death tolls for women and children "" the miraculous resurrection of the dead in gaza "" and accusing the un of relying on "" fake data from a terrorist organisation "" . the figures have been released in different ways by the two separate authorities - the gmo and the health ministry - and the un has now switched from quoting the former to the latter to break down demographic data . at the start of the war the health ministry only reported deaths for which details had been registered in hospitals , whereas from november , the gmo included an additional category of deaths recorded in "" reliable media reports "" . more recently the health ministry has included these media reports compiled by the gmo , along with an additional category of deaths recorded by family members by filling in an online form . gaza's health ministry is now therefore reporting these figures : some of these for which information is missing ( such as an id number or date of birth ) are included in the overall number of deaths in the health ministry figures , but are not broken down demographically . the number of women and children killed is deeply contested because it is often interpreted as an indication of the number of civilian deaths . in a recent interview , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said about 30,000 people had been killed in gaza , with 14,000 of them being "" terrorists "" and 16,000 civilians . he did not provide any evidence for those figures . keeping precise records of casualties during wartime is challenging , so it is therefore not unusual for the numbers reported to vary , according to prof erica charters who specialises in the study of war . the initial figure for how many people were killed in hamas's 7 october attacks was originally put at 1,400 by israeli authorities , but was later revised down to about 1,200 . at the time , the israeli authorities said the misidentification of some of the burnt bodies was the reason for the discrepancy . the gmo has consistently given a higher figure for the proportion of women and children in all fatalities than has the health ministry . on 6 may , the un reported 34,735 deaths - of which there were 9,500 women and 14,500 children , citing the gmo as its source . the two days later , the un released a further report , switching its sourcing to the health ministry . the result of this was that although the overall recorded death toll was almost unchanged ( 34,844 ) , the number of registered deaths of women ( 4.959 ) and children ( 7,797 ) had both fallen significantly . this difference was because those individuals with incomplete information were not included in the demographic breakdown . the gmo says the proportion of women and children killed in the conflict is around 70 % . the un's latest report , citing health ministry data , says out of 24,686 fully identified fatalities , 52 % were women and children , 40 % were men , and 8 % were "" elderly "" , without specifying whether they were male or female . it isn't clear what age the report considers to be "" elderly "" and how it categorises children . we have done our own analysis of detailed data released by the health ministry , and also found that 52 % of the fatalities were listed as women and children ( anyone under 18 ) . in addition , 43 % were men and another 5 % were "" unknown "" ( missing information such as an age or gender ) . for the gmo's figure to be compatible with the health ministry's data , almost all of the 10,000 deaths not fully identified by the ministry would have to have been women and children . "" it's not logically impossible . . . but it really strains credibility , "" says prof michael spagat , who specialises in examining death tolls in conflicts around the world . we asked the gmo why the proportion of women and children they have recorded as killed is so much higher than in the health ministry's data , but they did not provide a direct response to the discrepancy . we also approached the health ministry for comment . prof spagat also told the bbc that the death toll in gaza was "" staggeringly high "" given the war has only been going on for six months , noting that the verified hospital deaths still represent about 1 % of gaza's pre-war population of 2.4 million . asked by bbc verify why it made the change , the un said it used the gmo data for women and children killed because the health ministry had not been publishing these figures . "" once the ministry of health in gaza published breakdowns that were more comprehensive , backed up by a list of names , the un reports reflected that data instead , "" a un spokesman said . he added that in both cases , the figures were attributed to their source and a "" clear note "" was added making clear the un's "" inability to presently provide an independent confirmation of the data "" . the un has previously said that it has a "" long-standing co-operation "" with the gaza health ministry , and that its previous reporting has been considered credible and "" well developed "" . data analysis by rob england and daniel wainwright what do you want bbc verify to investigate ?",joe biden warns of ' ferocious surge ' of antisemitism in us

2024-05-16T18:30:03.397Z,BBC,"the un's top court is hearing israel's response to a case brought by south africa seeking an emergency halt to its offensive in rafah . south africa has also accused israel of genocide in the gaza war.israel , which has called south africa's case "" wholly unfounded "" and "" morally repugnant "" , responded on friday accusing south africa of bringing "" biased and false claims "" . the words of the international court of justice ( icj ) have been subject to intense scrutiny since south africa brought its case and it’s centred around the use of the word “ plausible ” in the ruling.in january , the icj delivered an interim judgement - and one key paragraph from the ruling drew the most attention : “ in the court’s view , the facts and circumstances . . . are sufficient to conclude that at least some of the rights claimed by south africa and for which it is seeking protection are plausible . ” this was interpreted by many , including some legal commentators , to mean that the court had concluded that the claim that israel was committing genocide in gaza was “ plausible ” . this interpretation spread quickly , appearing in un press releases , statements from campaign groups and many media outlets , including the bbc.in april , however , joan donoghue , the president of the icj at the time of that ruling , said in a bbc interview that this was not what the court had ruled.rather , she said , the purpose of the ruling was to declare that south africa had a right to bring its case against israel and that palestinians had “ plausible rights to protection from genocide ” - rights which were at a real risk of irreparable damage . the judges had stressed they did not need to say for now whether a genocide had occurred but concluded that some of the acts south africa complained about , if they were proven , could fall under the united nations ’ convention on genocide.let’s look at the background of the case and how the legal dispute unfolded.the icj was set up to deal with disputes between the nations of the world relating to international law.that means laws that are agreed between nations , such as the genocide convention , a key measure agreed after world war two to try to prevent such mass slaughter again.last december , south africa launched an attempt at the icj to prove that , in its view , israel was committing genocide in relation to how it was perpetrating the war against hamas in the gaza strip.it alleged that the way israel had prosecuted the war was “ genocidal in nature ” because , according to the south african case , there was an intention to “ destroy palestinians in gaza ” . israel absolutely rejected these allegations , saying the entire case misrepresented what was happening on the ground.south africa would need to show the court clear and hard evidence of an alleged plan to commit genocide . israel , for its part , would have a right to examine those claims one by one and argue that its actions , in a dreadful urban war , were legitimate self-defence against hamas , which is designated as a terrorist group by dozens of countries . that full case could take years to prepare and argue.so south africa asked the icj judges to first issue “ provisional measures ” . that’s the icj’s term for a court injunction - an order from a judge to freeze a situation , to prevent any harm being done , before a final court finding can be reached . the court was asked to order israel to take steps to “ protect against further , severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the palestinian people ” . over two days lawyers for both countries argued over whether palestinians in gaza had rights that the court needs to protect.the ruling , to which 17 judges contributed ( with some of them disagreeing ) , came on 26 january . “ at this stage of the proceedings , the court is not called upon to determine definitively whether the rights which south africa wishes to see protected exist , ” said the icj . “ it need only decide whether the rights claimed by south africa , and for which it is seeking protection , are plausible . “ in the court’s view , the facts and circumstances . . . are sufficient to conclude that at least some of the rights claimed by south africa and for which it is seeking protection are plausible . ” having decided that palestinians in gaza had plausible rights under the genocide convention , it concluded that they were at real risk of irreparable damage - and israel should take steps to prevent genocide from occurring while these critical issues remain in question.the court did not rule whether israel had committed genocide - but did its wording mean that it was convinced there was a risk of that happening ? this is where the dispute over what the court actually meant then took off.in april , some 600 british lawyers including four former supreme court justices , signed a letter to the uk prime minister , asking him to stop arms sales to israel and referring to “ a plausible risk of genocide ” . that triggered a counter-letter from uk lawyers for israel ( uklfi ) . the 1,300-strong group said the icj had only ruled that gaza palestinians had a plausible right to be protected from genocide - in other words , that it had been dealing with a complex and somewhat abstract legal argument.the dispute continued in more letters and interpretations.many in the first group described uklfi’s interpretation as “ empty wordplay ” . the court , they argued , cannot have been solely concerned with an academic question - because the stakes were far higher than that.and , of all places , the debate crystallised in legal sparring before a uk parliamentary committee , debating the question of arms exports to israel.lord sumption , a former uk supreme court justice , told the committee : “ i think it is being suggested [ in the uklfi letter ] that all that the icj was doing was accepting , as a matter of abstract law , that the inhabitants of gaza had a right not to be subjected to genocide . i have to say that i regard that proposition as barely arguable . ” not so , responded natasha hausdorff of uk lawyers for israel . “ i respectfully insist that reading a finding of plausible risk that israel is committing genocide disregards the court’s unambiguous statements , ” she replied.a day later , joan donoghue - now retired from the icj - appeared on the bbc’s hardtalk programme and explicitly tried to end the debate by setting out what the court had done . “ it did not decide - and this is something where i'm correcting what's often said in the media . . . that the claim of genocide was plausible , ” said the judge . “ it did emphasise in the order that there was a risk of irreparable harm to the palestinian right to be protected from genocide . but the shorthand that often appears , which is that there's a plausible case of genocide , isn't what the court decided . ” whether there is any evidence of such terrible harm is a question the court is far from deciding .",gaza protests : oxford and cambridge university students set up camps

"" there are no repercussions . they [ israeli soldiers ] get encouraged and supported by the highest ministers of the government , "" he said . and he says this plays into a mindset that the military already subscribes to . "" the culture in the military , when it comes to palestinians , is that they are only targets . they are not human beings . this is how the military teaches you to behave . "" israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 jews since it occupied the west bank and east jerusalem - land the palestinians want as part of a future state - in the 1967 middle east war . the majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law , although israel disputes this . our analysis found that the 45 social media videos and photos that we examined were posted by 11 soldiers of the kfir brigade , which is the largest infantry brigade in the idf and mainly operates in the west bank . all 11 are , or were , serving soldiers , and did not hide their identity on social media . four are from a kfir brigade reservist battalion - the 9213 - whose area of operation appears to be in the northern part of the west bank , according to our analysis of their social media videos . we asked the idf about the actions of the individual soldiers we have named and whether they have been disciplined , but they did not respond . we also attempted to contact these soldiers on their public social media accounts to put our findings to them . one appears to have blocked us and the others did not reply at the time of writing . the most prolific of these soldiers posts under the name yohai vazana . many of his videos show his battalion entering homes at night and detaining palestinians - often binding their hands and blindfolding them . women are seen panicking as they are filmed without their headscarves . mr vazana - a self-proclaimed "" digital creator "" whose forearms bear tattoos saying "" never forget never forgive , 7/10 "" - often refers to his operations as "" hunts "" . his military insignia , visible in the videos , suggests he carries the rank of sergeant major . he has posted 22 videos and photos on facebook and tiktok , from what appear to be bodycam footage of patrols , showing the detention of palestinians . tiktok confirmed that two videos we highlighted , which had not been taken down on its platform , have now been removed for violating its guidelines which "" make clear that we do not tolerate content that seeks to degrade victims of violent tragedies "" . meta , the company that owns facebook , explained that it is reviewing the content and will remove any videos that violate its policies . this photo , a screenshot from one of yohai vazana's videos , shows members of his battalion forcefully entering a home and posing in front of a palestinian woman with a child . fellow soldier ofer bobrov features in a number of shots with mr vazana . captions on his videos often include the hashtag "" 9213 "" , suggesting he is from mr vazana's battalion . mr bobrov's videos of his military operations are posted alongside clips of soldiers dancing and partying , getting ready for patrols , and other snippets from their everyday life . one video posted on 12 february on tiktok includes several photos of a detainee blindfolded and bound on the floor as a soldier poses with the israeli flag behind him . another soldier from the same battalion , who goes by sammy ben online , has posted eight videos and one photo of palestinian detainees on instagram . the detained palestinians are frequently shown blindfolded and restrained , having been forced to either lie on the floor , or squat , with their hands bound behind their backs , in what are often referred to by military and law enforcement as "" stress positions "" . mr ben says in the posts that he and his fellow soldiers have detained "" terrorists "" and claim to have found hamas flags on them . israel - like the uk , us and other countries - proscribes hamas as a terrorist organisation . in one video , mr ben , who has also served with idf forces in gaza , mocks two detained palestinians , ordering them to say : "" am yisrael chai "" , meaning "" the people of israel live "" . ori dahbash is another member of the same battalion who has posted footage of military operations in the west bank , including a photo of a detainee that has also been shared by mr vazana . experts said the footage posted by the soldiers could violate international law . dr mark ellis , executive director of the international bar association , called for an investigation into the incidents in the footage , and for the idf to discipline the soldiers involved . international human rights lawyer sir geoffrey nice , who worked with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia ( icty ) between 1998 and 2006 , agreed with dr ellis , but was sceptical anyone would be held to account for their actions . in response to our investigation , the idf replied : "" the idf holds its soldiers to a professional standard … and investigates when behavior is not in line with the idf's values . in the event of unacceptable behavior , soldiers were disciplined and even suspended from reserve duty .

"" the officer opened fire five times , hitting the individual four times , "" said rouen public prosecutor frédéric teillet , explaining that he had seen the footage on the security cameras.firefighters at the scene eventually brought the fire under control inside the synagogue in the historic centre of the city . there appeared to be no victims other than the armed man , the mayor said.damage inside the synagogue has been described as significant . "" i'm really upset , it's catastrophic , "" said natacha benhaïm , the head of rouen's jewish community of some 150 families.the walls and furniture had been left blackened by the fire , although "" the torah scrolls , the holy books , did not come to any harm "" . inspecting the damage inside the synagogue , rabbi shmouel lubecki said the city's small community was devastated by the attack .

"" so we're asking the community to light the candles this sabbath evening and come to the synagogue if you can . "" mr teillet said two investigations were under way - into an arson attack on a place of worship and into the use of a police weapon outside the building.although the officer was currently in custody , the prosecutor said that video footage indicated he had used his gun "" according to conditions allowed by the internal security code "" . interior minister gérald darmanin visited the synagogue and praised police for their fast response and their courage in tackling the attacker . "" i want to reiterate , on this sabbath evening , that at the interior ministry we are extremely determined to protect france's entire jewish community , wherever they are , and that they must practise their religion without fear . "" little is known about the suspected attacker , who was not carrying any form of identity at the time . french media report that he was a 29-year-old algerian who was in the process of appealing against an expulsion order from french authorities.france , in common with the rest of western europe , has seen a surge in antisemitism since hamas attacked southern israel last october leading to the current war in gaza.earlier this week a memorial in paris that honours 3,900 men and women who helped rescue jews during the nazi occupation of france in world war two was daubed with red-painted hands.president emmanuel macron said defacing the wall undermined the memory of france's heroes and its victims of the holocaust.france has the third largest jewish community in the world , after israel and the us . the head of france's council of jewish institutions ( crif ) , yonathan arfi , said that "" setting a synagogue on fire - that's intending to intimidate every jew "" . another leading figure in the jewish community , elie korchia , thanked police for their quick response to "" a new antisemitic drama in our country "" . the president of rouen's union of muslims , imam bachar el sayidi , visited the synagogue on friday in a message of solidarity : "" we firmly condemn what has happened . if a mosque was attacked it would be no different .

"" football should not and should never become a hostage for politics and always remain a vector for peace , a source of hope , a force of good , uniting people rather than dividing , "" infantino said . "" this legal assessment will have to allow for inputs and claims of both member associations . the results of this analysis and the recommendations which will follow from this analysis will subsequently be forwarded to the fifa council . "" infantino has played down the prospect of legal threats over plans for a 32-team men's club world cup next summer.the world governing body faces a legal threat from players ' union fifpro and the world leagues association if it continues with plans to host the tournament.earlier this month , fifpro and the wla said the global football calendar is "" beyond saturation "" and that "" players are being pushed beyond their limits "" . speaking at fifa's 74th congress infantino said he hoped fifpro and the wla should stop this "" futile debate "" . "" even with the new club world cup of fifa with 32 teams and 63 matches every four years , fifa is organising around 1 % of the games of the top clubs in the world , "" he said . "" all other matches , 98 , 99 % , are organised by the different leagues , associations , confederations , by all of you , - and that's good .

"" it was rafah that brought south africa to the court . but it is all palestinians as a national , ethnical and racial group who need the protection from genocide that the court can order , "" he said.but , delivering israel's response , its deputy attorney general , gilad noam , said that was an inversion of reality . "" south africa warns this court that , i quote , ' if rafah falls , so too does gaza ' . once again however , the reality is exactly the opposite , "" he said .

"" if you put the national over personal , you will find in us partners in the struggle , "" he said . "" but if you choose the path of fanatics and lead the entire nation to the abyss , we will be forced to quit the government . "" mr netanyahu dismissed the comments as "" washed-up words "" that would mean "" defeat for israel "" . the growing rift comes as fighting rages at both ends of the gaza strip , with israeli forces operating in the southern city of rafah and the northern town of jabalia , one of gaza’s historic refugee camps and an area the israeli military previously said it had cleared of hamas fighters.mr gantz was speaking just days after another war cabinet member , defence minister yoav gallant , urged mr netanyahu to state publicly that israel had no plans to take over civilian and military rule in gaza.mr gallant said he had raised the issue repeatedly for months but had received no response.he and mr gantz say that maintaining military control in gaza would increase israel's security risks , while others , including far-right members of mr netanyahu's ruling coalition in the government , believe continued control is necessary in order to defeat hamas . in a televised address on saturday , mr gantz told mr netanyahu that the "" people of israel are watching you "" . "" you must choose between zionism and cynicism , between unity and factions , between responsibility and lawlessness , between victory and disaster , "" he said . also among the six strategic goals he set out were the return of all israeli and foreign hostages still held by hamas in gaza and the return of displaced palestinian civilians to northern gaza by 1 september . he also said israel should continue to seek the normalisation of relations with saudi arabia as part of a "" comprehensive process to create an alliance with the free world and the west against iran and its allies "" . responding to the speech , mr netanyahu said that to meet mr gantz's demands would lead to "" the end of the war and a defeat for israel , the abandoning of most of the hostages , leaving hamas intact and the establishment of a palestinian state "" . israel's war cabinet was established after hamas attacked israeli communities near gaza on 7 october , killing around 1,200 people and taking hostages.israel's military campaign against hamas in gaza has killed 35,386 people , the hamas-run health ministry says . the chief of staff of the country’s army , herzi halevi , has also privately pressed on mr netanyahu the need for a “ day after ” strategy , according to reports in israeli media.the return of the israeli military to parts of northern gaza , like jabalia , that were previously declared clear of hamas has raised doubts about the government’s strategy for eliminating the group.mr halevi is said to have argued that , in the absence of a diplomatic process to establish a governing body other than hamas , the military will be forced to launch repeated campaigns to keep the group at bay.mr gantz proposed an american , european , arab , and palestinian administration that could manage civilian affairs in gaza while the foundations are laid for a future alternative government . he added that israel could maintain a degree of "" security control "" in the meantime . in jabalia the israeli defense forces ( idf ) said they fought battles with palestinian armed groups . palestinian medics said one of the israeli strikes had killed 15 people.hamas said israel's "" brutal raids "" on jabalia had killed dozens of civilians and wounded hundreds more.late on saturday israel also issued new evacuation orders for parts of northern gaza , saying armed groups had fired rockets towards its territory.last week , israel began operations in the southern city of rafah - to which civilians from elsewhere in gaza had previously been told to evacuate - saying it needed to enter the city in order to target hamas's last remaining strongholds.on saturday , it launched air strikes and raids on targets in the east of the city . philippe lazzarini , the head of united nations relief and works agency ( unrwa ) , said some 800,000 palestinians had now left rafah , seeking shelter in the shattered city of khan younis or along the coast . "" since the war in gaza began , palestinians have been forced to flee multiple times in search of safety that they have never found , "" he said .

2024-05-20T08:37:16.576Z,BBC,"ebrahim raisi stood close to the pinnacle of power in the islamic republic and was widely tipped to rise to its very top.a dramatic turn dealt him a different hand.his death in a helicopter crash on sunday has upended the growing speculation over who will eventually replace the 85-year-old supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , whose own health has long been the focus of intense interest.the tragic fate of iran’s hardline president is not expected to disrupt the direction of iranian policy or jolt the islamic republic in any consequential way.but it will test a system where conservative hardliners now dominate all branches of power , both elected and unelected . “ the system will make a massive show of his death and stick to constitutional procedures to show functionality , while it seeks a new recruit who can maintain conservative unity and loyalty to khamenei , ” observes dr sanam vakil , director of the middle east and north africa programme at the chatham house think tank.raisi's opponents will hail the exit of a former prosecutor accused of a decisive role in the mass execution of political prisoners in the 1980s which he denied ; they will hope the end of his rule hastens the end of this regime.for iran’s ruling conservatives , the state funeral will be an occasion freighted with emotion ; it will also be an opportunity to start sending their signals of continuity.they know the world is watching . “ for 40 some years , in western narratives , iran was supposed to collapse and fall apart , "" professor mohammed marandi of tehran university told the bbc . "" but somehow , miraculously , it's still here and i predict it will still be here in years to come . ” another critical position which must be filled is the seat held by this middle-ranking cleric on the assembly of experts , the body empowered to choose the new supreme leader , when that far more consequential transition comes . “ raisi was a potential successor because , like khamenei himself when he became supreme leader , he was relatively young , very loyal , an ideologue committed to the system who has name recognition , ” says dr vakil of this opaque process of selection , where a number of names are seen to be in the running including the supreme leader’s son mojtaba khamenei.even before raisi’s death was officially confirmed , the ayatollah conveyed in a post on x that “ the iranian people should not worry , there will be no disruption in the country’s affairs . ” the more immediate political challenge will be staging early presidential elections . power has been transferred to vice-president mohammad mokhber ; new elections must be held within 50 days.this appeal to voters will come just months after march’s parliamentary elections revealed a record low turnout in a country which once prided itself on strong enthusiastic participation in this exercise . recent elections , including the contest in 2021 which brought raisi to the presidency , were also marked by the systematic exclusion of moderate and pro-reform rivals by the oversight body . “ early presidential elections could provide khamenei and the upper echelons of the state with an opportunity to reverse that trajectory to give voters a way back into the political process , ” says mohammad ali shabani , editor of london-based news website amwaj.media . “ but , unfortunately , so far we have seen no indications of the state being ready and willing to take such a step . ” but , even within raisi’s ranks , there appears to be no obvious successor . “ there are different camps within this conservative group , including individuals who are more hardline and others regarded as more pragmatic , ” points out hamidreza azizi , a visiting fellow at swp , the berlin-based think tank . he believes this will intensify the current jockeying for position within the new parliament and at local levels.whoever assumes raisi’s mantle inherits a forbidding agenda and limited levers of power.ultimate decision-making authority in the islamic republic lies with the supreme leader . foreign policy , especially in the region , is the preserve of the islamic revolution guard corps ( irgc ) who wield growing power.the president didn’t call the shots months ago when iran confronted unprecedented tensions with its arch-enemy israel over the devastating israel gaza war . it triggered a dangerous tit-for-tat and set alarm bells ringing in many capitals , most of all tehran , over the potential for an even riskier escalatory spiral.but as he presided over day-to-day business , iranians struggled to cope with deepening financial hardship linked to crippling international sanctions as well as mismanagement and corruption . inflation soared to more than 40 % ; the rial currency plunged in value.on his watch , the islamic republic was also shaken by an extraordinary wave of protests sparked by the death in custody in september 2022 of 22-year-old mahsa amini who was detained by morality police for allegedly violating iran’s strict dress code.weeks before the unrest , raisi had ordered a tightening of iran’s “ hijab and chastity law ” which obligated women to behave and dress modestly including wearing a headscarf . but the protests spearheaded by a young generation of women , lashing out against a raft of restrictions imposed on their lives , mainly focused their fury on the real sources of power , the supreme leader and the system itself . human rights groups say hundreds were killed in the crackdown and thousands detained . “ having been elected with the lowest recorded turnout in presidential elections in iranian history , raisi did not have the popular mandate of his predecessor rouhani , “ says shabani in reference to the reformist leader hassan rouhani whose initial popularity was partly fuelled by the 2015 landmark nuclear deal which fell apart when president trump unilaterally pulled the us out three years later . indirect talks between president biden’s administration and raisi’s team made little progress . “ he avoided much of the ire which was directed at rouhani by opponents of the islamic republic , partly because he was simply seen as less influential and effectual , ” explains shabani . the helicopter crash also took the life of iran’s foreign minister hossein amir-abdollahian who played an active role in trying to present tehran’s case to the world and find ways to ease the punishing impact of sanctions . during the urgent diplomacy around the israel-gaza war , he was the voice on the phone and the face at meetings with iran’s allies , as well as with arab and western foreign ministers anxious to calm and contain tensions . “ he was a useful channel to pass messages , ” commented a senior western diplomatic source . “ but it tended to be quite formulaic since power did not lie in the foreign ministry . ” “ the sudden death of a president is normally a consequential event but , despite being seen as a potential supreme leader , he lacked political support and any clear political vision , ” maintains analyst esfandyar batmanghelidj , ceo of the bourse and bazaar think tank . “ but the political operators who got him elected will adjust and advance without him . ”",columbia university : pro-palestinian protesters refuse to disband

"" during my own visit to kibbutz be’eri and kibbutz kfar aza , as well as to the site of supernova music festival in re’im , i saw the devastating scenes of these attacks and the profound impact of the unconscionable crimes charged in the applications filed today . speaking with survivors , i heard how the love within a family , the deepest bonds between a parent and a child , were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness . these acts demand accountability . "" my office also submits there are reasonable grounds to believe that hostages taken from israel have been kept in inhumane conditions , and that some have been subject to sexual violence , including rape , while being held in captivity . we have reached that conclusion based on medical records , contemporaneous video and documentary evidence , and interviews with victims and survivors . my office also continues to investigate reports of sexual violence committed on 7 october . "" i wish to express my gratitude to the survivors , and the families of victims of the 7 october attacks , for their courage in coming forward to provide their accounts to my office . we remain focused on further deepening our investigations of all crimes committed as part of these attacks and will continue to work with all partners to ensure that justice is delivered . "" i again reiterate my call for the immediate release of all hostages taken from israel and for their safe return to their families . this is a fundamental requirement of international humanitarian law . "" "" benjamin netanyahu , yoav gallant""on the basis of evidence collected and examined by my office , i have reasonable grounds to believe that benjamin netanyahu , the prime minister of israel , and yoav gallant , the minister of defence of israel , bear criminal responsibility for the following war crimes and crimes against humanity committed on the territory of the state of palestine ( in the gaza strip ) from at least 8 october 2023:starvation of civilians as a method of warfare as a war crime contrary to article 8(2 ) ( b ) ( xxv ) of the statute;wilfully causing great suffering , or serious injury to body or health contrary to article 8(2 ) ( a ) ( iii ) , or cruel treatment as a war crime contrary to article 8(2 ) ( c ) ( i ) ; wilful killing contrary to article 8(2 ) ( a ) ( i ) , or murder as a war crime contrary to article 8(2 ) ( c ) ( i ) ; intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population as a war crime contrary to articles 8(2 ) ( b ) ( i ) , or 8(2 ) ( e ) ( i ) ; extermination and/or murder contrary to articles 7(1 ) ( b ) and 7(1 ) ( a ) , including in the context of deaths caused by starvation , as a crime against humanity;persecution as a crime against humanity contrary to article 7(1 ) ( h ) ; other inhumane acts as crimes against humanity contrary to article 7(1 ) ( k ) . "" my office submits that the war crimes alleged in these applications were committed in the context of an international armed conflict between israel and palestine , and a non-international armed conflict between israel and hamas ( together with other palestinian armed groups ) running in parallel . we submit that the crimes against humanity charged were committed as part of a widespread and systematic attack against the palestinian civilian population pursuant to state policy . these crimes , in our assessment , continue to this day . "" my office submits that the evidence we have collected , including interviews with survivors and eyewitnesses , authenticated video , photo and audio material , satellite imagery and statements from the alleged perpetrator group , shows that israel has intentionally and systematically deprived the civilian population in all parts of gaza of objects indispensable to human survival . "" this occurred through the imposition of a total siege over gaza that involved completely closing the three border crossing points , rafah , kerem shalom and erez , from 8 october 2023 for extended periods and then by arbitrarily restricting the transfer of essential supplies – including food and medicine – through the border crossings after they were reopened . the siege also included cutting off cross-border water pipelines from israel to gaza – gazans ’ principal source of clean water – for a prolonged period beginning 9 october 2023 , and cutting off and hindering electricity supplies from at least 8 october 2023 until today . this took place alongside other attacks on civilians , including those queuing for food ; obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian agencies ; and attacks on and killing of aid workers , which forced many agencies to cease or limit their operations in gaza . "" my office submits that these acts were committed as part of a common plan to use starvation as a method of war and other acts of violence against the gazan civilian population as a means to ( i ) eliminate hamas ; ( ii ) secure the return of the hostages which hamas has abducted , and ( iii ) collectively punish the civilian population of gaza , whom they perceived as a threat to israel . "" the effects of the use of starvation as a method of warfare , together with other attacks and collective punishment against the civilian population of gaza are acute , visible and widely known , and have been confirmed by multiple witnesses interviewed by my office , including local and international medical doctors . they include malnutrition , dehydration , profound suffering and an increasing number of deaths among the palestinian population , including babies , other children , and women . "" famine is present in some areas of gaza and is imminent in other areas . as un secretary-general antónio guterres warned more than two months ago , “ 1.1 million people in gaza are facing catastrophic hunger – the highest number of people ever recorded – anywhere , anytime ” as a result of an “ entirely man-made disaster ” . today , my office seeks to charge two of those most responsible , netanyahu and gallant , both as co-perpetrators and as superiors pursuant to articles 25 and 28 of the rome statute . "" israel , like all states , has a right to take action to defend its population . that right , however , does not absolve israel or any state of its obligation to comply with international humanitarian law . notwithstanding any military goals they may have , the means israel chose to achieve them in gaza – namely , intentionally causing death , starvation , great suffering , and serious injury to body or health of the civilian population – are criminal . "" since last year , in ramallah , in cairo , in israel and in rafah , i have consistently emphasised that international humanitarian law demands that israel take urgent action to immediately allow access to humanitarian aid in gaza at scale . i specifically underlined that starvation as a method of war and the denial of humanitarian relief constitute rome statute offences . i could not have been clearer . "" as i also repeatedly underlined in my public statements , those who do not comply with the law should not complain later when my office takes action . that day has come . "" "" in presenting these applications for arrest warrants , my office is acting pursuant to its mandate under the rome statute . on 5 february 2021 , pre-trial chamber i decided that the court can exercise its criminal jurisdiction in the situation in the state of palestine and that the territorial scope of this jurisdiction extends to gaza and the west bank , including east jerusalem . this mandate is ongoing and includes the escalation of hostilities and violence since 7 october 2023 . my office also has jurisdiction over crimes committed by nationals of states parties and by the nationals of non-states parties on the territory of a state party . "" today’s applications are the outcome of an independent and impartial investigation by my office . guided by our obligation to investigate incriminating and exonerating evidence equally , my office has worked painstakingly to separate claims from facts and to soberly present conclusions based on evidence to the pre-trial chamber . "" as an additional safeguard , i have also been grateful for the advice of a panel of experts in international law , an impartial group i convened to support the evidence review and legal analysis in relation to these arrest warrant applications . the panel is composed of experts of immense standing in international humanitarian law and international criminal law , including sir adrian fulford pc , former lord justice of appeal and former international criminal court judge ; baroness helena kennedy kc , president of the international bar association’s human rights institute ; elizabeth wilmshurst cmg kc , former deputy legal adviser at the uk foreign and commonwealth office ; danny friedman kc ; and two of my special advisers – amal clooney and his excellency judge theodor meron cmg . this independent expert analysis has supported and strengthened the applications filed today by my office . i have also been grateful for the contributions of a number of my other special advisers to this review , particularly adama dieng and professor kevin jon heller . "" today we once again underline that international law and the laws of armed conflict apply to all . no foot soldier , no commander , no civilian leader – no one – can act with impunity . nothing can justify wilfully depriving human beings , including so many women and children , the basic necessities required for life . nothing can justify the taking of hostages or the targeting of civilians . "" the independent judges of the international criminal court are the sole arbiters as to whether the necessary standard for the issuance of warrants of arrest has been met . should they grant my applications and issue the requested warrants , i will then work closely with the registrar in all efforts to apprehend the named individuals . i count on all states parties to the rome statute to take these applications and the subsequent judicial decision with the same seriousness they have shown in other situations , meeting their obligations under the statute . i also stand ready to work with non-states parties in our common pursuit of accountability . "" it is critical in this moment that my office and all parts of the court , including its independent judges , are permitted to conduct their work with full independence and impartiality . i insist that all attempts to impede , intimidate or improperly influence the officials of this court must cease immediately . my office will not hesitate to act pursuant to article 70 of the rome statute if such conduct continues . "" i remain deeply concerned about ongoing allegations and emerging evidence of international crimes occurring in israel , gaza and the west bank . our investigation continues . my office is advancing multiple and interconnected additional lines of inquiry , including concerning reports of sexual violence during the 7 october attacks , and in relation to the large-scale bombing that has caused and continues to cause so many civilian deaths , injuries , and suffering in gaza . i encourage those with relevant information to contact my office and to submit information via otp link . "" my office will not hesitate to submit further applications for warrants of arrest if and when we consider that the threshold of a realistic prospect of conviction has been met . i renew my call for all parties in the current conflict to comply with the law now . "" i also wish to emphasise that the principle of complementarity , which is at the heart of the rome statute , will continue to be assessed by my office as we take action in relation to the above-listed alleged crimes and alleged perpetrators and move forward with other lines of inquiry . complementarity , however , requires a deferral to national authorities only when they engage in independent and impartial judicial processes that do not shield suspects and are not a sham . it requires thorough investigations at all levels addressing the policies and actions underlying these applications . "" let us today be clear on one core issue : if we do not demonstrate our willingness to apply the law equally , if it is seen as being applied selectively , we will be creating the conditions for its collapse . in doing so , we will be loosening the remaining bonds that hold us together , the stabilising connections between all communities and individuals , the safety net to which all victims look in times of suffering . this is the true risk we face in this moment . "" now , more than ever , we must collectively demonstrate that international humanitarian law , the foundational baseline for human conduct during conflict , applies to all individuals and applies equally across the situations addressed by my office and the court . this is how we will prove , tangibly , that the lives of all human beings have equal value .

2024-05-20T23:30:20.508Z,BBC,"benjamin netanyahu responded with fury to the news that he might face an arrest warrant for war crimes and crimes against humanity . it was "" a moral outrage of historic proportions "" , he said . israel was "" waging a just war against hamas , a genocidal terrorist organisation that perpetrated the worst attack on the jewish people since the holocaust . "" in a bitter personal attack , mr netanyahu said karim khan , the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court ( icc ) was one of the "" great antisemites in modern times . "" mr khan , he said , was like judges in nazi germany who denied jews basic rights and enabled the holocaust . his decision to seek arrest warrants against israel’s prime minister and defence minister was "" callously pouring gasoline on the fires of antisemitism that are raging around the world . ’ mr netanyahu spoke english on the video that was released by his office . he does that when he wants his message to reach the foreign audience that matters most to him , in the us . reacting to the news , israeli defence minister , yoav gallant on tuesday described the arrest warrants against him and prime minister benjamin netanyahu as a "" disgraceful "" attempt to interfere in the war . "" the attempt of the prosecutor of the international criminal court , karim khan , to reverse the creation will not succeed - the parallel of the prosecutor between the terrorist organization hamas and the state of israel is despicable and disgusting . "" he said in a post on x.before adding : "" the state of israel is not a party to the court and does not recognize its authority . "" the outrage expressed by the prime minister , and echoed by israel’s political leadership , was generated by pages of carefully chosen legal language in a statement issued by mr khan , the icc chief prosecutor who is a british king’s counsel . word by word , line by line , they add up to a devastating series of allegations against the three most prominent leaders of hamas as well as israel’s prime minister and defence minister.a determination to apply international law and the laws of armed conflict to all parties , no matter who they are , lies at the heart of mr khan’s statement in which he lays out his justification for requesting arrest warrants . "" no foot soldier , no commander , no civilian leader - no one - can act with impunity . "" the law , he says , cannot be applied selectively . if that happens , "" we will be creating conditions for its collapse "" . it is the decision to hold both sides ’ conduct up to the template of international law that is causing so much anger , and not just in israel . us president joe biden said it was "" outrageous "" to apply for arrest warrants . there was "" no equivalence - none - between israel and hamas "" . hamas demanded the withdrawal of the allegations against its leaders , claiming that the icc’s prosecutor was "" equating the victim with the executioner "" . it said the request to issue arrest warrants for the israeli leadership came seven months too late , after "" the israeli occupation committed thousands of crimes "" . mr khan does not make direct comparisons between the two sides , except to lay out his claim that they have both committed a series of war crimes and crimes against humanity . he also emphasises that this latest war comes in the context of "" an international armed conflict between israel and palestine , and a non-international armed conflict between israel and hamas "" . the court treats palestine as a state as it has observer status at the united nations , which meant it was able to sign up to the rome statute which created the icc . mr netanyahu has declared that palestinians will never have independence on his watch . instead of seeing disgraceful and false parallels between , as israel’s president isaac herzog put it , "" these atrocious terrorists and a democratically elected government of israel "" , human rights groups have applauded the way that the icc prosecutor is seeking to apply the law to both sides . b'tselem , a leading israeli human rights organisation , said the warrants marked "" israel’s rapid decline into a moral abyss "" . "" the international community is signalling to israel that it can no longer maintain its policy of violence , killing and destruction without accountability , "" it added.human rights campaigners have complained for many years that powerful western countries , led by the us , turn a blind eye to israeli violations of international law , even as they condemn and sanction other states who are not in their camp . the actions being taken by mr khan and his team are , they believe , long overdue.mr khan says that the three main leaders of hamas committed war crimes that include extermination , murder , hostage-taking , rape and torture . the men named are yahya sinwar , the hamas leader in gaza , mohammed deif , the commander of the qassam brigades , its military wing , and ismail haniyeh , head of the hamas political bureau.as part of their investigation , karim khan and his team interviewed victims and survivors of the 7 october attacks . he said hamas had assaulted fundamental human values : "" the love within a family , the deepest bonds between a parent and a child were contorted to inflict unfathomable pain through calculated cruelty and extreme callousness "" . israel , mr khan said , does have the right to defend itself . but "" unconscionable crimes "" did not "" absolve israel of its obligation to comply with international humanitarian law "" . the failure to do that , he said , justified issuing warrants for the arrest of mr netanyahu and defence minister yoav gallant for crimes including starvation of civilians as a weapon of war , murder , extermination , and intentional attacks on civilians . from the start of israel’s response to the hamas attacks of 7 october , president biden has issued a series of rebukes to israel , expressing concern that it was killing too many palestinian civilians and destroying too much civilian infrastructure in gaza . but in a careful balancing act with a close ally which he has always supported , mr biden and his administration have not spelt out in public about what they mean.mr khan makes his interpretation crystal clear . israel , he says , has chosen criminal means to achieve its war aims in gaza - "" namely , intentionally causing death , starvation , great suffering , and serious injury "" to civilians.a panel of judges at the icc now will consider whether to issue the arrest warrants . states signed up to the icc’s rome statute would then be obliged to detain the men if they had the chance . the 124 signatories do not include russia , china and the us . israel has not signed either . but the icc has ruled that it does have legal authority to prosecute criminal acts in the war because the palestinians are signatories.if the arrest warrants are issued , it would mean that mr netanyahu , israel’s longest-serving prime minister , would not be able to visit close western allies without risking arrest . uk prime minister rishi sunak said the icc’s actions were "" not helpful to reaching a pause in the fighting , getting hostages out or humanitarian aid in "" . but if the warrants are issued , britain would have to make the arrests , unless it could argue successfully that mr netanyahu had diplomatic immunity . an all-important exception for mr netanyahu and mr gallant is the us . the white house believes the icc does not have jurisdiction in the conflict , a position that might widen the split inside joe biden’s democratic party over the war . progressives have already welcomed the icc’s action . staunch allies of israel among the democrats might support republican moves to pass a law to sanction icc officials or ban them from the us . as rumours of impending indictments churned through europe , america and the middle east weeks ago , a group of republican senators issued the kind of threat to mr khan and his staff that they might have heard in a movie . "" target israel and we will target you . . . you have been warned . "" yoav gallant would also be unable to travel freely . the words he used when announcing that israel would besiege gaza has been frequently quoted by critics of israel’s conduct . two days after the hamas attacks on 7 october , mr gallant said : "" i have ordered a complete siege on the gaza strip . there will be no electricity , no food , no fuel , everything is closed … we are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly "" . mr khan writes in his statement that "" israel has intentionally and systematically deprived the civilian population in all parts of gaza of objects indispensable to human survival "" . famine , he says , is present in parts of gaza and imminent in others . israel denies there is a famine , claiming that food shortages are caused not by their siege - but by hamas thefts and un incompetence.if an arrest warrant is granted for ismail haniyeh , the head of the hamas political branch , he will have to think harder about his regular trips to meet senior arab leaders . he is likely to spend much more time at his base in qatar , which like israel , did not sign the rome statute that set up the icc.the other two accused hamas leaders , yahya sinwar and mohammed deif , are believed to be hiding somewhere inside gaza . an arrest warrant does not add much to the pressures on them . israel has been trying to kill them for the last seven months.the warrant would also put mr netanyahu in a category of accused leaders that also includes russian president vladmir putin , and late colonel muammar gaddafi of libya . mr putin faces an arrest warrant for the unlawful deportation and transfer of children from ukraine to russia . before he was killed by his own people , col gaddafi’s arrest warrant was for murder and persecution of unarmed civilians . it is not attractive company for benjamin netanyahu , the leader of a state that prides itself on its democracy .",israel gaza war : more rafah evacuations as israel steps up operations
2024-05-21T05:24:08.698Z,BBC,"medical workers in israel have told the bbc that palestinian detainees from gaza are routinely kept shackled to hospital beds , blindfolded , sometimes naked , and forced to wear nappies – a practice one medic said amounted to “ torture ” . a whistle-blower detailed how procedures in one military hospital were “ routinely ” carried out without painkillers , causing “ an unacceptable amount of pain ” to detainees.another whistle-blower said painkillers were used “ selectively ” and “ in a very limited way ” during an invasive medical procedure on a gazan detainee in a public hospital.he also said critically ill patients being held in makeshift military facilities were being denied proper treatment because of a reluctance by public hospitals to transfer and treat them . one detainee , taken from gaza for questioning by the israeli army and later released , told the bbc his leg had to be amputated because he was denied treatment for an infected wound.a senior doctor working inside the military hospital at the centre of the allegations denied that any amputations were the direct result of conditions there , but described the shackles and other restraints used by guards as “ dehumanisation ” . the israeli army said detainees at the facility were treated “ appropriately and carefully ” . the two whistle-blowers the bbc spoke to were both in positions to assess the medical treatment of detainees . both asked to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the issue among their colleagues.their accounts are supported by a report , published in february by physicians for human rights in israel , which said that israel’s civilian and military prisons had become “ an apparatus of retribution and revenge ” and that detainees ’ human rights were being violated - in particular their right to health . concerns over the treatment of sick and injured detainees have centred on a military field hospital , at the sde teiman military base in southern israel.the field hospital was set up by israel’s health ministry after the hamas attacks specifically to treat gazan detainees , after some public hospitals and staff expressed a reluctance to treat fighters captured on the day of the hamas attacks.since then , israeli forces have rounded up large numbers of people from gaza and taken them to bases like sde teiman for interrogation . those suspected of fighting for hamas are sent to israeli detention centres ; many others are released back to gaza without charge.the army does not publish details of the detainees it is holding . patients at the sde teiman hospital are kept blindfolded and permanently shackled to their beds by all four limbs , according to several medics responsible for treating patients there.they are also made to wear nappies , rather than use a toilet.israel’s army said in response that handcuffing of detainees in the sde teiman hospital was “ examined individually and daily , and carried out in cases where the security risk requires it ” . it said that nappies [ diapers ] were used “ only for detainees who have undergone medical procedures for which their movement is limited ” . but witnesses , including the facility’s senior anaesthiologist , yoel donchin , say both the use of nappies and handcuffs are universal in the hospital ward . “ the army create the patient to be 100 % dependent , like a baby , ” he said . “ you are cuffed , you are with diapers , you need water , you need everything – it’s dehumanisation ” . dr donchin said there was no individual assessment of the need for restraints , and that even those patients who were unable to walk – for example , those with leg amputations – were handcuffed to the bed . he described the practice as “ stupid ” . two witnesses at the facility in the early weeks of the gaza war told us that patients there were kept naked under the blankets.one doctor with knowledge of conditions there said prolonged cuffing to beds would cause “ huge suffering , horrible suffering ” , describing it as “ torture ” and saying patients would start to feel pain after a few hours.others have spoken of the risk of long-term nerve-damage . footage of gazan detainees released after interrogation shows injuries and scarring around their wrists and legs.last month , israel’s daily haaretz newspaper published allegations made by a doctor at the sde teiman site that leg amputations had been carried out on two prisoners , because of cuffing injuries.the allegations were made , the paper said , in a private letter sent by the doctor to government ministers and the attorney-general , in which such amputations were described as “ unfortunately a routine event ” . the bbc has not been able to independently verify this allegation.dr donchin said that amputations were not the direct result of cuffing and had involved other factors – such as infection , diabetes or problems with blood vessels . israeli medical guidelines stipulate that no patient should be restrained unless there is a specific security reason for doing so , and that the minimum level of restraint should be used.the head of the country’s medical ethics board , yossi walfisch , after a visit to the site , said all patients had a right to be treated without being handcuffed , but that the safety of staff prevailed over other ethical considerations . “ terrorists are given proper medical treatment , ” he said in a published letter , “ with the aim of keeping restraints to a minimum and while maintaining the safety of the treating staff . ” many gazans detained by israel’s army are released without charge after interrogation.dr donchin said complaints from medical staff at the sde teiman military hospital had led to changes , including a shift to looser handcuffs . he said he insisted on guards removing restraints before any surgical procedure . “ it’s not pleasant to work there , ” he said . “ i know it’s against the ethical code to treat someone cuffed in the bed . but what’s the alternative ? is it better to let them die ? i don’t think so . ” but reports suggest the attitudes of medical staff towards detainees vary widely , in both military and civilian hospitals . a whistle-blower who worked at the sde teiman field hospital back in october , shortly after the hamas attacks on israel , described cases of patients being given inadequate amounts of painkillers , including anaesthetic.he said a doctor once refused his request that an elderly patient be given painkillers while they were opening up a recent , infected amputation wound . “ [ the patient ] started trembling from pain , and so i stop and say ‘ we can’t go on , you need to give him analgesia ’ , ” he said.the doctor told him it was too late to administer it.the witness said such procedures were “ routinely done without analgesia ” resulting in “ an unacceptable amount of pain ” . on another occasion , he was asked by a suspected hamas fighter to intercede with the surgical team to increase the levels of morphine and anaesthetic during repeated surgeries.the message was passed on , but the suspect again regained consciousness during the next operation and was in a lot of pain . the witness said both he and other colleagues felt there was a sense in which it had been a deliberate act of revenge.the army said in response to these allegations that violence against detainees was “ absolutely prohibited ” , and that it regularly briefed its forces on the conduct required of them . any concrete details of violence or humiliation would be examined , it said . a second whistle-blower said the situation at sde teiman was only part of the problem , which extended into public hospitals . the bbc is calling him “ yoni ” to protect his identity.in the days that followed the 7 october attacks , he said , hospitals in southern israel were faced with the challenge of treating both wounded fighters and wounded victims , often in the same emergency departments.hamas gunmen had just attacked israeli communities along the border fence with gaza , killing about 1,200 people and kidnapping some 250 others . “ the atmosphere was extremely emotional , ” yoni said . “ hospitals were completely overwhelmed , both psychologically and in terms of capacity . ” “ there were instances where i heard staff discuss whether detainees from gaza should get painkillers . or ways to perform certain procedures that can turn the treatment into punishment . ” conversations like this were not uncommon , he said , even if actual instances appeared very rare . “ i have knowledge of one case where painkillers were used selectively , in a very limited way , during a procedure , ” he told the bbc . “ the patient did not receive any explanation of what was going on . so , if you put together [ that ] someone is undergoing an invasive procedure , which involves even incisions , and doesn’t know about that , and is blindfolded , then the line between treatment and assault thins out . ” we asked the health ministry to respond to these allegations , but they directed us to the idf . yoni also said that the sde teiman field hospital was not equipped to treat severely injured patients , but that some of those held there in the early months of the war had fresh gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen.he said at least one critically ill man was kept there because of a reluctance by public hospitals to accept his transfer for treatment , adding that doctors at the base were “ frustrated ” by the situation.sufian abu salah , a 43-year-old taxi driver from khan youis , was one of dozens of men detained during raids by israel's army and taken to a military base for questioning.he said soldiers carried out severe beatings during the journey and also on arrival at the base , where he was denied treatment for a minor wound on his foot , which then became infected . “ my leg got infected and turned blue , and as soft as a sponge , ” he told the bbc.after a week , he said , the guards took him to hospital , beating him on his injured leg on the way . two operations to clean his wound did not work , he told the bbc . “ afterwards , they took me to a public hospital , where the doctor gave me two options : my leg or my life . ” he chose his life . after they amputated his leg , he was sent back to the military base , and later released back to gaza . "" this period was mental and physical torture , ” he said . “ i can’t describe it . i was detained with two legs and now i have only one . every now and then , i cry . ” the idf did not respond to the specific allegations about sufian’s treatment , but said the claims of violence towards him during his arrest or detention “ were unknown and will be examined ” . in the days after the 7 october attack , israel’s health ministry issued a directive that all gazan detainees should be treated in military or prison hospitals , with the sde teiman field hospital created specifically to fill this role.the decision won the backing of many in israel’s medical establishment , with yossi walfisch , praising it as the solution to “ an ethical dilemma ” , which would remove responsibility for treating “ hamas terrorists ” from the public health system.others have called for the closure of sde teiman , describing the situation there as “ an unprecedented low point for the medical profession , and medical ethics . ” “ my fear is that what we’re doing in sde teiman won’t allow a return to the way it was before , ” one doctor told the bbc . “ because things that looked unreasonable to us before , will look reasonable when this crisis is over . ” yoel donchin , the anaesthesiologist , said medical staff at the field hospital sometimes gathered together to cry over the situation there . “ the moment our hospital closes , ” he said , “ we’ll celebrate . ” additional reporting by : naomi scherbel-ball , gidi kleiman , aisha kherallah",israel troops continue posting abuse footage despite pledge to act

"" international law and the laws of armed conflict apply to all , "" mr khan said . "" no foot soldier , no commander , no civilian leader - no-one - can act with impunity . ” in a statement , mr gallant insisted that israeli forces were fighting in gaza “ in accordance with international law , while taking unprecedented measures to facilitate humanitarian aid ” . “ i stand with , support , and commend our troops , who are defending our people and fulfilling the extraordinary privilege and obligation of defending ourselves , by ourselves , ” he said.he added : “ the attempt made by the icc prosecutor karim khan to turn things around will not succeed - the parallel he has drawn between the hamas terrorist organization and the state of israel is despicable . ” mr gallant reiterated that israel was not a signatory of the rome statute , the icc’s founding treaty , and did not recognise its authority . “ karim khan's attempt to deny the state of israel the right to defend herself and ensure the release of the hostages held in gaza must be rejected explicitly . ” there was no immediate response from mr khan to the remarks or to the statement made by mr netanyahu , who denounced the warrant applications for him and mr gallant as a “ moral outrage of historic proportions ” . hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by israel , the us , uk and other countries - demanded the “ cancellation of all arrest warrants issued against leaders of the palestinian resistance ” and denounced what it called mr khan's "" attempts . . . to equate the victim with the executioner "" . the group also complained that the application for warrants against mr netanyahu and mr gallant had come “ seven months late ” , and that other israeli political and military leaders had not been named alongside them . the israeli government also urged on tuesday “ the nations of the civilised , free world - nations who despise terrorists and anyone who supports them - to stand by israel ” . “ make sure the icc understands where you stand , ” spokesman tal heinrich told a briefing . “ oppose the prosecutor's decision and declare that , even if warrants are issued , you do not intend to enforce them . because this is not about our leaders . it's about our survival .

"" mr karhi claims the images allegedly shared were transmitting "" positions of our forces in the northern gaza strip while putting them at risk in accordance with security opinions and the government's decision "" . earlier this month , the ministry shut down al jazeera's operations in israel , accusing it of being a "" hamas mouthpiece "" and harming national security . al jazeera rejected the allegation that it was and denounced the ban as a "" criminal act ” that violated human rights . it was also condemned by journalism organisations as a blow to press freedom.al jazeera has continued operations in the occupied west bank and gaza strip , which foreign journalists have been banned from entering since the start of the war between israel and hamas in october . the associated press reported that officials from the israeli communication ministry seized its camera broadcasting a general view of northern gaza from the southern town of sderot on tuesday afternoon . the officials “ handed the ap a piece of paper , signed by communications minister shlomo karhi , alleging it was violating the country’s foreign broadcaster law ” , it said , adding that the agency had rejected a verbal order to cease the live transmission last thursday.the agency stressed that it complied with israel’s military censorship rules , which prohibit broadcasts of details like troop movements that could endanger soldiers.however , the communications ministry accused the ap of broadcasting footage of gaza from the balcony of a house in sderot that included “ the activity of israel defense forces combat soldiers and their location ” . "" even though communications ministry inspectors warned them that they were breaking the law and that they should remove al jazeera as a recipient of their content and not transfer their broadcast to al jazeera , they continued to do so , ” a statement said .

2024-05-21T22:12:19.907Z,BBC,"us secretary of state antony blinken has suggested he will work with lawmakers on potential sanctions against the international criminal court as its prosecutor seeks arrest warrants for senior israeli officials.mr blinken told a congressional hearing he was "" committed "" to taking action against the "" profoundly wrong-headed decision "" . his comments come amid a republican push to impose sanctions on icc officials , which may see a vote as soon as this week.the united states is not a member of the court but has backed previous prosecutions , including the icc's arrest warrant for russian president vladimir putin over the war in ukraine . at a tuesday hearing of the senate foreign relations committee , james risch , its top republican , asked whether mr blinken would support legislation to address the icc "" sticking its nose in the business of countries that have an independent , legitimate , democratic judicial system "" . "" we want to work with you on a bipartisan basis to find an appropriate response . i'm committed to doing that , "" the secretary of state said.mr blinken said "" there's no question we have to look at the appropriate steps to take to deal with , again , what is a profoundly wrong-headed decision "" . the icc's chief prosecutor karim khan announced on monday that he had applied for arrest warrants against israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu and defence minister yoav gallant.mr khan is also seeking arrest warrants for three hamas officials - yahya sinwar , its leader in gaza , mohammed deif , the commander of its qassam brigades military wing , and ismail haniyeh , the head of its political bureau . us president joe biden said on monday it was "" outrageous "" to apply for arrest warrants . there was "" no equivalence - none - between israel and hamas "" , he added.mr blinken's remarks echoed the broader pushback in washington over the court's decision.at least two measures imposing sanctions on the icc had already been introduced in congress as the court ramped up its inquiry into israel's handling of the war in gaza.support on capitol hill appears to be coalescing around a bill launched earlier this month by texas republican chip roy.the illegitimate court counteraction act would target icc officials involved with the case by blocking their entry to the us , revoking any current us visas they hold , and prohibiting them from any property transactions within the country - unless the court ceases its cases against "" protected persons of the united states and its allies "" . at least 37 lawmakers in the republican-led house are now co-sponsoring the legislation , including elise stefanik , the chamber's third highest-ranking republican.ms stefanik is fresh off a visit to israel , where she met with mr netanyahu , spoke at the knesset and met with the families of hostages trapped in gaza.the court "" equivocates a peaceful nation protecting its right to exist with radical terror groups that commit genocide "" , she told the bbc in a statement.andy barr of kentucky , another republican supporting the bill , said further pursuit of the icc's case against israel must "" be met with the full force of our sanctions "" . less clear , however , is whether democratic lawmakers will get behind the effort.the party's moderate and liberal wings have grappled with mr biden's israel policy for months , as young progressive voters have pushed the president to more sharply criticise the netanyahu government's operations in gaza.ohio's greg landsman , one of a few democrats who voted last week to reverse mr biden's pause on a weapons shipment to israel , told the bbc he hopes congress will issue a bipartisan rebuke of the icc "" to send the strongest message possible "" . "" the decision [ to seek arrest warrants ] will only further inflame tensions and divisions , embolden anti-israel conspiracies , and ultimately , it will undermine the credibility of the icc , "" he said in a statement.republican house speaker mike johnson urged chuck schumer , the senate's top democrat , to sign a letter on tuesday inviting mr netanyahu to address a joint meeting of congress.in march , mr schumer called for new elections in israel but he described the icc's case on monday as "" reprehensible "" . sen chris coons , a democrat from delaware and member of the senate foreign relations committee , told the bbc that he was unsure about moves to sanction icc officials . "" i'm not there yet imposing sanctions on the icc , as opposed to looking to see whether the off ramp of a ruling by the judges of the icc that they're not going to proceed with warrants is something i think may come in the next couple of days , "" the democrat said . but mr coons added that he is discussing taking action with his committee colleagues from both parties . but some left-wing democrats have expressed their support for the icc's actions.minnesota congresswoman ilhan omar said the court's allegations are "" significant "" and the us must support its work as it has done on past occasions , including in the case of libya . "" the application for arrest warrants is merely the beginning of a judicial process , "" she wrote in a statement on monday .

2024-05-22T05:53:38.541Z,BBC,"iran’s supreme leader has presided over a funeral for the country’s late president , foreign minister and others killed in a helicopter crash on sunday.ayatollah ali khamenei led prayers at tehran university , where caskets carrying the dead were draped in iranian flags.president ebrahim raisi died alongside foreign minister hossein amir-abdollahian and six others in a helicopter crash near the border with azerbaijan.authorities had warned against demonstrations against the funeral procession and insults posted online . “ oh allah , we didn’t see anything but good from him , ” ayatollah khamenei said in the standard prayer for the dead in arabic . iran’s acting president , mohammad mokhber , stood nearby and openly wept during the service.people then carried the coffins out on their shoulders , with chants of “ death to america ” heard outside.they loaded them onto a trailer for a procession through downtown tehran to azadi square , where raisi gave speeches in the past . in attendance were top leaders of iran’s paramilitary revolutionary guard , one of the country’s major power centres.representatives from more than 68 countries were also in attendance , according to the government-run irna news agency . also on hand was ismail haniyeh of hamas , the militant group that iran has armed and supported during the ongoing israel-hamas war.haniyeh is widely considered hamas's overall leader and has been a prominent member of the movement since 1980 . the us department of state designated him a terrorist in 2018 . “ i come in the name of the palestinian people , in the name of the resistance factions of gaza . . . to express our condolences , ” haniyeh said.he also described meeting raisi in tehran during ramadan , the holy muslim fasting month.he said he heard the president say that "" the palestinian issue "" remains the key one of the muslim world , which "" must fulfil their obligations to the palestinians to liberate their land "" . he also claimed that raisi called hamas's 7 october attack in israel , which saw 1,200 people killed and 250 others taken hostage , an "" earthquake in the heart of the zionist entity "" . ayatollah khamenei met several foreign leaders , including pakistan's prime minister shehbaz sharif and lebanese parliament speaker nabih berri , as they arrived in tehran for the funeral.a delegation from the taliban of afghanistan , which included their foreign minister amir khan muttaqi , are also expected to have attended the ceremony.iran’s theocracy declared five days of mourning over sunday’s crash , encouraging people to attend the public mourning sessions.typically , government employees and schoolchildren attend such events en masse , while others take part out of patriotism , curiosity or to witness historic events.for iran’s shiite theocracy , mass demonstrations have been crucial to demonstrating the legitimacy of their leadership since millions thronged the streets of tehran to welcome grand ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in 1979 during the islamic revolution , and also attended his funeral 10 years later.an estimated one million turned out in 2020 for processions for the late revolutionary guard general qasem soleimani , who was killed in a us drone strike in baghdad . across the capital , large banners were raised hailing raisi as "" the martyr of service "" , while others bade "" farewell to the servant of the disadvantaged "" . some residents in tehran received texts urging them to attend wednesday's ceremonies , the afp news agency reported.footage carried by state tv showed streets filled with mourners , many of whom were carrying pictures of raisi or the iranian flag.funeral rites for the men began on tuesday in the city of tabriz and the shiite clerical centre of qom , where thousands of mourners attended ceremonies.after wednesday's procession in the capital , raisi's remains will be moved to south khorasan province , before being transferred to his home city of mashhad in the northeast.he will then be buried on thursday evening in the city after funeral rites at the imam reza shrine.raisi , a hardline cleric , was a highly divisive figure in iran . in the 1980s , he oversaw the execution of scores of opposition activists while working as a prosecutor.he unleashed a brutal crackdown against demonstrators angered by the killing of 22-year-old mahsa amini in 2022 . she died three days after she was detained by morality police in the capital for allegedly violating iran's strict rules requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab , or headscarf.but his ultra-conservative outlook won favour with supporters of the regime , and raisi was viewed as a possible successor to ayatollah khamenei .",columbia protesters take over building after defying deadline
2024-05-22T06:59:04.236Z,BBC,"food distribution in the southern gaza city of rafah has been suspended due to a lack of supplies and insecurity , the un says.the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa , warned its distribution centre and a world food programme warehouse were now inaccessible because of the ongoing israeli military operation against hamas in eastern rafah.at least 815,000 of the more than a million people taking refuge in rafah have fled since the israeli operation began two weeks ago.unrwa also said its health centres had not received any medical supplies in the past 10 days . the news came as the us said it did not believe any of the aid that had entered northern gaza through a newly-completed floating pier had been distributed to palestinians by humanitarian organisations.on saturday , crowds of palestinians desperate for food intercepted a number of wfp lorries transporting aid from the pier , which prompted the agency to suspend deliveries until new routes could be identified.israel launched a military campaign to destroy hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern israel on 7 october , during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.more than 35,640 people have been killed in gaza since then , according to the territory's hamas-run health ministry . after seven months of war in gaza , israel has insisted victory is impossible without taking rafah and eliminating the last remaining hamas battalions there.but the un and western powers have warned that an all-out assault could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe.on 6 may , the israel defense forces ( idf ) ordered residents of eastern rafah to evacuate for their own safety before it began what it called “ precise operations ” against hamas operatives and infrastructure.since then , troops have advanced into central neighbourhoods and taken control of the rafah border crossing with egypt . the crossing remains closed , while the un says the nearby kerem shalom crossing with israel is too dangerous to access.on monday , israel’s defence minister , yoav gallant , declared that it was “ committed to broadening the ground operation in rafah ” . unrwa said in a report on tuesday that it had been forced to suspend food distribution because the israeli operation had left its distribution centre and a wfp warehouse inaccessible.when asked about the ramifications , un spokesperson stephane dujarric told reporters in new york : “ people don’t eat . ” it is not clear how many people are still living in the rafah area . but the head of unwa implied it was more than 800,000 on sunday , when he said that “ nearly half of the population are on the road ” . the idf has told them to head to an “ expanded humanitarian area ” that stretches from nearby al-mawasi to the central town of deir al-balah and said they will find field hospitals , tents , food and other supplies.however , the un has said nowhere is safe in gaza and that the designated area is already crammed with people and does not have clean drinking water supplies and sanitation facilities.the idf said on tuesday that its soldiers were continuing “ targeted raids on . . . terrorist infrastructure and buildings ” in eastern rafah , and that it had “ eliminated dozens of terrorists ” who tried to approach them.another statement said it was facilitating “ the passage of hundreds of trucks containing food , water , medical supplies , and shelter equipment ” across gaza.it reported that 381 aid lorries were transferred via kerem shalom on tuesday and that another 70 entered northern gaza via the erez west crossing . but it also noted 650 lorry loads remained waiting for collection by aid agencies at the two crossings.as well as saying that kerem shalom is difficult to access safely , the un has noted that areas in the vicinity of erez west are under other israeli evacuation orders . a un-backed assessment published in march warned that 1.1 million people in gaza were facing catastrophic levels of hunger and that famine was imminent by may in northern gaza , where an estimated 300,000 people are trapped.no formal famine declaration has been made , but wfp executive director cindy mccain said earlier this month that “ there is full-blown famine in the north , and it's moving its way south ” . on friday , the first lorry loads of aid rolled off the us military’s floating pier south-west of gaza city , which us officials have said will “ surge humanitarian assistance ” . us central command announced early on tuesday that 569 tonnes of aid had been delivered by cargo ships that sailed from cyprus.but later in the day , pentagon press secretary maj gen pat ryder told reporters in washington that none of those supplies had yet been distributed by humanitarian organisations.mr dujarric said contractors were able on friday to drive 10 aid lorries from the pier to a wfp warehouse in the central town of deir al-balah . but the next day 11 of the 16 lorries which set off were intercepted by hungry crowds . "" these trucks were traveling through areas where there'd been no aid , ” mr dujarric said . “ i think people feared that they would never see aid . they grabbed what they could . ” gen ryder said there had been discussions among the us , israel and the un "" to identify alternative routes for the safe movement of staff and cargo ” . “ we do anticipate that assistance will be distributed in the coming days , of course , conditions permitting , ” he added.meanwhile , the head of the world health organization warned that the largest partially functional hospital in northern gaza was reportedly hit four times on tuesday , as battles rage between israeli forces and palestinian armed groups in the nearby jabalia area.the idf said it was reviewing reports from medics at kamal adwan hospital in beit lahia that its emergency department had been struck by israeli missiles , forcing them to rush patients on hospital beds to a street outside.the who also said al-awda hospital in jabalia had been besieged since sunday , with staff , patients and people accompanying them trapped inside.tens of thousands of civilians have fled jabalia since 11 may , when the idf said it would re-enter the area because hamas had regrouped there .",israeli protesters attack gaza aid trucks in west bank

"" this distorted step by these countries is an injustice to the memory of the victims of 7/10 , a blow to efforts to return the 128 hostages , and a boost to hamas and iran's jihadists , which undermines the chance for peace and questions israel’s right to self-defence . "" hamas , which controls gaza and is currently at war with israel , said wednesday's announcements would be a "" turning point in the international position on the palestinian issue "" . in a statement to afp , bassem naim , a senior hamas figure , said the "" brave resistance "" of the palestinian people was behind the move.hamas's rival , the palestinian authority ( pa ) - which controls parts of the israeli-occupied west bank - said norway , spain and ireland had demonstrated their "" unwavering commitment "" to "" delivering the long overdue justice to the palestinian people . "" addressing the "" people of israel "" , mr harris said : "" ireland is resolute and unequivocal in recognising the state of israel and israel’s right to exist securely and in peace with its neighbours . "" "" let me be clear that ireland condemns the barbaric massacre carried out by hamas on 7 october last , "" he said.mr harris called for the release of hostages taken by hamas "" to the arms of their loved ones "" , but added that "" hamas is not the palestinian people "" .

2024-05-22T10:54:23.419Z,BBC,"ireland , norway , and spain have announced they will formally recognise a palestinian state from 28 may.spain and ireland said the decision was not against israel nor in favour of hamas , but rather in support of peace . israel reacted angrily , warning the move would mean more instability in the region and recalling its ambassadors to all three countries . both hamas and its rival , the palestinian authority , have welcomed the recognition . norway was first to make its announcement wednesday in a move co-ordinated with the other two countries.prime minister jonas gahr støre said in an address that the move was "" in support of moderate forces that are on a retreating front in a protracted and cruel conflict "" . "" this is an investment in the only solution that can bring lasting peace in the middle east , "" he added , referring to the so-called two-state solution which would see an israeli and a palestinian state existing peacefully next to each other.ireland and spain followed suit soon after .

"" it is not in favour of hamas , which is something that has been said . this recognition is not against anyone , it is in favour of peace and coexistence .

"" israel will not go over this in silence - there will be other serious consequences , "" he said . mr katz also said the three countries ' ambassadors in israel will be summoned for "" reprimand talks "" , during which they will be shown a video of the abduction of female israeli soldiers on 7 october . hamas , which controls gaza and is currently at war with israel , said wednesday's announcements would be a "" turning point in the international position on the palestinian issue "" . in a statement to afp , bassem naim , a senior hamas figure , said the "" brave resistance "" of the palestinian people was behind the move.hamas's rival , the palestinian authority ( pa ) - which controls parts of the israeli-occupied west bank - said norway , spain and ireland had demonstrated their "" unwavering commitment "" to "" delivering the long overdue justice to the palestinian people "" . also on wednesday , the israeli military approved the return of israeli citizens to the sites of three settlements in the occupied west bank , which they had been banned from entering since 2005.israel's parliament had voted to allow its citizens to return in march last year , but military permission was needed for the bill to be enforced.most of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law , though israel disputes this . the issue of palestinian statehood has vexed the international community for decades . since the 7 october attacks , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has doubled down on his opposition to such a plan , saying the creation of a palestinian state would compromise israel's security . about 1,200 people were killed in the unprecedented attacks on 7 october , when hamas gunmen burst into israel . they took 252 others back to gaza as hostages.since then , more than 35,000 people , mostly civilians , have been killed in israel's gaza offensive , according to the hamas-run health ministry.most of the world already recognises the state of palestine . earlier this month , 143 of the 193 members of the united nations general assembly voted in favour of it joining the un , something only states can do.before wednesday's announcements , 17 european countries recognised the state of palestine and most of those took the decision in 1988 when they were part of the soviet bloc . most other european countries , and the us , still believe recognition should come only as part of a long-term two-state solution to the conflict.a white house spokesperson said us president joe biden was a "" strong supporter "" of the two-state solution , and believed "" a palestinian state should be realised through direct negotiations , not through unilateral recognition "" . slovenia and malta have also said recently that they were considering a formal recognition . norway's prime minister also said on wednesday that he hoped the recognition of palestinian statehood by the three countries would bring renewed momentum to the peace talks . long-running negotiations in cairo aimed at securing a truce and further hostage releases are currently stalled.meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in gaza continues to deteriorate . earlier this week , the un said food distribution in the southern gaza city of rafah had been suspended due to a lack of supplies and insecurity . the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court ( icc ) recently applied for arrest warrants for mr netanyahu and hamas's leader in gaza , yahya sinwar , for war crimes . both israel and hamas have condemned the move . israel says an offensive in rafah is needed to eliminate hamas but the international community has warned against it , saying it will greatly exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in gaza . correction 14 june 2024 : this article previously reported that before wednesday's announcements , nine european countries supported palestinian statehood . this has been amended to make clear that 17 european countries had recognised the state of palestine to this point .",israel and egypt row over reopening rafah border crossing
2024-05-22T14:25:54.233Z,BBC,"as fighting and suffering continues in gaza , and violence grows in the west bank , prospects of the palestinian people gaining their own state might seem further away than ever.several european countries are pressing ahead with formally recognising the existence of a palestinian state , but they will not overcome the reality that such ambition still faces huge obstacles.however , tuesday's actions by ireland , spain and norway , announced last week , will put pressure on other countries in europe - including the uk , france and germany - to follow them in supporting palestinian self-determination . “ this is extremely significant , ” one arab diplomat said . “ it reflects european frustration with the israeli government’s refusal to listen . "" and it puts pressure on the eu to follow suit . ” but israeli ministers insist this will encourage hamas and reward terrorism , further reducing the chances of a negotiated settlement.most countries - about 139 in all - formally recognise a palestinian state . on 10 may , 143 out of 193 members of the united nations ’ general assembly voted in favour of a palestinian bid for full un membership , something that is only open to states . palestine currently has a kind of enhanced observer status at the un , which gives them a seat but not a vote in the assembly . it is also recognised by various international organisations including the arab league and the organisation of islamic cooperation.a minority of european countries already recognise a palestinian state . they comprise hungary , poland , romania , the czech republic , slovakia , and bulgaria which adopted the position 1988 ; and others including sweden and cyprus.but many european nations - and the united states - say they will recognise a palestinian state only as part of a long-term political solution to the conflict in the middle east . this is often referred to as the "" two-state solution "" where both israelis and palestinians agree to have their own states with their own borders.european countries and the us differ over when they should recognise a palestinian state . ireland , spain and norway say they are doing so now to kick-start a political process . they argue there will be a sustained solution to the current crisis only if both sides can aim at some kind of political horizon . these countries are also responding to domestic political pressures to show more support for palestinians.in the past , the position of many western countries was that palestinian statehood should be a prize for a final peace agreement . but lord cameron , the uk foreign secretary , and some other european countries have in recent months shifted their positions , saying the recognition of palestinian statehood could come earlier , to help drive momentum towards a political settlement . in february , french president emmanuel macron said : “ the recognition of a palestinian state is not a taboo for france . ” and earlier this month , france supported palestinian membership of the un in the general assembly vote.the us has privately discussed this issue with european allies , but is more cautious and wants a clearer sense of what the policy would mean in practice . so the key debate behind the scenes is about when these holdout countries should recognise a palestinian state : when formal peace talks begin between israelis and palestinians , when israel and saudi arabia normalise diplomatic relations , when israel fails to undertake certain actions , or when the palestinians take certain actions . in other words , they want recognition of the state of palestine to be a big moment designed to achieve a diplomatic outcome . “ it is a big card that western countries have to play , ” one western official said . “ we don’t want to throw it away . ” the problem is that recognising a palestinian state is largely a symbolic gesture if it does not also address the vital concomitant questions . what should the borders be ? where should the capital be located ? what should both sides do first to make it happen ? these are difficult questions that have not been agreed - or even answered - satisfactorily for decades.as of last week , a few more countries in europe now believe there should be a palestinian state.supporters will cheer the move , opponents will decry it . the grim reality for palestinians on the ground is unlikely to change .",gaza war : why is the un citing lower death toll for women and children ?

"" [ the president’s death ] was a difficult issue for us , but the iranian nation will turn this bitter incident into an opportunity , ” he told the speaker of lebanon’s parliament , nabih berri.raisi was close to the 85-year-old supreme leader , who is the ultimate authority in the islamic republic , and was widely seen as a potential successor.tens of thousands of people have taken part in the funeral processions in recent days , which the government and state media have portrayed as demonstrations of national unity . "" how do i find someone like him ? i'm really worried about that , "" mohsen , a cleric from qom , told afp news agency at wednesday’s funeral procession in tehran . "" as far as i know , we don't have anyone of his stature . "" civil servant ali mousavi-nejad , said the presence of so many people “ sends a message to the enemies of the revolution ” . however , many more people have stayed at home , with some even celebrating the president’s death despite prosecutors warning that they could face prosecution.millions despised raisi for overseeing the deadly crackdown on the “ woman , life , freedom ” protests that erupted in 2022 , a year after he took office.he also faced calls for an international investigation into his alleged role on the "" death committee "" which ordered the mass executions of political prisoners in the 1980s.his time as president will also be remembered for a deepening economic hardship and an unprecedented direct military confrontation with israel last month , which raised fears of a regional war.a female student , who took part in the protests two years ago , told the bbc : “ people are so happy . most of them are wearing white or bright colours and smiling at each other . ” “ the image they keep showing to the world [ is ] that we’re all sad , that we loved him . but it isn’t true . ” she added : “ today , when i attended my classes , there was a big banner of his face in the university’s main hallway . and the students would show the middle finger to his picture . ” the student also said the streets of tehran were "" full of security patrols "" to deter protests or celebrations.hadi ghaemi , the director of the us-based center for human rights in iran ( chri ) advocacy group , said raisi’s death should not be exploited to further crack down on civil society . “ raisi was a pillar of a system that jails , tortures , and kills people for daring to criticize state policies , ” he said . “ his death has enabled him to escape being held accountable for his many crimes and the state’s atrocities committed under his rule . ” iranian authorities say they are still investigating what caused the helicopter crash in which he died.officials have said the aircraft - a decades-old , us-made bell 212 - hit a mountainside as it flew to the north-western city of tabriz in fog and heavy rain.raisi was travelling with amir-abdollahian , the governor of east azerbaijan province , malek rahmati , and tabriz’s friday prayer leader , ayatollah mohammad ali al-e hashem , as well as the head of the presidential security team and the helicopter’s three crew following the inauguration of two dams on the border with azerbaijan .",us and eu eye new sanctions on iran after attack on israel

"" the only pathway to peace is political , "" said ireland's taoiseach simon harris . for british ministers , the focus is how best to support the palestinian authority ( pa ) so it could potentially help govern post-war gaza . the foreign secretary , lord cameron , told the house of lords this week that he was pushing israel to stop withholding money from the pa . not only is israel denying the pa tax revenues , far-right finance minister belazel smotrich is also threatening to cut palestinian banks off from their israeli counterparts . lord cameron said he had told the israeli government : "" you may not think the palestinian authority is ideal . you may think that it fails in many respects . but you need to find a partner that is not hamas that you can work with in gaza and the west bank , and that partner should be the new technocratic government run by the palestinian authority . "" uk treasury officials are understood to be preparing new forms of financial and technical support for the pa . but there are also some within government who are pushing for the uk to be more explicit about its own thoughts for how a palestinian state would be created . "" you can't support a two-state solution and not talk about recognition , "" one senior and well-placed source told me . "" what we lack is a timeline . we agree the starting point : stop the war . and we agree on the creation of a palestinian state . but there's no definition of an irreversible path towards it . we have got to get into that space , otherwise we will be dealing with this for the next 70 years . "" then there are voices from within israel . defence minister yoav gallant has issued a passionate denunciation of benjamin netanyahu's refusal to set out a post-war plan . "" the ' day after hamas ' will only be achieved with palestinian entities taking control of gaza , accompanied by international actors , establishing a governing alternative to hamas rule , "" he said . fellow war cabinet member benny gantz has gone a step further , threatening to resign from the government unless mr netanyahu agreed a six-point plan by 8 june . that included a demilitarised gaza and the establishment of a joint us , european , arab and palestinian administration . the focus of these two former generals is more military than political . they fear - and wish to avoid - the israeli defense forces ( idf ) running gaza in the long run , which mr gallant said would be a "" dangerous course "" for which israel would pay a heavy price in "" bloodshed and victims "" . the united states shares this view . "" it is imperative not only that the conflict in gaza ends as soon as possible , but that israel comes forward with a clear plan for how gaza is going to be governed , secured , redeveloped , "" secretary of state antony blinken told a senate committee hearing this week . without that , he said , israel would face unacceptable options : long-term military occupation and insurgency , the return of hamas , or anarchy and lawlessness . "" we believe that palestinians must be governed by themselves , "" he said . the us is also putting pressure on arab states to agree an international force that could establish security in gaza in the short term . the us would not put its own troops on the ground but wants countries including egypt , jordan , morocco , bahrain and the uae to do so instead . but diplomats say these countries have made clear they would take part only if the west recognised the state of palestine , there was an agreed pathway to a two-state solution , and they came at the invitation of some kind of palestinian leadership . "" ' the day after ' cannot be separated from the political process , it must be part of a comprehensive package , "" one arab diplomat told me . "" no-one will put one foot on the ground unless there is a political process . "" some arab states feel the us has been too focused on trying to secure a deal to normalise diplomatic relations between israel and saudi arabia . they accept this may be key to getting israel's agreement to a wider political settlement , but suspect it is seen too much as a "" silver bullet "" by some us officials . they also think the us needs to think harder about "" the day after "" for israel , engaging more closely with moderate voices who could win popular support for a palestinian-governed gaza . there is discussion , too , about what role turkey could play , using its leverage over hamas to agree some kind of post-war deal . ultimately the key obstacle to any agreement is benjamin netanyahu . he refuses to discuss it apart from categorically opposing any role for the palestinian authority . he fears upsetting hard-right members of his government who favour long-term israeli occupation . but pressure is rising on the prime minister , and one day he may have to choose .

2024-05-28T21:36:07.955Z,BBC,"the us does not believe israel's actions in rafah amount to a "" major ground operation "" that could cross a red line for president joe biden and trigger a possible change in us policy , the white house has said.spokesman john kirby addressed reporters hours after israeli forces reached the centre of the city in southern gaza , and reportedly seized a strategically important hill.mr biden recently said he would limit weapons supplies to israel if it entered rafah's “ population centres ” , where hundreds of thousands of civilians are still believed to be sheltering.mr kirby was also questioned about an israeli strike and a resulting fire that killed at least 45 palestinians on sunday . many of them were women , children , or elderly , who were sheltering at a camp for displaced people.israel has said the strike targeted and killed two senior hamas officials , and that it believes the fire could have been caused by an explosion at a hamas weapons store nearby.speaking to reporters , mr kirby described images from the aftermath of the strike as "" heartbreaking "" and "" horrific "" . “ there should be no innocent life lost here as a result of this conflict , "" he added.the us state department said it was watching closely for the israeli military to conduct a quick and thorough investigation into the strike.pressed by bbc correspondent tom bateman on whether previous such investigations had led to accountability , state department spokesman matthew miller declined to name specific cases . “ you cannot reach a conclusion about the results of these investigations in the middle of a conflict , ” he said.when the white house spokesman was asked whether the strike had violated the limits previously set by president biden , he said he had "" no policy changes to speak to "" . “ we don't support , we won't support a major ground operation in rafah , ” mr kirby said . “ the president said that , should that occur , then it might make him have to make different decisions in terms of support . “ we haven't seen that happen at this point . we have not seen them smash into rafah . "" we have not seen them go in with large units , large numbers of troops , in columns and formations in some sort of co-ordinated manoeuvre against multiple targets on the ground . "" israel has insisted it will not be able to achieve victory in its seven-month war against hamas in gaza without taking rafah and rejected warnings of catastrophic humanitarian consequences.the israel defense forces ( idf ) first began what it called “ targeted ” ground operations against hamas fighters and infrastructure in the east of rafah on 6 may.since then , tanks and troops have gradually pushed into built-up eastern and central areas while also moving northwards along the 13km ( 8-mile ) border with egypt.speaking to cnn on 8 may , president biden said he had made it clear to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu that “ if they go into rafah , i’m not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with rafah , to deal with the cities , to deal with that problem ” . he said he had not suspended the supply of weapons at that point because israel had not yet “ gone into the population centres ” in rafah and that its operations had been “ right on the border ” . the president is facing growing calls at home to put greater pressure on the israeli government to ensure everything is done to minimise the humanitarian impact of the conflict.democratic senator chris van hollen , who visited gaza in january , told the washington post : “ the escalating civilian death toll and deepening humanitarian catastrophe make clear that the biden administration should pause additional offensive military assistance to the netanyahu government until we know that all the president’s requests , including with respect to rafah and the urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance , will be respected . ” in an address to the israeli parliament on monday , mr netanyahu said sunday's strike had been a "" tragic mishap "" but vowed to continue with the rafah operation.describing the aftermath of the strike , mohammad al-mughayyir , an official with gaza’s hamas-run civil defence agency , was quoted as saying by afp news agency : "" we saw charred bodies and dismembered limbs . we also saw cases of amputations , wounded children women , and the elderly . ” an eyewitness named muhannad , himself a displaced resident of gaza , described the air strike : "" when we heard the sound the sky suddenly lit up . "" hamad , another man at the scene , told afp : "" when these rockets fall on a tower block there are dozens of martyrs , so what about when they are tents ? "" the attack has drawn protests from regional governments , including egypt and qatar who have acted as mediators in the conflict , as well as jordan , kuwait , saudi arabia and turkey.egypt said the strike was part of a “ systematic policy ” intended to make gaza “ uninhabitable ” and qatar described it as a "" dangerous violation of international law "" that could “ complicate ongoing mediation efforts "" . jordan accused israel of "" ongoing war crimes "" , while saudi arabia condemned the “ continued massacres "" , and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan vowed "" to hold these barbarians and murderers accountable "" . the un has said around a million people have now fled the fighting in rafah but that several hundred thousand more could still be sheltering there.residents of the city reported heavy bombardment of western districts overnight on monday , and on tuesday the idf said it was continuing operations against "" terror targets "" . witnesses said israeli tanks were stationed at al-awda roundabout , a key landmark and the location of several major banks and government institutions.an eyewitness told the bbc that israeli soldiers had taken up position on top of a building overlooking the area and started shooting at any movement . the allegation could not be independently verified . speaking from rafah on tuesday , sam rose , a spokesman for unrwa , the un’s humanitarian agency for palestinian refugees , told bbc news : "" what we've witnessed over the past 24 hours is an intensification of the bombardments in rafah , and military operations [ which are ] pushing further west into the tal al-sultan district of the city . "" that includes the tented camp that was hit a couple of nights ago . it also includes a large unrwa logistics base and the unrwa health centre which is essentially the beating heart of the humanitarian operation in rafah , and has been for several months . "" these parts of the city have largely emptied out over the past 24 hours . so real concern , real numbness , real fear amongst the population right now . "" the israeli military has denied reports on tuesday that its tank shells hit another tent camp in al-mawasi , on the coast west of rafah , which local officials said had killed at least 21 people.videos of the incident posted to social media and analysed by bbc verify showed multiple people with serious injuries.there was no clear sign of a blast zone or crater , making it impossible to ascertain the cause of the incident . the location - verified through reference to surrounding buildings - lies south of the israeli military's designated humanitarian zone.israel launched a military campaign in gaza to destroy hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern israel on 7 october , during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.at least 36,090 people have been killed in gaza since then , according to the hamas-run health ministry .",borders book festival to end baillie gifford sponsorship deal

2024-05-29T14:29:55.972Z,BBC,"a senior israeli official has said he expects the war against hamas in gaza to continue for at least the rest of this year . "" the fighting in gaza will continue for at least another seven months , ” the prime minister’s national security adviser , tzachi hanegbi , told israel's kan public radio.he also said israel’s military had taken control of 75 % of the buffer zone along the gaza-egypt border , as it pressed ahead with an assault on the southern city of rafah.residents of rafah meanwhile reported that there had been more israeli air strikes and that tanks had mounted raids in central and western areas before retreating . a senior world health organization ( who ) official also warned that rafah’s last hospital was barely functional and that a "" full incursion "" by israeli troops could lead to its closure and a "" substantial "" number of deaths.the israel defense forces ( idf ) said on tuesday that troops were operating in a “ very targeted ” way against hamas’s remaining battalions in rafah , from which more than one million palestinians have fled over the past three weeks.the us government also said it did not believe “ a major ground operation ” was under way , which could trigger a change in its policy on military aid to israel.israel has insisted that it must take rafah to achieve victory in the war triggered by hamas’s unprecedented attack on the country on 7 october , during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.at least 36,170 people have been killed across gaza since the start of the conflict , according to the hamas-run health ministry . mr hanegbi - seen as a close confidant of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu - told kan that he was expecting another seven months of conflict "" in order to fortify our achievement and what we define as the destruction of the governmental and military capabilities of hamas and [ palestinian ] islamic jihad "" . that suggestion will worry many in israel and outside.there has been growing international pressure on israeli leaders to outline a full strategy to end the fighting and a convincing post-war vision for the palestinian territory.us secretary of state antony blinken later said it was imperative that israel formulate a post-war plan as soon as possible if it wanted to ensure hamas's lasting defeat . “ in the absence of a plan for the day after , there won't be a day after , ” he told reporters on a visit to moldova.in his interview , mr hanegbi also suggested that israel would soon take full control of the philadelphi corridor - a buffer zone , only about 100m ( 330ft ) deep in parts , which runs along the gaza side of the 13km ( 8-mile ) border with egypt . "" inside gaza , the idf is now in control of 75 % of the philadelphi corridor and i believe it will be in control of it all with time , ” he said.the plan , he added , was to work with the egyptians to “ ensure weapon smuggling is prevented ” . egypt has denied weapons are still being smuggled under the border . but the idf said on tuesday that it was demolishing tunnels that led to the sinai peninsula.residents have said that troops have seized about 9km of the philadelphi corridor , including the rafah border crossing , since the start of the ground operation in rafah on 6 may.the troops have also gradually pushed into built-up neighbourhoods of rafah city from the east and south , and reportedly reached the central al-awda roundabout on tuesday.on wednesday , residents told reuters news agency that tanks advanced into western tal al-sultan and central yibna and shaboura areas before pulling back towards positions on the border.the idf also announced that three israeli soldiers were killed in combat in rafah on tuesday.sam rose of the un agency for palestinian refugees ( unrwa ) , who is in western rafah , told the bbc that “ most people are now packing up and leaving ” . “ i was on the road this morning and so were many , many others . it seems that even though the operation , the israeli troops , haven't reached this far west of rafah yet , people have taken the signs . . . that it's time for them to leave , ” he said . “ a lot of anxiety , a lot of fear in the air . the rafah chapter of this conflict , which we hoped wouldn't be upon us , is now under way . "" meanwhile , gaza’s hamas-run health ministry warned the israeli bombardment of rafah was making it increasingly difficult for patients and health teams to reach the emirati maternity hospital in tal al-sultan.it came a day after the who said the hospital was barely functional and could no longer accept patients . “ if the incursion would continue , we would lose that last hospital in rafah , ” dr rik peeperkorn , the agency’s representative for gaza and the occupied west bank , warned in an interview with reuters and afp news agencies in geneva.with the european gaza hospital in the city of khan younis inaccessible because of israeli evacuation orders and fighting on the ground , the estimated 1.9 million people in southern gaza would be left “ dependent on a string of field hospitals along the coast ” , he said.dr peeperkorn said there was a contingency plan to refer patients to al-aqsa hospital in the central town of deir al-balah and to restore services to two other hospitals in khan younis which were raided by israeli forces . but , he added , if there was a “ full incursion ” , the plan would “ not prevent what we expect [ to be ] substantial additional mortality and morbidity ” . all the field hospitals still functioning in the rafah area are overwhelmed by casualties and undersupplied , according to the who.the palestine red crescent society ( prcs ) said on wednesday that it had evacuated the al-quds field hospital in al-mawasi , a coastal area just to the north-west of rafah . “ this action was taken due to the increased threat level from the israeli occupation , continued artillery and air bombardments in its vicinity , and the complete evacuation of residents from the surrounding area , ” a statement explained.on tuesday , gaza’s health ministry said six other medical facilities in rafah - al-najjar hospital , the kuwaiti specialist hospital , the two rafah field hospitals , the indonesian field hospital , and the abu al-walid central clinic - had been forced out of service.al-najjar hospital , rafah’s largest , was evacuated at the start of the israeli operation , while the medical aid for palestinians ( map ) said the smaller kuwaiti hospital closed “ after an israeli tank attack outside the hospital killed two medical staff ” on monday . separately , who spokeswoman dr margaret harris said the casualties from an israeli air strike and resulting fire at a camp for displaced people in the tal al-sultan on sunday had “ absolutely overwhelmed ” field hospitals in southern gaza.the health ministry said at least 45 people were killed in the incident . hundreds more were treated for severe burns , fractures and shrapnel wounds.idf spokesman rear adm hagari said on tuesday that aircraft had targeted two senior hamas officials inside a structure that was away from any tents , using “ two munitions with small warheads ” . “ our munitions alone could not have ignited a fire of this size , ” he said , adding that the military was looking into the possibility that weapons stored by hamas nearby could have caused a secondary explosion.mr blinken said he was unable to verify us media reports that us-made gbu-39 guided bombs were used in the strike , which he described as "" horrific "" . on tuesday , palestinians accused israel of shelling tents at al-mawasi , where it had advised civilians in rafah to go for safety . but the idf said it “ did not strike in the humanitarian area in al-mawasi ” . a displaced man from zeitoun in northern gaza , who asked not to be named , told bbc arabic’s gaza today programme that 18 members of his family were among the 21 reported killed . “ i was in the company of one of my relatives , whom i left for a while and went to perform my prayers , ” he said while trying to identify the bodies . “ when i returned , i found that he was martyred . ” “ i don't know why all this is happening to us ? we are human beings of flesh and blood . . . eighteen innocent people lost their lives in seconds . ” last week , the international court of justice ( icj ) ordered israel to “ immediately halt its military offensive , and any other action in the rafah governorate , which may inflict on the palestinian group in gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ” .",biden sets out new israeli proposal to end conflict in gaza - bbc news

2024-05-30T15:43:27.412Z,BBC,"an ai-generated image depicting tent camps for displaced palestinians and a slogan that reads all eyes on rafah is sweeping social media.the post has been shared more than 47 million times by instagram users including celebrities like dua lipa , lewis hamilton and gigi and bella hadid.the image and the slogan went viral after an israeli air strike and resulting fire at a camp for displaced palestinians in the southern gaza city of rafah earlier this week . the hamas-run health ministry said at least 45 people were killed and hundreds more wounded in the incident . israel said it had targeted two hamas commanders , and that the deadly fire was possibly caused by a secondary explosion.there has been widespread international condemnation of the israeli strike , which israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu called a “ tragic mishap ” . following the incident , the image went viral after a young man in malaysia posted it on his social media account , bbc arabic discovered.so how did this image come about ? the deadly incident earlier this week in rafah led to people posting clips of richard peeperkorn , a representative of the world health organization in the occupied palestinian territories , speaking in february.he told journalists at the time that “ all eyes are on rafah "" , warning against israeli forces attacking the city . speaking via an online call to journalists at the un's headquarters in geneva , mr peeperkorn said he feared "" unimaginable disaster "" if the israeli army made a large-scale incursion into the city , which it was threatening to invade.officials and activists have been repeating mr peeperkorn's phrase since then to express their concern and opposition to israel's military operation in rafah , which began three weeks ago . in the months that followed the first use of the phrase , all eyes on rafah slogans appeared at rallies around the world and on social media.but in the last two days , the ai-generated image featuring the slogan has proliferated on social media sites , with more than 47 million shares according to an instagram count on thursday afternoon.other celebrities who have shared the image and the slogan include american actor mark ruffalo , indian actress priyanka chopra and syrian actress kinda alloush . experts who spoke to the bbc say there are a number of factors that explain why the all eyes on rafah message has gone viral in such a short amount of time.among them are the ai-generated nature of the image , the simplicity of the slogan , the ease at which instagram users can share the post in just a couple of clicks , and its uptake by celebrities.but according to anastasia kavada , who runs an ma course on media , campaigning and social change at the university of westminster , the most important factor is the timing and political context of the post.she explains that it has gone viral at a time when many feel "" outraged "" at the news of the strike on the camp in rafah.this view is echoed by maher nammari , an e-marketing and artificial intelligence consultant , who emphasises the importance of the nature of the incident itself and the online interaction that followed . "" sunday's attack in rafah has caused widespread sadness "" , he told bbc arabic . what makes it more shareable still , however , is the ai-generated image in the post itself , experts say.the image - depicting a vast desert and a tent camp with the text all eyes on rafah on it - does not show a real place or the city of rafah.notably absent are pictures of dead bodies , blood , shots of real people , names or distressing scenes.this has led to criticism from some quarters.dr paul reilly , a senior lecturer in communications , media and democracy at the university of glasgow , says that some activists will feel concerned that the image does not show the true extent of what's really happening on the ground , pointing to material posted on social media by journalists in gaza which has not gained such viral prominence.reacting to the criticism , the malaysian artist who created the image - known by his username shahv4012 - wrote in an instagram story quoted by time magazine : “ there are people who are not satisfied with the picture and template , i apologize if i have made a mistake on all of you . "" but he added : “ whatever [ you do ] , don’t look down on the rafah issue now , spread it so that they are shaken and afraid of the spread of all of us . ” but while the image depicts a somewhat "" sanitised "" version of what is going on in rafah , dr reilly says that could be an advantage from a digital activist's perspective in terms of its share-ability.he explains that this is because the image does not contain graphic content that could lead to its removal from instagram for infringing its terms of use guidelines , while also increasing awareness of the issue that activists seek to bring attention to . tools developed by instagram have also contributed to taking the post viral.when "" shahv4012 "" published the picture , he used the “ add yours ” feature , launched by instagram in 2021 , which allows other users to re-share the photo with just a couple of clicks.people can also add their own captions and tags to the posts , making them easy to customise and share.mr nammari says that the use of such a feature in political or social campaigns is a recent development . “ in most cases , anyone who starts using this feature for political reasons aims to contribute to launching large-scale campaigns , because the [ post ] snowballs [ in popularity ] , "" he says . a smaller counter-campaign has been launched on social media in response to the all eyes on rafah message.an image , also created using ai , features the words : "" where were your eyes on october 7 ? "" referring to the hamas attacks on southern israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others taken hostage.the image , reportedly designed by israeli instagram user benjamin jamon , features a gunman standing in front of a baby taken captive in gaza.the image was shared about half a million times before the image was removed from some accounts and mr jamon's instagram account was banned , according to israeli media.the image later reappeared , with instagram's parent company meta saying : "" this image does not violate our policies "" and that it was "" working to understand a technical issue that led to some instances "" of it being "" mistakenly removed .

2024-05-30T16:33:34.268Z,BBC,"the edinburgh international book festival has ended its 20-year funding partnership with sponsors baillie gifford after pressure from climate change protesters.the move follows a similar decision by the hay festival in wales last week.the investment company , which is based in edinburgh , has been a major sponsor of uk arts events but has come under scrutiny for its investments in fossil fuels.book festival chairman allan little said they could nor deliver a safe and sustainable festival in august with the constant threat of disruption from activists . the protests began when more than 50 authors called on the festival to end its deal with baillie gifford in 2023 , after climate change activist greta thunberg cancelled an appearance at the event.the then festival director , nick barley , warned the organisation would not have enough money to operate without private sponsorship.in a statement released on thursday , baillie gifford's nick thomas said : “ the activists ’ anonymous campaign of coercion and misinformation has put intolerable pressure on authors and the festival community . "" we step back with the hope that the festival will thrive this year and into the future . "" we hold the activists squarely responsible for the inhibiting effect their action will have on funding for the arts in this country . "" pressure has mounted on the organisers in recent weeks after the protest group fossil free books turned its attention to the long-running hay festival.the group attacked the festival for its links with the investment firm , which it says has links to fossil fuel firms and israel.fossil free books and its supporters have made the israel-hamas war a campaigning issue alongside climate change.artists including charlotte church and nish kumar pulled out of appearing at hay last week in protest at the deal between the festival and baillie gifford.more than 700 publishers and writers including writers george monbiot , max porter and michael rosen have signed an open letter calling on festivals to end their links with baillie gifford . mr little said : “ our team cannot be expected to deliver a safe and sustainable festival this august under the constant threat of disruption from activists . this was a pragmatic response to that reality . “ funding for the arts is now in a perilous position and we should all be clear that without the support of our partners and donors , the future of festivals like ours – and all of the benefits these events bring to authors and readers alike – is in jeopardy . "" mr little said the festival was a charity and an "" important platform "" which allows people of all views to debate . "" book festivals around the world are forums in which rigorous , intelligent debate can take place . our festival should be a place where progressive and nuanced discussion can happen in a safe and respectful space , "" he said.the festival's chief executive , jenny niven , said the mutual decision to end the partnership was a source of great regret . “ the pressure on our team has simply become intolerable . we have a major global festival starting in 10 weeks ’ time and we need to focus all of our efforts and energy on delivering a safe and successful event for our audiences , "" she said . “ undermining the long-term future of charitable organisations such as book festivals is not the right way to bring about change .

"" the assertion that we have significant amounts of money in the occupied palestinian territories is offensively misleading . baillie gifford is a large investor in several multinational technology companies , including amazon , nvidia , and meta , "" he said . "" demanding divestment from these global companies , used by millions of people around the world , is unreasonable and serves no purpose . much as it would be unreasonable to demand authors boycott instagram or stop selling books on amazon . “ nor is baillie gifford a significant fossil fuel investor . only 2 % of our clients ’ money is invested in companies with some business related to fossil fuels . we invest far more in companies helping drive the transition to clean energy . "" fossil free books said they welcomed the news that the book festival had "" dropped "" baillie gifford as a sponsor.a statement said : "" our primary demand has always been for baillie gifford to divest , and for festivals to use their relationships with baillie gifford to call on the firm to divest . "" as bombs continue to fall on palestinians in gaza , we hope this sends a clear message : we are united in our solidarity for palestinians .

"" we love our literary festivals dearly , and it is a privilege to share work with readers , but this cannot come at the expense of the human rights of palestinians and communities harmed by fossil fuel companies . "" the group added that it has not coerced authors into supporting its aims and said it would be meeting jenny niven from the edinburgh international book festival on friday . sponsors like baillie gifford are rare in the arts world . they are known for giving a lot and place few - if any - restrictions on funding.but now , one by one the uk’s leading literary festivals are turning down baillie gifford's money , under pressure from activists and authors who say the investment firm has links to israel and fossil fuels which make it unacceptable.baillie gifford disputes the figures used in the fossil free books campaign . the company says only two per cent of their clients ' investments relate to fossil fuels and any suggestion they have significant sums in occupied palestinian territories is “ offensively misleading ” . but having persuaded the hay festival to drop its sponsorship , fossil free books have now done the same in edinburgh.the people who run the edinburgh book festival say this is the only practical way to ensure the event happens at all , after threats of disruption and boycott.a charitable organisation has been forced to turn down resources in the most precarious of times . the worry must be that other sponsors may also shy away , leaving the festival in jeopardy.and for what ? baillie gifford will continue to invest , and their philanthropy will go elsewhere.meanwhile , the complex issues and discussions for which this festival is famed may not have a platform at all .",jim henderson's funeral takes place in truro cathedral

"" i welcome [ president ] biden’s initiative [ and ] encourage all parties to seize this opportunity for a ceasefire , release of all hostages , guaranteed unhindered humanitarian access [ and ] ultimately a durable peace in the middle east , "" he added.in his speech , mr biden acknowledged that negotiations between phases one and two would be difficult . as recently as a few days ago , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu was letting it be known that he was implacably opposed to agreeing to end the war as part of a ceasefire deal - making mr biden's reference to the war's end particularly significant . while the plan includes many of the details from previous , ultimately failed rounds of talks , the us calls for a permanent ceasefire appear to be a significant concession designed to try and draw hamas back to negotiations on terms they have already said they would agree to . a permanent ceasefire has been one of the group's key demands . the third phase of the proposal would see the final remains of any deceased israeli hostages returned , as well as a "" major reconstruction plan "" with us and international assistance to rebuild homes , schools and hospitals . in his remarks , mr biden acknowledged that some israelis - including officials within israel's government - would likely be opposed to the proposal . "" i've urged the leadership in israel to stand behind this deal , "" he said . "" regardless of whatever [ political ] pressure comes . "" the us president also directly addressed the israeli people , telling them that "" we can't lose this moment "" . notably , mr biden said that hamas has now been degraded to the extent that it can no longer repeat an attack such as that which its fighters conducted on 7 october - a likely signal to the israelis that washington sees the war as done . in a statement , prime minister netanyahu insisted that the war would not end until its objectives were achieved , including the return of all hostages and the elimination of hamas ' military and governing capabilities . he said the latest plan would allow israel to uphold these principles.hamas , for its part , said that it views the proposal "" positively "" because of its call for a permanent ceasefire , the withdrawal of israeli forces from gaza , reconstruction and the exchange of prisoners . the group said it was ready to "" deal positively and constructively "" with any proposal centred on a permanent ceasefire , provided that israel "" declares its explicit commitment to that "" . another palestinian official familiar with the negotiations who has seen the new israeli proposal said that the document did not include a guarantee that the war will end , nor that idf troops would withdraw from gaza completely . the proposal has been transmitted to hamas through mediators based in qatar.meanwhile , us secretary of state antony blinken called his counterparts in jordan , saudi arabia and turkey to try to build a wider support for the proposal.mr blinken "" emphasized that hamas should accept the deal and that every country with a relationship with hamas should press it to do so without delay , "" state department spokesman matthew miller said on friday night . faced with mounting civilian casualties in gaza , president biden has faced growing domestic criticism over the level of us support for israel , and calls to do more to encourage the warring sides to negotiate . earlier this week , however , the white house said that it does not believe that israeli operations in rafah amount to a "" major ground operation "" that could cross a red line and trigger a possible change in us policy . the statement came after an israeli air strike and resulting fire killed at least 45 palestinians on sunday . in a separate announcement on friday , us lawmakers from both sides of the political spectrum formally invited mr netanyahu to address congress in washington . it is unclear when the address would take place . more than 36,000 have been killed across gaza since the start of the conflict , according to the hamas-run health ministry . the war began in october when hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented attack on israel , killing about 1,200 people and taking 252 back to gaza as hostages .",israel gaza war : icc prosecutor seeks arrest warrants for netanyahu and hamas leaders

2024-06-03T14:51:01.122Z,BBC,"for the leaders of both hamas and israel , ending the war in gaza has become a deadly game of survival.the terms on which the war finally ends could largely determine their political future and their grip on power . for hamas leader yahya sinwar , even his physical survival.it’s partly why previous negotiations have failed . it’s also why the question of how to permanently end the fighting has been put off to the last stages of the plan outlined by us president joe biden on friday.that transition between talks on a limited hostage-for-prisoner deal to discussions about a permanent ceasefire would , mr biden acknowledged , be “ difficult ” . but it’s also where the success or failure of this latest deal is likely to hinge.the us says it has submitted a draft resolution to the un security council supporting the ceasefire plan outlined by president biden . the three-phase plan involves an end to the conflict , the release of the hostages and reconstruction of the palestinian territory.israel’s prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , has strong domestic reasons for wanting to take this deal step by step.phase one , as outlined by mr biden , would see the release of dozens of hostages , both living and dead . that would be widely welcomed in a country where the failure to free all those held by hamas is , for many , a glaring moral stain on mr netanyahu's management of the war.but hamas is unlikely to give up its most politically sensitive hostages – women , wounded , elderly – without some kind of guarantee that israel won’t simply restart the war once they’re home.israel confirms deaths of four more hostages in gazaleaks , quoted by israeli media on monday morning , suggested that benjamin netanyahu has told parliamentary colleagues that israel would be able to keep its options open.that option , to resume fighting – until hamas is “ eliminated ” – is , some believe , the least mr netanyahu’s far-right coalition partners will demand.without their support , he faces the prospect of early elections and the continuation of a corruption trial.mr netanyahu needs to keep his long-term options open , to stand a chance of winning their support for any initial hostage deal . hamas leaders , on the other hand , are likely to want permanent ceasefire guarantees upfront.previous deals have collapsed into this chasm . bridging it now will depend on how much room for manoeuvre mr netanyahu has with his hard-right government allies to find alternatives to the “ elimination ” of hamas – and how far hamas leaders are prepared to consider them . mr netanyahu talked over the weekend about the destruction of hamas’s “ military and governing capabilities ” and ensuring that the group no longer posed a threat to israel.few dispute that hamas has suffered major losses to its military infrastructure – and even , some say , to its public support within gaza and its control of the streets.but there’s no sign that israel has killed or captured its top leaders yahya sinwar and mohammed deif , and leaving them free in gaza to celebrate the withdrawal of israeli forces would spell political disaster for israel’s embattled prime minister.on monday a us state department spokesman said that although hamas's capabilities had "" steadily degraded "" in recent months , it remained a threat and the us did not believe the group could be eliminated militarily.meanwhile the white house said mr biden had "" confirmed israel’s readiness to move forward with the terms that have now been offered to hamas "" and said the palestinian group was now the only obstacle to a deal.separately , military spokesman rear admiral daniel hagari said the israeli military would be able to ensure israel's security in the event of any truce agreed by the government.however yanir cozin , diplomatic correspondent with israel’s military radio station , glz , believes that mr netanyahu won’t end the war until he can frame it as a success . “ a deal that leaves hamas is a big failure , ” he said . “ eight months on , when you haven’t achieved any of the war goals – not finishing hamas , bringing all the hostages back , or securing the borders – then he doesn’t want to end the war . but he also understands that he cannot leave it until the next israeli election in 2026 . ” “ if he can say , ‘ we exiled yahya sinwar and mohammed deif , they’re not living in gaza ’ – and if the people living close to gaza and the northern border can go back – i think he can keep his government together . but it’s a lot of ‘ ifs ’ . ” hamas is very unlikely to agree to the exile or surrender of its top figures . but there are clear splits emerging between hamas leaders inside and outside gaza.former israeli prime minister ehud barak , who has also served as defence minister , told israeli radio on monday that president biden had announced the deal “ after seeing that netanyahu only moves ahead when he’s certain that sinwar will refuse ” . “ how do you think sinwar will react when he tends to agree and then he’s told : but be quick , because we still have to kill you after you return all the hostages , ” he said.in the meantime , tens of thousands of israelis displaced after the hamas attacks on 7 october are watching their prime minister’s next move.among them is yarin sultan , a 31-year-old mother of three who ran from her home in sderot on gaza’s border the morning after the hamas attacks . she says she won’t go home until yahya sinwar and mohammed deif are no longer free . “ this ceasefire will kill us , ” she told the bbc . “ we will free the hostages , but a few years from now you will be the next hostages , you will be the next people who get murdered , the women that are raped – all this will happen

who asked not to be named - also said he had seen injured and dead people “ lying on the ground ” and that essential services and goods were not available . “ there is no electricity or water . there are no clinics or medicines , ” he added . “ wells have been destroyed , shops and supermarkets demolished , and there is a shortage of food . ” the town of jabalia and its decades-old urban refugee camp - the largest in gaza , with more than 110,000 registered residents - witnessed weeks of devastating bombardment and fighting after the start of the war between israel and hamas in october.the israel defense forces ( idf ) said troops had secured control over the camp at the end of december after a series of operations in which it said “ many terrorists ” were killed.it subsequently scaled down combat operations across northern gaza , declaring that hamas’s local battalions had been dismantled . but that left a power vacuum in which the group was able to rebuild.on 12 may , the idf said troops were going back into jabalia for an operation "" based on intelligence information regarding attempts by hamas to reassemble its terrorist infrastructure and operatives in the area "" . over the next three weeks , battles raged as tanks and troops advanced into the refugee camp under the cover of intense air and artillery strikes . one military official described the fighting as "" perhaps the fiercest "" they had seen over the past seven months.on friday , the idf announced that troops had completed their mission , having “ eliminated hundreds of terrorists in intense combat and close-quarters encounters ” and destroyed dozens of “ terrorist infrastructure and combat compounds ” . the troops also located and destroyed more than 10km ( six miles ) of an underground tunnel network and retrieved the bodies of seven israelis taken hostage by hamas in october , it said . displaced families were soon pictured walking back to the camp along streets lined by destroyed buildings , carrying what remained of their belongings.a spokesman for gaza’s hamas-run civil defence force , mahmoud bassal , said on friday that its rescue teams had found dozens of bodies across jabalia camp - mostly women and children - including 30 members of one family.on sunday , the director of the kamal adwan hospital in the neighbouring town of beit lahia , dr husam abu safiyeh , told al araby tv that 120 bodies had been recovered from jabalia and the surrounding area , and that many more were believed to be buried under rubble.the identities of the dead were not yet clear . but the idf’s arabic spokesman , lt col avichay adraee , played down such reports on friday , insisting on x that they were members of hamas and other armed groups . mr bassal also said israeli forces had destroyed most of the homes in the camp , as well as its central market and almost all of its infrastructure . he added that the fifth floor of al-awda hospital in jabalia had been destroyed along with the main electrical generators at kamal adwan.the head of the municipal emergency committee for north gaza , naji sarhan , declared jabalia town , jabalia camp , beit lahia and nearby beit hanoun as “ disaster zones ” on sunday , estimating that 50,000 housing units had been destroyed there , according to a un situation report . he appealed to the international community for immediate shelter assistance and support in repairing water wells and other critical infrastructure.the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa , meanwhile said it had received “ horrific reports ” from jabalia camp , where it provides services.they included displaced people , including children , reportedly being killed and injured while sheltering in an unrwa-run school that was besieged by israeli tanks , according to a post on x , formerly twitter . there were also reports of unrwa offices being destroyed by air strikes and bulldozed by israeli forces , it added.unrwa chief philippe lazzarini said thousands of people from the camp now had “ no choice but to live amid the rubble and in destroyed unrwa facilities ” . one of the returnees told bbc arabic’s gaza lifeline programme that he and his seven-year-old son had seen “ the bodies of martyrs scattered everywhere in the streets ” on saturday . “ east jabalia has been subjected to an unprecedented devastation , ” diab abu salama said . “ all the stores in jabalia have been destroyed , as well as the homes surrounding them . ” “ there is no doubt that the goal of the occupation [ israel ] in displacing people and destroying their homes and shops is to force them to leave this country , ” he claimed , before adding : “ but we will remain steadfast . ” musaed zaqzouq , meanwhile , described how he found only rubble where his home had stood three weeks ago . “ the scene was very horrible , ” he said . “ the family home was completely destroyed , and so was the neighbourhood in which i lived . ” “ water pipes were destroyed . . . sewage channels were damaged , ” he added . “ there is no longer one suitable place for habitation . ” a woman , who asked not to be named , said the level of devastation was such that “ we walk in the streets as if we are seeing them for the first time ” . she also urged the international community to take action to help palestinians in jabalia and elsewhere in gaza . “ what is the reason for all this mass destruction ? ” she asked . “ please , hurry and come to us to see how much we are tormented . ” israel launched a military campaign in gaza to destroy hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern israel on 7 october , during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.at least 36,470 people have been killed in gaza since then , according to the hamas-run health ministry .",fifa to make legal assessment after palestine federation calls for israel suspension -

"" without the support of baillie gifford we would not have been able to mount such a vibrant and varied children’s festival - where adults go free - and do all that we do with schools in the borders .

"" the aim has always been - and will continue to be - to call upon baillie gifford to divest , "" he said . "" we appreciate them listening to writers and book workers , "" he said . "" the aim has never been to target festivals - it is about using these festivals ' very unique relationship with this investor . "" he said he appreciated that their tactics might not be welcome but said there was a long history of such protests being used to draw attention to campaigns.he said book festivals did not have to rely on corporate sponsorship and hoped it could lead to the pursuit of better public funding . the wigtown book festival , which will be held in neighbouring dumfries and galloway later in the year , also receives support from baillie gifford.director adrian turpin said the festival was in “ dialogue ” with the company over their relationship.however , he said he was confident that sponsorship the festival received conformed to "" transparent ethical standards "" . he said : "" it is not our role to make a case for them , but we encourage everyone to look at the facts and the misrepresentations that have been made , both regarding their climate-related and israel-related investments .

2024-06-04T13:30:00.000Z,BBC,"four goals from martha thomas guided unbeaten scotland to a comprehensive victory over israel that maintains their lead at the top of group b2 in euro 2025 qualifying . the tottenham hotspur striker scored two either side of half-time in scotland's second meeting with israel in four days behind closed doors as pedro martinez losa's side secured a play-off spot.thomas slotted the opener in budapest , hungary , after another impressive start from the scots before heading in a second on the end of an outstanding team move.her team-mates could have chipped in with a few in between , but the striker settled any nerves with a third following good movement and added a fourth with her head . once the 28-year-old was substituted , chelsea cornet took the reins and emphatically netted her first international goal with a smashed effort late on.serbia's impressive 4-0 away to slovakia later in the evening means they remain tied with the scots on points but behind on goal difference . friday nightâ_x0080__x0099_s first-half performance generated heaps of praise due to the forward-thinking play , dominance in the final third and , crucially , goals , which have been a bit sparse for scotland of late.there was hope that could be replicated in hungary and , after a slightly sticky start , scotland met expectations.thomas , who scored the fourth from the spot four days ago , eventually slotted home after breaking away from the defence , but the visitors arguably should have been out of sight already.on her 50th appearance , sophie howardâ_x0080__x0099_s header was cleared off the line , while claire emslie and kirsty hanson â_x0080__x0093_ who both scored on friday â_x0080__x0093_ smacked the woodwork and emslie was also denied by fortuna rubinâ_x0080__x0099_s strong foot.the scots didnâ_x0080__x0099_t let up and a sharp second seemed to be scored after a bit of a stramash in the six-yard-box . the ball appeared to be in , but the officials were unmoved and , with no goalline technology , play continued.the second did come , through thomas of course , and while she got the final nod , it was all about the well-worked build-up play from captain rachel corsieâ_x0080__x0099_s defence-splitting pass to lisa evansâ_x0080__x0099_ pinpoint cross.thomas squandered a header , but her first international hat-trick was soon complete , courtesy of her knee . and why stop at three ? once again , her height proved too difficult to deal with and she rose for a fourth on her best afternoon in a scotland shirt . chances came and went for emslie and cornet too , but the rangers midfielder finally found her opportunity to seal an impressive win on the road for the scots . the double-header against israel sandwiched in the middle of the fixture list was always viewed as a must-win pair of games , with the hope of a good few goals too.scotland completed the task at hand with relative ease , barring a few scares on friday which were handled well by lee gibson in goal.martinez losaâ_x0080__x0099_s side looked back to their old selves . the confidence was no doubt knocked by the poor nations league campaign and the pinatar cup was not as successful on the pitch as some would have hoped.however , going undefeated in the first four group b2 games has allowed the scots to smile again and play some lovely stuff , despite missing key operators.across both games , the front three of hanson , thomas and emslie have particularly impressed , and their link-up play has been joyous . they seem settled and connected , which will be key if next summerâ_x0080__x0099_s euros are eventually reached.with erin cuthbert rested , captain corsie shifted into the midfield and made the position look her own . her natural instinct to sit deep allowed sam kerr to roam forward and influence the top end of the pitch alongside cornet . scotland head coach pedro martinez losa : "" we are very happy with the performance , very proud of the team . it was a proper team performance with some circumstances to deal with throughout the game but that's what a team is there for . "" we are more proactive in the final third and martha is a player who can be very effective from crosses and that's something we managed to do . "" scotland have two games left in the group , away to slovakia on 12 july ( 18:00 bst ) before ending the campaign by hosting serbia four days later ( 18:00 ) .","what icc arrest warrants mean for israel , benjamin netanyahu and hamas"
2024-06-04T16:25:12.306Z,BBC,"the us house of representatives has voted to pass legislation that would sanction the international criminal court ( icc ) after its prosecutor applied for arrest warrants against israeli officials.the move comes after the hague-based court's prosecutor said israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and israeli defence minister yoav gallant should be arrested on charges relating to the war in gaza.the prosecutor is also seeking warrants for three leaders of hamas.the bill , proposed by pro-israel republicans , targets icc officials involved in the case by blocking their entry to the us.on tuesday , it passed with a majority of republican support by a vote of 247-155 . two republicans voted "" present "" and 42 pro-israel democrats crossed the aisle to back the legislation.though the bill passed in the house , it is not expected to become law . the legislation will likely be ignored by democrats who control the us senate , where it would have to pass before it could be signed into law by the president.but president joe biden has also indicated that he "" strongly opposes "" the bill and the administration has said it does not support the sanctions . if it did become law , however , the legislation would also revoke any us visas held by icc officials and restrict them from making property transactions in the us.some senate democrats , like john fetterman of pennsylvania , an outspoken supporter of israel , have indicated they would support legislation sanctioning the court . “ i really would like to sanction the icc for that . that was trash , ” fetterman said of the arrest warrants . congressman chip roy , a texas republican who introduced the legislation in the house , titled the illegitimate court counteraction act , has called the icc “ a massive threat to us sovereignty ” . the democrats who opposed the measure largely support israel , but have criticised mr netanyahu's conservative government . some democratic opponents said it risked forcing the us to sanction ally nations that support the icc.when the measure cleared the house rules committee on monday , jim mcgovern , a massachusetts democrat , said : “ this bill makes a mockery of the rules-based international order that america helped build . ” the bill's passage comes shortly after mr netanyahu was invited by us lawmakers to deliver a speech to congress this summer , although the date of his speech has not been finalised.last month , icc chief prosecutor karim khan said he had "" reasonable grounds "" to believe that mr netanyahu and mr gallant , as well as hamas’s gaza leader yahya sinwar , military chief mohammed deif and political leader ismail haniyeh , bore "" criminal responsibility "" for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war in gaza.it marked the first time the icc has targeted the top leader of a close us ally . "" the icc has to be punished for this action , "" republican speaker of the house mike johnson said on tuesday . "" we cannot allow this to stand . "" "" if the icc was allowed to do this and go after the leaders of countries whose actions they disagree with , why would they not come after america ? "" israel’s government and hamas reacted with outrage to mr khan's announcement last month.mr netanyahu denounced the warrant applications against him and mr gallant as a “ moral outrage of historic proportions ” . mr gallant accused the prosecutor of drawing a “ despicable ” parallel between israel and hamas and attempting to deny his country’s right to self-defence.hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by israel , the us and other countries - demanded the cancellation of the warrant applications for its leaders and denounced what it called mr khan's attempts “ to equate the victim with the executioner "" . if the icc’s judges decide to issue the arrest warrants , it will be up to its 124 member states - including the uk and many other us allies - to decide whether or not to enforce them.the white house said in a statement on monday that while the icc prosecutor’s warrant applications for israeli leaders were "" outrageous "" , it did not support sanctioning the icc . "" there are more effective ways to defend israel , preserve us positions on the icc , and promote international justice and accountability , and the administration stands ready to work with the congress on those options , ” it said.created by a un treaty in 2002 , the icc investigates and brings to justice those responsible for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , intervening when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute.the us - like israel - is not a member of the icc and does not recognise its jurisdiction , but has backed its previous prosecutions and arrest warrants not related to israel and the palestinians.in 2020 under the trump administration , the us imposed sanctions on top icc officials , including mr khan’s predecessor , after the court began investigating alleged war crimes committed by the us and others in the afghan conflict.the ongoing conflict in gaza began when hamas gunmen attacked southern israel on 7 october , killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others hostage , according to israeli authorities.at least 36,470 people have since been killed in gaza during israel’s military campaign to destroy hamas , according to the hamas-run health ministry .",israel war : gaza israel angrily dismisses un court ruling

2024-06-04T19:14:45.194Z,BBC,"hezbollah rockets have sparked days of bushfires in northern israel , with swathes of forest reserve destroyed and 11 people hospitalised for smoke inhalation.patches of scorched earth start to appear half an hour out from the lebanon border , plumes of grey smoke mapping the route to either side across the hills.local residents in israel’s largely-deserted northern communities , have been battling scattered fires for several weeks . one member of a civil defence team said there had been 15-16 fires in the area since then . but high temperatures over the past few days have led to a sharp increase.firefighters on monday battled for 20 hours to put out fires around the town of kiryat shmona.the fires – which forest administrators say have so far burned through 3,500 acres of land – are fuelling fresh demands that israel’s government take steps to end the escalating conflict with hezbollah on its northern front.israel’s war cabinet was due to meet on tuesday evening to discuss the worsening security situation along its northern border . israel and hezbollah have been trading cross-border fire on a near daily basis since last october and recent weeks have seen an escalation in the intensity of attacks.residents of one kibbutz said the hezbollah rocket attacks were “ definitely ” linked to israel’s actions in gaza , and that since the israeli military's ground operation in the southern gaza city of rafah began , three or four rockets were flying over their houses every day.tens of thousands of residents , evacuated from the area after the hamas attacks on israel , are still waiting to return to their homes . but government deadlines to secure these areas keep slipping.many of these displaced residents see a ceasefire in gaza as the key to calming the situation in the north.but israel’s far-right security minister , itamar ben-gvir , visiting firefighters in the nearby town of kiryat shmona today , said the government’s response to hezbollah’s rockets should be war . “ no peace in lebanon while our land is being targeted , ” he said.herzl halevi , israel’s army chief of staff , also visiting the region , said the country was “ approaching the point where a decision will have to be made . ” the israel defence force , he said , was “ prepared and ready to move to an offensive . ” hezbollah’s deputy chief , sheikh naim qassem , told al-jazeera that the group was not seeking to widen the conflict with israel but that any israeli expansion of the war would be met “ with devastation ” . the government has been keen to contain this conflict on its northern border , aware that hezbollah is a better-trained and better-equipped enemy than hamas – and that fighting here would be a very different kind of war.but the fires have put this grinding forgotten conflict squarely on the front pages of national newspapers , and israel’s prime minister benjamin netanyahu is under fresh pressure to act.he and hamas leader yahya sinwar in gaza are already at the centre of delicate negotiations over a potential ceasefire and hostage exchange deal in gaza , which us president joe biden is pushing both sides to accept . gaza ceasefire plan turns into deadly game of survival","gaza war : spain , ireland and norway formally recognise palestinian state"
2024-06-05T05:41:13.978Z,BBC,"after israeli forces pulled out of gaza city’s vast al-shifa hospital complex on 1 april , following their second raid there , stunned palestinians who pored over the burnt-out ruins said it reeked of death.during the past eight months of war , hospitals have come under repeated attack , with israel claiming they are used as bases by hamas ; something the group denies . but events at al-shifa – once the biggest and best equipped medical facility in the gaza strip – have arguably been the most dramatic.the two-week surprise raid , launched after israel said hamas had regrouped at the site , was described by the israeli government as "" precise and surgical "" . its spokesman , avi hyman , asserted that it had set "" the gold standard of urban warfare "" . he said : “ we took out over 200 terrorists . we apprehended over 900 terrorists with not a single civilian casualty . ” with decaying bodies sticking out of the sand piled up by combat bulldozers in the courtyards of al-shifa , the claim that there had been no civilian casualties was immediately questioned.in recent weeks , four mass graves have been uncovered at the site , with palestinian search teams saying that several hundred bodies have been found . we have worked with a journalist in gaza to follow developments . “ we’ve extracted martyrs , many of whom are decomposed and completely unidentifiable , ” a palestinian civil defence worker , rami dababesh told us grimly on 8 may as he stood by a line of white plastic body bags at al-shifa , wearing a face mask and full protective gear . “ we’ve found corpses of women , children and individuals without heads as well as torn body parts , ” he added.the civil defence lacks forensic equipment and expertise , but its teams have been using photos and videos to document the remains . a director , dr mohamed mughir , told us there were suspicious finds ; describing how “ signs of field executions , binding marks , gunshot wounds to the head and torture marks on the limbs were observed on the bodies of some martyrs "" . the un security council has expressed “ deep concern ” at the discovery of mass graves at both al-shifa and nasser hospital in southern gaza . along with the us and the european union , it has called for an independent investigation into possible war crimes.the israel defense forces ( idf ) says that during its raids of the gaza hospitals , its soldiers exhumed bodies that palestinians had buried earlier as part of its search for the remains of some 250 hostages captured during the deadly hamas attacks on israel on 7 october . it maintains bodies were examined respectfully and those not belonging to israeli captives were returned to their place . however , at least some of the corpses found recently at al-shifa were those of patients who died during israel’s latest military action . a paramedic involved in the search said some had iv catheters still attached.on 15 april , the bbc met two men whose dead mothers were last seen being treated at the hospital . their bodies had just been recovered from a mass grave . “ i came running here when they told me of the grave , ” said mohammed al-khatib , who had spent days searching for his mother , khawla . “ by the grace of almighty god her body was found . ” walid fteima said his elderly mother , lina abu leila , was being treated for malnutrition and severe dehydration when she died . her body was decomposed , and he could only identify her from injuries she had from an israeli bombing last year . “ [ she ] had a toe amputated on each foot , ” he explained.after it began its operation at the hospital early on 18 march , the idf ordered thousands of civilians sheltering there and living in the vicinity to leave and head south . however , it said the hospital could continue to function . by the end of two weeks , only some 140 patients and medics reportedly remained . the local who representative , dr rik peeperkorn , says this group endured “ horrific conditions ” . after being repeatedly moved around the complex , he says , they “ actually ended up in the human resources building which was completely unfit for treatment "" . ultimately , he says , 20 patients died.several surviving patients – all wounded in previous israeli strikes – told us they were given only tiny quantities of food such as canned tuna . they said there were severe shortages of drinking water and medication . “ the bombing surrounded us 24/7 , ” said mohamed al-nadeem who is half paralysed . “ i am sick and unable to move . i was sleeping on the floor without blankets . ” “ there were no dressings or painkillers , ” said rafif doghmush , 15 , whose foot has been amputated.the idf has told journalists that no staff or patients died as a “ direct result ” of its action , but that some may have died of “ natural causes "" . during its raid , it said it helped patients by moving them out of harm’s way and that medical supplies and devices as well as food , water , and a generator were brought to the hospital.grainy drone footage shared by the idf after it launched its raid on 18 march showed palestinian gunmen apparently shooting at soldiers from inside al-shifa hospital . later , the gunmen were said to have barricaded themselves in wards and corridors , opening fire and throwing explosives.three israeli soldiers were confirmed to have been killed during the two-week long operation.the idf briefed journalists that its action at the hospital was taken based on “ concrete intelligence ” that hamas and palestinian islamic jihad had taken over parts of the site , suggesting their operatives had been using it to access basic supplies as well as power and the internet . while hamas denied using al-shifa as a base , its officials did not deny the presence of some members inside the complex , indicating that they may have been among displaced people sheltering there.israel has said that “ over 200 terrorists ” were killed in and around al-shifa , as well as the hundreds detained , but has only given some names.these include faiq al-mabhouh , described as head of operations in hamas ’ internal security service . the hamas-run government’s media office said he was a police commander who had been co-ordinating aid deliveries to northern gaza.others killed were identified as a senior hamas commander , raed thabet , said to have been head of recruitment and supply acquisition , and mahmoud zakzouk , said to have been deputy commander of the hamas rocket unit in gaza city . two other hamas operatives were named as fadi dweik and zakaria najib , said to have been involved in organising attacks in the occupied west bank.in april , the idf also released footage which it said was from the interrogation of tarek abu shaluf , spokesman for the political wing of islamic jihad . it said he had been captured at al-shifa.hamas and islamic jihad do not routinely confirm the names of low-level fighters killed by israeli military action , making it very difficult to estimate how many were killed at the hospital and in the vicinity . it is likely that a number were among the dead found in mass graves . despite the israeli claim that there was “ not a single civilian casualty ” from its raid , we have been given strong testimony that there were palestinian civilians killed by heavy israeli bombardment and intense shooting in the surrounding neighbourhood.the palestinian civil defence told us that hundreds of palestinians were still reported to be missing following the raid in march.there have repeatedly been conflicting narratives about what has happened in and around al-shifa.during its first controversial raid there , the israeli military raised expectations that israeli hostages might be found at the site . it also released a graphic depicting a vast underground tunnel network that it suggested was underneath the hospital , serving as a major hamas command and control centre.while the idf said it retrieved the bodies of two israeli hostages near to the hospital , it did not announce that it had found any within the complex . security camera footage that was recovered did show that at least two foreign captives were taken there on 7 october.the idf showed what it said was a fortified 55-metre tunnel on the hospital grounds . this fell short of its initial claims about the extent of hidden tunnels , although later reporting suggested the passage – which was blown up – had actually been longer and was most likely connected to a wider network under gaza city.when it returned to the site in march , the idf suggested its key discoveries were of a different nature , releasing pictures of cash , weapons , and ammunition it said it had found there along with hamas documents . al-shifa has been at the heart of a debate about whether hamas uses medical sites as a cover . israel has consistently claimed that the group hides its fighters and infrastructure behind the sick and wounded , which it suggests has rendered hospitals legitimate military targets.hamas denies misusing civilian sites and accuses israel of violating international humanitarian law by targeting hospitals.in april , when the un called for “ a clear , transparent and credible investigation ” of mass graves in gaza , its spokesman stephane dujarric told reporters that more journalists needed to be able to work safely in the territory to report on the facts . during the war , israel and egypt have denied free access to foreign media.mr dujarric also said : “ it’s important that all forensic evidence be well preserved . ” so far , that is proving to be a challenge.international forensic specialists have been unable to reach gaza to investigate what happened at al-shifa . that has left much of the focus locally on registering and identifying the dead where possible , and giving them proper burials.the disturbance of the mass grave sites , experts say , will ultimately make it much harder to uncover the truth about them.meanwhile , although al-shifa has been largely destroyed , there have been recent efforts to restart very limited medical services on site . these gained momentum as israel targeted other health facilities which it said were being used by hamas , particularly kamal adwan hospital in northern gaza.in late may , in a

” others have been more measured . war with hezbollah would be a much more difficult and dangerous conflict than the one israel is fighting in gaza.hezbollah’s deputy chief , sheikh naim qassem , told the al jazeera television station that the group was not seeking to widen the conflict but that any israeli expansion of the war would be met “ with devastation ” . before a meeting of the war cabinet to discuss the situation on tuesday night , the israeli military’s chief of staff , lt gen herzi halevi , said the country was “ approaching the point where a decision will have to be made ” . the armed forces , he said , were “ prepared and ready to move to an offensive ” . prime minister benjamin netanyahu , visiting troops and firefighters in the northern town of kiryat shmona on wednesday , said the government was prepared for “ a very strong action in the north . ” “ one way or another we will restore security to the north , ” he said.many believe a ceasefire in gaza would help cool the situation further north . “ gaza is the key , ” dean says . “ it needs to be dealt with , one way or the other . then hezbollah will stop , because they’re doing this in support of hamas . ” the northern conflict is closely linked to the war in gaza.for the past eight months , with the focus on gaza , israel’s leader has tried to keep this conflict contained.now he’s facing a glaring reminder of this other front : caught between the war he hasn’t finished in the south , and the war he doesn’t necessarily want to start .","ireland , norway and spain to recognise palestinian state"

"" i'm not aware of any civilian casualties and i'd be very , very cautious of accepting anything that hamas puts out , "" he added.he also said the idf had called off the attack twice in order to limit civilian casualties and accused hamas and palestinian islamic jihad of deliberately using un facilities as operational bases.mr thawabta rejected the idf’s claims , saying : “ the occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people . ” mr lazzarini said the school was hit “ without prior warning ” to his agency or the people sheltering there . “ claims that armed groups may have been inside the shelter are shocking . we are however unable to verify these claims , ” he added . “ attacking , targeting or using un buildings for military purposes are a blatant disregard of international humanitarian law . un staff , premises and operations must be protected at all times . ” mr lazzarini complained that more than 180 unrwa buildings had been hit since the war began despite their co-ordinates being shared with parties to the conflict , and that more than 450 displaced people had been killed as a result.at least 36,650 people have been killed in gaza since israel launched a military campaign in response to the 7 october attack , according to the territory's health ministry , whose figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants.medics also told afp and palestinian news agency wafa that another pre-dawn strike on thursday killed six people at a house in nuseirat camp.the idf meanwhile said troops had located underground tunnel shafts and weapons in eastern areas of bureij refugee camp - just west of nuseirat - and eastern deir al-balah , a day after it said they had taken "" operational control "" there.residents reported intense bombardment in the areas on wednesday , while médecins sans frontières said at least 70 bodies - the majority women and children - had been brought to al-aqsa hospital over the previous 24 hours.the idf also said on thursday that troops and aircraft had killed three suspects who had approached the gaza-israel border fence in the rafah area , and that an israeli soldier had been killed in battle in southern gaza . last month , there was global outrage after an israeli air strike , which the idf said targeted two senior hamas officials , and a resulting fire reportedly killed dozens of palestinians at a tented camp for displaced people near a unrwa logistics base in the southern city of rafah . the idf said the loss of life was “ tragic ” and that it was investigating the possibility that ammunition stored by hamas could have caused a secondary explosion.that incident prompted mediators to revive their efforts to broker a ceasefire and hostage release deal between israel and hamas.us president joe biden outlined what he described as an israeli proposal that had been presented to hamas.the first phase of the plan would last six weeks and include a temporary truce that would see the release of some of the hostages still being held in gaza in return for palestinians from israeli jails . the second phase would include a permanent cessation of hostilities.on thursday , the us , uk and 16 other countries with citizens among the hostages issued a joint statement calling on the leaders of israel and hamas “ to make whatever final compromises are necessary to close this deal and bring relief to the families of our hostages ” . hamas political leader ismail haniyeh said on wednesday that the group would deal "" seriously and positively "" with a proposal based on an end to the war and a full israeli withdrawal from gaza.israel's prime minister benjamin netanyahu has insisted he will not agree to a permanent ceasefire before hamas is defeated and the hostages are released . on wednesday , he declared the country was “ striving for total victory ” . additional reporting by george wright in london",gaza war : icj orders israel to stop rafah offensive

"" people are dying every single day . . . the vast majority according to reports are women and children . many of them are dying unnecessarily due to lack of medical care . children are dying due to malnutrition and dehydration , "" juliette touma , spokeswoman for the un agency for palestinian refugees unrwa , told bbc arabic . on 6 may israeli military spokesman avichay adraee instructed palestinians in eastern rafah to evacuate to an “ expanded humanitarian zone ” that stretches from the nearby al-mawasi area to the central town of deir al-balah and said they would find field hospitals , tents , food and other supplies.the israel defense forces ( idf ) then took control of the rafah border crossing with egypt , which lies to the south-east of rafah city , as it began what it described as a “ precise counterterrorism operation ” against hamas operatives and infrastructure in eastern rafah . the us had said it opposed a "" major ground operation "" in rafah.while the idf instructed people in eastern rafah to evacuate , central and western parts of the city were not covered by the evacuation orders.but palestinians in these parts of rafah have also fled their temporary structures as deadly bombardment in different areas around the city continued and troops advanced into central neighbourhoods.one israeli missile strike on 26 may set fire to a camp for displaced palestinians near tal al-sultan to the north-west of rafah , killing 45 people including many children , according to the hamas-run palestinian health ministry.the strike caused global outrage . the idf later said it had not expected such a fire to break out . recent satellite imagery of western and central rafah analysed by bbc arabic showed thousands of tents sheltering displaced people have disappeared in recent weeks.aerial pictures of western rafah from 1 june show areas that were densely populated have become deserted.similar images of tal al-sultan to the north-west of rafah , where a major urban refugee camp is located , show areas of land have been cleared of tents.on thursday the head of unrwa philippe lazzarini said all of his agency's 36 shelters in rafah were empty of people . in recent weeks , israeli troops have been gradually pushing into built-up neighbourhoods of rafah from the east and south.an armoured vehicle and troops were seen on 28 may in a video posted on social media at the central al-awda roundabout.satellite images from 1 june also show several armoured vehicles positioned near rafah.the satellite image taken on 1 june shows the destruction of al-abrar mosque as well as severe damage to nearby market buildings in central rafah.the idf has also declared control of much of the strategically important buffer zone along the gaza-egypt border known as the philadelphi corridor . the un and other aid agencies have been warning the assault on the city is having catastrophic consequences.mr lazzarini said unrwa had to stop health and other services in rafah and said his agency had only been able to pick up 450 trucks of supplies entering gaza over the past three weeks""this is nothing in the face of the needs , "" he said.world health organization chief dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said fighting had "" severely crippled "" healthcare provision in rafah where he said tens of thousands of vulnerable people were still present.he said the uae field hospital in rafah city was the "" only facility in the area providing health services "" but was "" increasingly difficult to reach due to hostilities "" . there was also only one fully functional field hospital in the al-mawasi area , he said.he called for the rafah crossing to be reopened saying its closure was making it harder to get supplies and staff into gaza.the rafah crossing in southern gaza , which had been the main entry point of aid entering via egypt , has been closed after israel took control of the palestinian side of the crossing in early may . the hamas-run health ministry also said the continued closure of the rafah crossing meant severely wounded palestinians could not be evacuated for potentially lifesaving treatment abroad . some 25,000 wounded palestinians needed treatment abroad , it said.israel says it is facilitating the entry of aid through the other point of entry in southern gaza , kerem shalom . on monday cogat , the israeli defence ministry body that coordinates humanitarian aid to gaza , insisted that the gaza side of kerem shalon was "" at full capacity "" , with "" the content of over 1,000 aid trucks waiting to be picked up by un aid agencies "" . however insecurity has meant the gaza side of the kerem shalom crossing has at times been too dangerous to access , the un has said.on tuesday the un humanitarian agency ocha said access constraints "" continue to undermine the safe delivery of life-saving humanitarian assistance throughout gaza "" , and conditions "" further deteriorated "" in may . rafah had a population of 250,000 people before the war began in october.that figure swelled to 1.4 million people in the following months , the un says , turning rafah into a vast refugee camp . in october , the idf told civilians in northern gaza including gaza city to move south of the wadi gaza riverbed . its subsequent assault on other areas including the city of khan younis displaced palestinians further south.the war was triggered by hamas’s unprecedented attack on 7 october , during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage.more than 36,000 people have been killed in gaza , the hamas-run health ministry there says.on 24 may , the international court of justice ( icj ) ordered israel to “ immediately halt its military offensive , and any other action in the rafah governorate , which may inflict on the palestinian group in gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part ” .",edinburgh book festival ends baillie gifford sponsorship
2024-06-06T15:32:35.676Z,BBC,"in a classroom-turned-bedroom at a un school in nuseirat refugee camp in central gaza , palestinian children clamber through rubble and blood-stained mattresses.just hours earlier , at least 35 people were killed and many more wounded at the site in an israeli military strike early in the morning , according to the head of the un agency for palestinian refugees , unrwa . “ i saw pieces of iron flying and everything falling down . what happened to us is unimaginable , ” said naim al-dadah from gaza city , one of hundreds of displaced people sheltering there.israel’s military says it carried out a “ precision , intelligence-based strike ” to target between 20 to 30 hamas and islamic jihad fighters who were using the school as a staging ground to plan and launch attacks.however , 14 children and nine women were among those killed , the hamas-run government media office says . earlier , medics reported similar numbers to a local journalist working with the bbc.during the war , israel has repeatedly accused hamas of hiding its operatives in schools , hospitals , and other buildings , using civilians as human shields – charges the armed group denies . “ all of the red lines have been crossed , ” said mr al-dadah , suggesting that being in a un institution had given his family no protection . he added : “ the world treats us with double standards . israel has violated all international laws . ” israel has faced growing diplomatic isolation over its conduct of the war , with cases against it before two international courts , but insists it has acted within the laws of armed conflict as it tries to counter what it sees as an existential threat from hamas.on a call with journalists , the israel defense forces ( idf ) spokesman lt col peter lerner said that some of the palestinian armed fighters based in the nuseirat school had been involved in the 7 october attacks , which killed about 1,200 people in southern israel and triggered the war in gaza . no evidence was immediately given.col lerner suggested that hamas and islamic jihad operatives would have “ felt relatively safe ” at the building , because it belonged to the un.the idf published a photo of the school with classrooms on the first and second floors marked to show the locations it said were targeted by warplanes.to an unusual extent in this case , the israeli military has stressed that it took steps to reduce the risk of harming civilians . “ we actually called off the strike twice , ” lt col lerner said.the overnight attack was the latest case of mass casualties among palestinians trying to find safety as israel expands its offensives in the gaza strip . some of those staying at the un school said that they came from northern gaza – but had heeded israeli military evacuation orders and headed south in the early stages of the war – only to be displaced in the past month from rafah , on the egyptian border.this week , the idf announced a new ground and air assault in central gaza , targeting what it said were hamas fighters who had regrouped there . its forces have repeatedly returned to parts of the palestinian territory which they previously withdrew from.in a courtyard of the un school , more than 20 corpses were lined up in body bags and blankets . a journalist working with the bbc filmed several women cradling the heads and hands of their dead sons . “ it was a very harsh night , ” says ibrahim lulu , a teenager who said his cousin , mohammed was killed . “ my brothers , friends and i were sitting together when suddenly there was an explosion . the mattress protected me because i was sitting against the wall . all the bodies were dismembered and torn . ” residents said the part of the school targeted was being used as a shelter for men and boys , with women and girls sleeping in a separate section . part of the school had previously been targeted by an israeli strike in mid-may with the idf then saying it was being used as a “ hamas war room ” . overnight , casualties were rushed from nuseirat to the al-aqsa martyrs ’ hospital in nearby deir al-balah . in recent days it has been struggling to treat hundreds of wounded people following intense israeli bombardment and shelling in the surrounded area.the hospital had earlier reported an electrical generator failure saying that this would make it harder to treat patients.on wednesday , medics from doctors without borders ( msf ) which is supporting the hospital described chaotic scenes there . it said that in the previous 24 hours , at least 70 dead people had been brought in , and more than 300 wounded , mostly women and children .",euro 2025 : scotland v israel to be played behind closed doors - bbc sport

2024-06-10T14:21:37.890Z,BBC,"the dramatic rescue of four israeli hostages in gaza amid efforts to try to get israel and hamas to agree to a ceasefire has raised questions over the impact it could have on reaching a deal , as mediated talks show no sign of a breakthrough.as images of the freed and smiling three men and one woman dominated tv bulletins and news websites , tens of thousands of people joined protests across israel on saturday , urging the government to strike an agreement with hamas for the release of those who are still being held . “ all of them , now ! ” the crowd chanted in tel aviv.hamas meanwhile has called the operation , which its health ministry said killed more than 270 palestinians , a “ massacre ” . being discussed is a three-stage plan announced by us president joe biden earlier this month , which he described as an israeli proposal . it would secure the release of the hostages and , crucially , pave the way for a permanent ceasefire in gaza.notably , the israeli prime minister , benjamin netanyahu , has not openly endorsed the plan . it is not surprising , as he is facing pressure from multiple fronts and seems to be caught between two options : ceasefire or coalition.the families of the hostages , whose ordeal has gripped the nation , and israel’s international allies are calling for a deal . from the people captured in october , 116 remain in captivity ; more than a third of them have already been officially declared dead , a number that is probably higher.among those against the proposal , full details of which have not been made public , are two of mr netanyahu’s far-right ministers , itamar ben-gvir and bezalel smotrich . they have threatened to quit the government if the deal goes ahead , which could lead to the collapse of the netanyahu coalition . “ temporarily in israel there will be more pressure from certain quarters on netanyahu to not do any deal , that we should continue to do rescue operations , ” gershon baskin , who helped negotiated a deal with hamas for the release of captured israeli soldier gilad shalit in 2011 , said . “ anyone who thinks logically and rationally knows that the only way to get [ the ] hostages home is through a negotiated deal . ” the resignation of benny gantz from the emergency government on sunday is likely to result in more power to both mr ben-gvir and mr smotrich – and , possibly , in more pressure from them on mr netanyahu . described as a moderate , mr gantz is considered a possible candidate to be the next prime minister.in israel , much of the dispute over the current proposal is around the commitment to a permanent cessation of hostilities – in other words , the end of the war . mr netanyahu has insisted israel will not accept any plan before the destruction of hamas’s military and governing capabilities , a choice of words that is vague enough to leave his options open . “ i believe that netanyahu prefers his coalition over bringing our boys and girls home , ” said michael hauser tov , chief political correspondent at the haaretz newspaper , which is critical of the prime minister . this is a common suspicion in israel and elsewhere : that mr netanyahu is interested in prolonging the war for his own political survival . “ i think netanyahu will try to continue with the negotiations only for his international needs and the relationship with president biden . and , on the other hand , he’ll try to sabotage the negotiations because he wants to keep his coalition stable . ” hamas has not yet given a formal response to the plan outlined by president biden . one of its key demands is a guarantee that the israeli military will not resume its offensive against the group once the hostages are released . “ hamas , from my experience with them , puts up a position and they stay firm to it . how long can they last ? i don’t know , ” mr baskin said . “ my perception is that the longer israel continues this war , the easier for [ hamas ] to recruit new recruits from bereaved families and people who’ve lost their homes , and an armed insurgency against the israelis will continue as long as israel is in gaza . ” the israeli rescue in gaza , which resulted in the death of one israeli special forces officer , was considered a successful operation by israel’s top authorities , despite the carnage in nuseirat that has been largely ignored in israel . “ if anyone believes that [ saturday’s ] operation absolves the government to strike a deal , they are living a fantasy , ” nahum barnea , an israeli political commentator , wrote in the yedioth ahronoth newspaper . “ the opposite is true . the joy over the successful rescue of the four only evinced the need for a deal . ” hours after the four freed hostages arrived in a hospital near tel aviv , mr netanyahu visited them and their families . it did not go unnoticed that this happened before the end of the jewish sabbath , when official activities are often muted , and was accompanied by a torrent of videos and photos released by his team . “ when the ending is bad , the prime minister doesn’t show up . he doesn’t call , either , ” avi marciano , whose daughter noa was killed in captivity , wrote on facebook.us secretary of state antony blinken is back in the middle east , his eighth trip to the region since the hamas attacks , in another effort to push for a deal . there are also growing concerns that , without a ceasefire in gaza , violence might escalate along israel’s border with lebanon , where the iranian-backed hezbollah movement has carried out near-daily attacks.with a wide gap remaining between israel and hamas , us pressure is not a guarantee of progress . “ there’s no quick end to this war … this could theoretically go on for years , ” mr baskin said . “ i really want to be optimistic , but it’s very difficult to be . ”",thousands march through london for return of hamas hostages

"" many people were in the streets , scared and running away . it was as if it were judgment day . no-one knew where to go , "" mohammed mahmoud hamed told the bbc . "" there were many people killed , so many that we couldn't even get to them . they couldn't rescue or retrieve the bodies , especially those who were wounded . people were scared to go rescue them because of the intense shooting and bombing , "" he said . the israeli military said aircraft had "" struck dozens of military targets for the success of the operation "" . the two hospitals in central gaza , al-aqsa martyrs ' hospital in deir al-balah and al-awda , a facility in nuseirat , were already at breaking point and were quickly overwhelmed with bloodied casualties including many children laid out in the corridors.at al-awda sitting at the bedside of his young daughter , her head bandaged , was mohamed al assar .

2024-06-16T13:45:22.056Z,BBC,"when is a ceasefire not a ceasefire ? according to the israeli army , when it’s a “ local , tactical pause of military activity for humanitarian purposes ” . israel’s humanitarian aid coordinator for gaza set out the details of the scheduled daily pause in fighting between 08:00 and 19:00 local time , along a key route running north from the kerem shalom crossing point , where aid is waiting to be delivered.the announcement almost immediately triggered a furious political assault from far-right government ministers – and a rapid defence from israel’s army , insisting that it did not signal an end to the fighting in southern gaza , or any change to the entry of humanitarian aid.the fact that this announcement has proved so explosive highlights the increasingly fraught situation of israel’s prime minister , caught between the costs of his vague and so far unattainable military goals of dismantling hamas and bringing home the hostages , and the political allies he relies on to stay in power . agencies will still need to coordinate their movements with the israeli army , and the gaza director for the world food programme , matt hollingworth , said the test would be whether that coordination became smoother and faster as a result.but he also said that coordination was only part of the obstacle agencies faced in delivering aid inside gaza.sunday's announcement "" doesn’t resolve the issue of insecurity and criminality , ” he said . “ and this is the most dangerous area of the gaza strip right now for moving aid . ” aid agencies reported over the weekend that the continuing war was fuelling acute malnutrition in parts of gaza.israel is under pressure – from ngos , allies and its own high court – to get more aid into gaza.but prime minister benjamin netanyahu faces stiff opposition from two far-right cabinet colleagues , who say they will bring down his government if he agrees to end the war , and who see aid deliveries as delaying israel’s victory.they reacted furiously to today’s announcement , with internal security minister , itamar ben-gvir , describing “ whoever made this decision ” as “ evil ” and “ a fool ” . finance minister , bezalel smotrich , said that humanitarian aid helped keep hamas in power and risked putting “ the achievements of the war down the drain ” . that the army could issue this message on a day when israel was burying eleven of its soldiers , he said , was a symptom of the leadership giving too much weight to international opinion and not enough to the forces on the ground.both men have threatened to bring down mr netanyahu’s coalition government if he ends the war , as america wants.but pressure over the costs of that war are rising at home too . israel’s parallel conflict with hezbollah in lebanon has escalated in recent days , highlighting the broader risks of continuing the war with their hamas allies . last night , large crowds turned out to protest in tel aviv , calling on mr netanyahu to end the conflict in gaza and sign a deal to return 120 israeli hostages home.and the funerals of eleven soldiers , killed in gaza over the weekend , are again pulling into focus questions over how the stated war aims of israel’s prime minister can be achieved.mr netanyahu has promised “ total victory ” against hamas . he has framed the current operation in rafah as an assault on the group’s last remaining battalions in gaza – necessary to destroy it , he says.but it’s clear that even dismantling hamas as a structured military organisation does not mean an end to the conflict entirely . israeli forces still face guerrilla operations by hamas fighters in areas they have previously cleared.and there’s no sign that the group’s key leaders – yahya sinwar and mohammed deif – have been killed or captured.for mr netanyahu , ending the war is likely to bring a fresh battle for his own political survival.the divisions laid bare today between his army and his allies highlight the tensions between rhetoric and reality in this war.and the tensions mr netanyahu faces in straddling them : caught between the promise of “ total victory ” and the prospect of a "" forever war "" .",military ‘ pause ’ on gaza road inflames divisions in israeli government
2024-06-17T10:04:40.075Z,BBC,"israel’s prime minister benjamin netanyahu has dissolved his six-member war cabinet , a widely expected decision that follows the departure of centrist opposition leader benny gantz and his ally gadi eisenkot.israeli media report that sensitive issues about the war with hamas in gaza will now be decided by a smaller forum.since mr gantz quit eight days ago over what he said was the lack of strategy for the war , there have been calls from far-right ministers to take his place.by dissolving the war cabinet , mr netanyahu avoids a tricky situation with his coalition partners and international allies.a spokesman for the israel defense forces ( idf ) said that , as far as it was concerned , it would not affect the chain of command . mr gantz and mr eisenkot joined a national unity government with mr netanyahu’s right-wing coalition days after the start of the war in october.the two former idf chiefs of staff announced their resignations on 9 june , with mr gantz saying that the prime minister’s leadership was “ preventing us from approaching true victory ” . immediately afterwards , far-right national security minister itamar ben-gvir said he had written to mr netanyahu to demand that he be added to the war cabinet.on sunday night , mr netanyahu reportedly informed ministers that he had decided to dissolve the decision-making body rather than bring in new members . “ the [ war ] cabinet was in the coalition agreement with gantz at his request . as soon as gantz left - there is no need for a cabinet anymore , "" he said , according to the jerusalem post.haaretz reported that some of the issues previously discussed by the war cabinet would be transferred for discussion in the 14-member security cabinet , which includes mr ben-gvir and fellow far-right finance minister bezalel smotrich.it said sensitive decisions would be addressed in a “ smaller consultation forum ” , which was expected to include defence minister yoav gallant , strategic affairs minister ron dermer and the chairman of the ultra-orthodox shas party , aryeh deri . the three men were in the war cabinet along with the prime minister , mr gantz and mr eisenkot.the idf's chief spokesman , rear admiral daniel hagari , insisted on monday that such moves would not affect its operations . "" cabinet members are being changed and the method is being changed . we have the echelon , we know the chain of command . we're working according to the chain of command . this is a democracy , ” he told reporters.the israeli military launched a campaign in gaza to destroy hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern israel on 7 october , during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.more than 37,340 people have been killed in gaza since then , according to the territory's hamas-run health ministry . there have been further signs of strain in the israeli government in the past day , with mr netanyahu and his far-right ministers criticising a decision by the idf to introduce daytime “ tactical pauses in military activity ” near the southern gaza city of rafah to allow more deliveries of humanitarian aid.the pauses are meant to allow lorries to collect aid from the israeli-controlled kerem shalom border crossing , south-east of rafah , and then travel safely to reach the main north-south road inside gaza . supplies have been held back at the crossing point since israel began an operation in rafah last month.but mr ben-gvir decried the policy as foolish , while israeli media quoted mr netanyahu as saying : “ we have a country with an army , not an army with a country . ” the idf responded by saying that the pauses did not mean the fighting in southern gaza would stop , which created confusion over what exactly was happening on the ground.the un agency for palestinian refugees ( unrwa ) , which is the largest humanitarian organisation in gaza , reported that fighting was continuing in rafah and elsewhere in the south on monday and that “ operationally nothing has changed yet ” . the idf meanwhile said that its troops were “ continuing intelligence-based , targeted operations in the area of rafah ” . it added that they had located weapons , struck structures rigged with explosives and eliminated “ several terrorists ” in the tal al-sultan area.with little sign of progress towards a full ceasefire in gaza , there have been new warnings from the israeli military that the lower-level conflict with the lebanese armed group hezbollah is now threatening to spiral into a wider war . following a recent intensification in exchanges of fire , a key us diplomat is returning to the region to try to reduce tensions on the israel-lebanon border .",gaza : israel's netanyahu dissolves war cabinet after departures
