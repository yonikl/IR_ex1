2024-05-22T18:18:03+0000,The New York Times,"advertisement bythomas l . friedman opinion columnist the decision by spain , norway and ireland on wednesday to recognize an independent palestinian state marks the latest brick in the wall of rejection being built around israel’s current far-right government , which is asking the world to let it destroy hamas in gaza while refusing to work on a new future with non-hamas palestinians . more than140 countries and the holy seehave recognized the right of palestinians to have a state in the west bank , gaza and east jerusalem . what is noteworthy about this latest move , though , is that major western european countries , and the united states , had resisted going there , arguing that peace should be worked out between the two parties . until today . my focus is always on the practical : will these recognitions of a nonexistent palestinian state with undefined borders lead to the only sustainable solution — a real-life peace between two states for two indigenous communities — jews and palestinians ? the answer is yes and no . in the short term , these diplomatic recognitions from fellow democracies will not move the israeli public , yohanan plesner , president of the israel democracy institute , told me . in the wake of the horrific murders , rapes and kidnappings perpetrated by hamas on oct . 7 , he said , europeans telling israel that it must accept a palestinian state — “ without even mentioning that it must be demilitarized or any obligations on the part of palestinians to reject hamas ” — will be “ rejected ” by the israeli silent majority . in the long term , though , it is precisely these kinds of diplomatic shocks that could lead the opposition leaders in israel to finally escape from the gravitational pull of prime minister benjamin netanyahu — who dominates what is or is not permissible to say on this subject — and start calling for two states on terms israel can live with . one can already see signs of that . if that does not transpire , though , israel is heading for a world of hurt . those recognitions of a palestinian state by european nations “ are a huge straw in the wind , that will grow into a hurricane if israel does not change course , ” craig charney , a pollster who was a member of nelson mandela’s polling team in the 1990s , told me . charney explained that the isolation of south africa’s apartheid regime started with a voluntary arms embargo in the 1960s , which after the soweto uprising morphed in the 1970s into a formal u.n . arms embargo , which grew into a popular cause on campuses and in boardrooms in the early 1980s , which grew into a broader economic , military and travel embargo in the mid-1980s — until two great leaders , nelson mandela and f.w . de klerk , finally emerged to end apartheid . “ but it was a very painful journey , ” he said . thomas l . friedman is the foreign affairs opinion columnist . he joined the paper in 1981 and has won three pulitzer prizes . he is the author of seven books , including “ from beirut to jerusalem , ” which won the national book award . @ tomfriedman•facebook advertisement",western europe is starting to send a vital warning to israel

the new york times , ” i’m sabrina tavernise . and this is “ the daily . ” [ music playing ] in an unexpected speech last week , president biden revealed the details of a secret proposal intended to end the war in gaza . most surprising was where that proposal had come from . today , my colleague isabel kershner explains biden’s gambit and the difficult choice it presents for israel’s leader , benjamin netanyahu . it’s wednesday , june 5 . isabel , tell us about this speech from president biden last friday at the white house . so last friday , president biden made a speech . and it came at a pivotal moment in the war because for weeks beforehand , the whole world had been focused on israel’s long delayed invasion of the city of rafah , the southernmost city in the gaza strip and also the city that about a million displaced palestinians had fled to to find refuge from fighting in other areas of the gaza strip . so understandably , there was huge concern internationally and particularly a lot of pressure coming from the white house for israel not to go into rafah . it was just considered way too risky . but for the israelis , they were saying the last battalions of hamas are there . many hostages are there . and without taking control of that area , the israelis felt they wouldn’t have accomplished anything . so in the end , they did begin to move into the eastern part of rafah . but then as the israelis were operating in eastern rafah with their tanks and ground troops , the israelis on may 26 carried out a strike , an airstrike . this was an attack meant to target two hamas operatives . and they did , in fact , strike those two operatives and killed them with what they said were the smallest missiles that their jets could carry . unfortunately , that strike then set off an absolutely devastating fire because the area the strike took place in is right by a camp of makeshift shacks and tents where hundreds or thousands of palestinians were sheltering . this fire ripped through the tents and ended up killing 45 civilians according to the gazan health authorities . and it was exactly the kind of disaster that everybody had feared if israel were to operate in this crowded , southern , dusty border town . which presumably put a lot more pressure on the biden white house to do something about this war . that’s right . now , we know that the white house , the biden administration , would very much like to see this war come to an end as soon as possible . and then on friday — good afternoon . before i begin my remarks — — president biden gives a speech . and surprisingly — now to another issue . — this speech when it turns to the israel-hamas war was not about rafah . in fact , it was something totally different and much bigger . israel has now offered — israel is offering a comprehensive new proposal . it’s a road map to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages . what president biden described as the outline of an israeli proposal for a ceasefire truce and hostage release deal with hamas that would end the war . this proposal has been transmitted by qatar to hamas . today , i want to lay out his terms for the american citizens and for the world . and , isabel , what did he mean exactly by the israeli proposal ? well , there’s been a lot of smoke and mirrors around this whole process of talks and negotiations between israel and hamas . and , in fact , the last time we saw a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release was at the end of last november . but , in fact , there had been this on again , off again attempt at getting negotiations back on track over the last few weeks . and it soon came to light that this was the latest israeli proposal that was apparently presented . and this proposal it turns out was unanimously approved as a basis for the negotiation by israel’s war cabinet . and here is an american president spelling out this previously undisclosed israeli position on television . absolutely . and the israeli public knew nothing about this . so what does biden actually say ? what does he say is in this proposal ? ok , well , what he says — this new proposal has three phases . three . he presents it as a deal in three phases , which is generally in line with all the previous plans of the last few months . and the first phase would involve a six week temporary ceasefire during which a certain number of hostages — — including women , the elderly , the wounded — — the most vulnerable ones — there are american hostages who would be released at this stage . and we want them home . — would be exchanged for hundreds of palestinian prisoners in israeli jails . and israeli forces would be withdrawing from population centers within the gaza strip . — with 600 trucks carrying aid into gaza every single day . humanitarian aid would be flowing at a much greater level and generally the beginning of a change in atmosphere and climate . so this seems in some ways like the temporary ceasefire in november , right ? women and children , vulnerable hostages , a cease in hostilities for six weeks . what about phase two ? well , here we get to the crucial part because during phase one , the sides are supposed to start negotiating phase two . now , i’ll be straight with you . there are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two . and phase two is supposed to culminate in all remaining living hostages released and exchanged again for many more palestinian prisoners from israeli jails . this would involve also the withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . and in his speech , president biden does say that as long as hamas lives up to its commitments , the temporary ceasefire would become , in the words of the israeli proposal — — the cessation of hostilities permanently . ” — essentially meaning the end of the war . so biden is actually talking about the end of the war . he’s saying that out loud , which is not something we’ve been hearing from israel at all , at least publicly . on the contrary , in fact , our colleagues wrote a story at the end of last week when one senior israeli official said the war would last until at least the end of the year . so this is something very new . absolutely . and then we get to phase three because there’s a third phase to this plan . and that is moving ahead already to the day after the war , which has been kept very vague by the israelis up to now . and the phase that president biden outlined was essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for gaza . that’s the offer that’s now on the table and what we’ve been asking for . it’s what we need . so the president is saying that this is a deal that should be accepted , that meets the requirements of both sides , that can point to a path forward . and he makes a couple of points to bolster that — the people of israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they’ve devastated hamas forces . — one of which is that in his view , hamas has already been sufficiently degraded and devastated to the point where , as president biden puts it , hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another october 7 . in other words , that goal of total victory that netanyahu talks about , biden is actually saying they’ve accomplished it . the israelis have accomplished it . not really , actually . he takes on netanyahu on the total victory slogan — indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring israel and will not bring down — will only bog down israel in gaza , draining the economic , military , and human resources and furthering israel’s isolation in the world . — and says that total victory is a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal that would basically mean indefinite war because what does total victory mean ? you can’t kill every last hamas operative . and even if you did , presumably there would be many more palestinians who would come to replace them . and in a way , he’s using this speech to go over the head of netanyahu and go straight to the israeli people and present them with these terms to in a way corner netanyahu , but also to put down the gauntlet to hamas and say , here are the terms . they sound very like the terms hamas was asking for and putting hamas equally on the spot to come back to the table even though israel is still fighting in rafah . it’s time to begin this new stage , for the hostages to come home , for israel to be secure , for the suffering to stop . it’s time for this war to end , for the day after to begin . thank you very much . so biden is essentially saying here , listen . israel , you have won the war effectively . hamas is degraded . now it’s time to accept the ceasefire deal that you yourself have designed . what was the reaction inside israel ? the initial reaction took a while to come because president biden made his speech . and it landed at about 8:30 in the evening on friday israel time . and this is the time where many , many families are sitting around their sabbath dinner table , as i was with my family and friends , not watching the news , not looking at phones for the most part . observant jews have actually switched off for the sabbath and aren’t going to hear any news until saturday night . and as the news did begin to trickle out , it really shook israel up . and this leaves netanyahu in a great bind because for months , he’s really been playing for time and juggling competing interests and really not having to make a decision one way or the other on what comes next . we’ve been hearing that rafah is really the last stronghold of hamas , and this is something the military has to do . but after that , there was just a kind of void and no news on the hostages or a ceasefire or a deal on the horizon . and so when this speech was made , suddenly it shook up everything . and netanyahu is suddenly facing a very crucial choice . we’ll be right back . so , isabel , you said that this is a very important moment for netanyahu , that now he really is facing a choice . what does he do ? what does he come out and say ? so his office actually put out a statement . and his first response was that israel is sticking to its objectives of the destruction of hamas’s military and governing capabilities . and he said the actual proposal put forward by israel would allow israel to uphold these principles . now , this was a slightly ambiguous response that you could pass in different ways . he wasn’t exactly denying that this was an israeli proposal . and indeed , we quickly learned that , in fact , israel’s war cabinet had unanimously voted on the general outlines of what president biden had presented . he wasn’t denying it . but the one thing missing from that statement was this declaration we’d been hearing for months on end that the war wouldn’t end until there was total victory . that had gone . so total victory had gone , which is a difference , which means potentially the war goals have shifted a little bit . well , the way he articulated it is talking about the degradation or dismantling of hamas’s capabilities as opposed to talking about the total elimination of hamas as a movement . and then he followed up . his office put out another statement on saturday , also still during the sabbath , which was a little stronger . he said under the proposal , israel would insist on its conditions being met , these same war objectives , before a permanent cease fire is put in place and that any suggestion that israel would agree to that permanent ceasefire before the conditions are met would be a non-starter . but again , it was kind of conditional and could be interpreted in different ways . at what point does one declare that the capabilities have been dismantled or sufficiently degraded ? so it left a lot of room for maneuver . and so what is netanyahu up to here , isabel ? i think he’s trying to balance all these competing sides . he’s seems to be trying not to torpedo the chances of this deal but at the same time to be able to hang on politically when he has a very serious challenge looming within his government should this deal go ahead . so tell me about that challenge . israel’s government is formed of a coalition of parties . netanyahu’s likud is the main party . but it totally relies for its majority in parliament on its partners in the coalition . and they include two ultra-orthodox parties and two far right parties . and the far right parties have both come out explicitly saying that should this deal as outlined by president biden go ahead , they will not be party to it . so netanyahu faces this real political danger on his right . that’s right . so there are the leaders of these two right wing parties who he relies on for his coalition government . he relies on them for his majority in parliament . and the leaders of those parties are itamar ben-gvir , who’s the national security minister , and bezalel smotrich , who is currently the finance minister . now , neither of these parties nor their leaders are sitting in the much more tight and small war cabinet that actually oversees and directs and makes the decisions on the course of the war in gaza . they were seen as way too extreme to be part of that forum . that forum is much more reflective of the national consensus . but these parties are part of the broader government . and they have threatened not only to oppose the deal as outlined by president biden should it go ahead . but they have actually vowed if it does go ahead , they would withdraw their support to netanyahu and bring his government down . and if his government were to collapse as a result , he would then be facing a new election . now , he has been trying to stave off the end of the war and the prospect of new elections ever since october 7 because then he’s in danger of facing that public reckoning for the perceived failures that the government’s policy failures , the military’s failures , the intelligence failures leading up to the hamas led attack of october the 7 . but we really might be getting to crunch time when it comes to his political lifeline here . so this is a pretty dramatic moment for netanyahu then , right ? i mean , he’s under tremendous pressure from biden , his biggest ally . biden’s basically asking him to choose between this deal , which means the end of the war , something his coalition partners , these hard right guys , really don’t want , and his own power essentially , right ? staying alive politically or the end of the war and the hostages coming home . that is a very stark choice . absolutely . and then there are other choices that he has to weigh because israel has been increasingly isolated and under international censure for its prosecution of the war in gaza . netanyahu himself is facing the prospect of possible arrest warrants being put out against him from the international criminal court in the hague . israel is in the dark on a genocide case in the international court of justice in the hague . so should he go ahead with this deal , he has been offered sweeteners like an invitation to address congress . and this would in a way be a way of bringing him back into the fold . so , isabel , say netanyahu approves this proposal . how likely is it that the right wing , smotrich and ben-gvir , actually do leave the government ? i mean , they would be giving up power , too , no ? they would . and if we look at all the opinion polls being done in israel in the last few months , bezalel smotrich and his religious zionism party for one would barely scrape back into parliament in another election . and therefore , there’s a lot at stake for him , too , and for itamar ben-gvir because if the next government that’s formed is not going to be a right wing and far right government , he would find himself out of power , too . but , isabel , let’s say they do leave . what happens in that scenario ? well , the assumption is that the government would collapse . it would lose its majority . and naturally , the knesset would vote to dissolve itself and set a date for a new election , which would have to come within five months . and during that period , this government would turn into a caretaker government . now , usually a caretaker government that’s a transitional one in that period before elections isn’t supposed to make dramatic decisions for the country . but being a caretaker government during wartime , this puts israel in uncharted political territory . then theoretically , if we were to ask could such a government even approve a deal once it had been negotiated , even without the support of those far right parties , apparently there would still be enough in favor to see it through . interesting . so it seems like there are a lot of possibilities for how this could go . but it does in a way rely on netanyahu deciding what israel’s course will be . and it seems like he probably needs to land on one of these options . what do you think he’s going to do ? well , it might not end up being black and white , take the deal or not take the deal . we might end up seeing something in between because i think netanyahu , who is facing huge public pressure to bring back those hostages who still are alive , would definitely want to move ahead with at least that first part of the deal that would see a six week temporary ceasefire in return for the most vulnerable hostages . and then you get into the much trickier part of that negotiation for the next stage , which would involve essentially ending the war . and it could be that we might see netanyahu wanting to proceed with this deal but only partially and then get to a point where it can’t go further . and netanyahu is probably very keenly aware of the american political timetable . there are skeptics here who say that by labor day , all the american attention is going to be focused on america’s own internal politics running up to the november elections and that netanyahu basically just has to survive another 90 days to get to that point , at which point the pressure subsides . so this is a scenario in which he just basically runs out the clock . he keeps on that tightrope . that’s a possibility , absolutely , and one that he would be very adept at doing if the past is anything to go by . ok , so there are a number of ways netanyahu could actually handle this . how should we think about what biden has really accomplished here ? well , i think it’s hard to say that one speech is going to change the course or the outcome of this war . but it certainly has crystallized the issues and brought them out into the light after months and months of murkiness that netanyahu was able to in a way hide behind and operate within . and i think now he’s in the spotlight . and assuming that hamas is willing to accept and go along with this negotiation for this proposal , the israeli public’s expectations have certainly been risen now toward a deal . and all eyes are now on netanyahu to see which way he will go . isabel , thank you . thank you so much . in an interview with “ time magazine ” published on tuesday , biden was asked whether netanyahu was prolonging the war in gaza in an effort to hold on to office . biden said , quote , “ there is every reason for people to draw that conclusion . ” we’ll be right back . here’s what else you should know today . on tuesday , republican lawmakers in arizona voted to put a ballot measure before voters in november that would make unlawfully crossing the border from mexico a crime in the state . the move would put the border crisis directly onto the ballot in a key swing state , potentially firing up anti-immigration conservative voters . it is similar to a law passed in texas earlier this year , currently held up in court after it was challenged by the biden administration . and the results of a major election in india have been tallied . and they are deeply disappointing for india’s prime minister narendra modi . modi appeared to have secured a third consecutive term in office . however , his bjp party did not deliver the landslide victory it had promised and even lost its majority in parliament . now modi and the bjp must come to an agreement with other parties in order to form a coalition government in india’s parliamentary system . today’s episode was produced by will reid ,

end the war in gaza . most surprising was where that proposal had come from . today , my colleague isabel kershner explains biden’s gambit and the difficult choice it presents for israel’s leader , benjamin netanyahu . it’s wednesday , june 5 . isabel , tell us about this speech from president biden last friday at the white house . so last friday , president biden made a speech . and it came at a pivotal moment in the war because for weeks beforehand , the whole world had been focused on israel’s long delayed invasion of the city of rafah , the southernmost city in the gaza strip and also the city that about a million displaced palestinians had fled to to find refuge from fighting in other areas of the gaza strip . so understandably , there was huge concern internationally and particularly a lot of pressure coming from the white house for israel not to go into rafah . it was just considered way too risky . but for the israelis , they were saying the last battalions of hamas are there . many hostages are there . and without taking control of that area , the israelis felt they wouldn’t have accomplished anything . so in the end , they did begin to move into the eastern part of rafah . but then as the israelis were operating in eastern rafah with their tanks and ground troops , the israelis on may 26 carried out a strike , an airstrike . this was an attack meant to target two hamas operatives . and they did , in fact , strike those two operatives and killed them with what they said were the smallest missiles that their jets could carry . unfortunately , that strike then set off an absolutely devastating fire because the area the strike took place in is right by a camp of makeshift shacks and tents where hundreds or thousands of palestinians were sheltering . this fire ripped through the tents and ended up killing 45 civilians according to the gazan health authorities . and it was exactly the kind of disaster that everybody had feared if israel were to operate in this crowded , southern , dusty border town . which presumably put a lot more pressure on the biden white house to do something about this war . that’s right . now , we know that the white house , the biden administration , would very much like to see this war come to an end as soon as possible . and then on friday — good afternoon . before i begin my remarks — — president biden gives a speech . and surprisingly — now to another issue . — this speech when it turns to the israel-hamas war was not about rafah . in fact , it was something totally different and much bigger . israel has now offered — israel is offering a comprehensive new proposal . it’s a road map to an enduring ceasefire and the release of all hostages . what president biden described as the outline of an israeli proposal for a ceasefire truce and hostage release deal with hamas that would end the war . this proposal has been transmitted by qatar to hamas . today , i want to lay out his terms for the american citizens and for the world . and , isabel , what did he mean exactly by the israeli proposal ? well , there’s been a lot of smoke and mirrors around this whole process of talks and negotiations between israel and hamas . and , in fact , the last time we saw a negotiation actually result in a temporary cease fire and a partial hostage release was at the end of last november . but , in fact , there had been this on again , off again attempt at getting negotiations back on track over the last few weeks . and it soon came to light that this was the latest israeli proposal that was apparently presented . and this proposal it turns out was unanimously approved as a basis for the negotiation by israel’s war cabinet . and here is an american president spelling out this previously undisclosed israeli position on television . absolutely . and the israeli public knew nothing about this . so what does biden actually say ? what does he say is in this proposal ? ok , well , what he says — this new proposal has three phases . three . he presents it as a deal in three phases , which is generally in line with all the previous plans of the last few months . and the first phase would involve a six week temporary ceasefire during which a certain number of hostages — — including women , the elderly , the wounded — — the most vulnerable ones — there are american hostages who would be released at this stage . and we want them home . — would be exchanged for hundreds of palestinian prisoners in israeli jails . and israeli forces would be withdrawing from population centers within the gaza strip . — with 600 trucks carrying aid into gaza every single day . humanitarian aid would be flowing at a much greater level and generally the beginning of a change in atmosphere and climate . so this seems in some ways like the temporary ceasefire in november , right ? women and children , vulnerable hostages , a cease in hostilities for six weeks . what about phase two ? well , here we get to the crucial part because during phase one , the sides are supposed to start negotiating phase two . now , i’ll be straight with you . there are a number of details to negotiate to move from phase one to phase two . and phase two is supposed to culminate in all remaining living hostages released and exchanged again for many more palestinian prisoners from israeli jails . this would involve also the withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . and in his speech , president biden does say that as long as hamas lives up to its commitments , the temporary ceasefire would become , in the words of the israeli proposal — — the cessation of hostilities permanently . ” — essentially meaning the end of the war . so biden is actually talking about the end of the war . he’s saying that out loud , which is not something we’ve been hearing from israel at all , at least publicly . on the contrary , in fact , our colleagues wrote a story at the end of last week when one senior israeli official said the war would last until at least the end of the year . so this is something very new . absolutely . and then we get to phase three because there’s a third phase to this plan . and that is moving ahead already to the day after the war , which has been kept very vague by the israelis up to now . and the phase that president biden outlined was essentially just for a major reconstruction plan for gaza . that’s the offer that’s now on the table and what we’ve been asking for . it’s what we need . so the president is saying that this is a deal that should be accepted , that meets the requirements of both sides , that can point to a path forward . and he makes a couple of points to bolster that — the people of israel should know they can make this offer without any further risk to their own security because they’ve devastated hamas forces . — one of which is that in his view , hamas has already been sufficiently degraded and devastated to the point where , as president biden puts it , hamas is no longer capable of carrying out another october 7 . in other words , that goal of total victory that netanyahu talks about , biden is actually saying they’ve accomplished it . the israelis have accomplished it . not really , actually . he takes on netanyahu on the total victory slogan — indefinite war in pursuit of an unidentified notion of total victory will not bring israel and will not bring down — will only bog down israel in gaza , draining the economic , military , and human resources and furthering israel’s isolation in the world . — and says that total victory is a kind of nebulous and unrealistic goal that would basically mean indefinite war because what does total victory mean ? you can’t kill every last hamas operative . and even if you did , presumably there would be many more palestinians who would come to replace them . and in a way , he’s using this speech to go over the head of netanyahu and go straight to the israeli people and present them with these terms to in a way corner netanyahu , but also to put down the gauntlet to hamas and say , here are the terms . they sound very like the terms hamas was asking for and putting hamas equally on the spot to come back to the table even though israel is still fighting in rafah . it’s time to begin this new stage , for the hostages to come home , for israel to be secure , for the suffering to stop . it’s time for this war to end , for the day after to begin . thank you very much . so biden is essentially saying here , listen . israel , you have won the war effectively . hamas is degraded . now it’s time to accept the ceasefire deal that you yourself have designed . what was the reaction inside israel ? the initial reaction took a while to come because president biden made his speech . and it landed at about 8:30 in the evening on friday israel time . and this is the time where many , many families are sitting around their sabbath

2024-06-11T08:55:04+0000,The New York Times,"israel-hamaswar advertisement transcript in the occupied west bank , palestinians live in the shadow of the ongoing war in gaza . for them , this has meant increased raids and arrests , tightening security restrictions , settler violence and economic turmoil . we spent time with two palestinians whose lives and livelihoods are being reshaped by the war and who worry that some of these changes may be long lasting . 29-year-old taxi driver and tour guide laith al-muti now waits all day here at one of the israeli-controlled checkpoints into bethlehem . but these days , barely any visitors come through . thirteen miles away in the tel rumeida area of hebron , wijdan ziadeh’s life is also at a standstill . the site of an israeli settlement , palestinians in the area say their movement , limited before the war , has felt even more restricted since oct . 7 . control over security in hebron is divided into two zones . h1 is managed by the palestinian authority and h2 , where ziadeh lives , is managed by the israeli military . the israeli military told the times that security measures have increased in the west bank as part of a response to terrorist operatives , including hamas , and that their forces are in tel rumeida to help ensure the safety of all residents . but ziadeh lives in fear of scenes of settler aggression like this one captured by a nearby palestinian resident . ziadeh says since the war , her settler neighbors have become even more aggressive towards her and her two sons . throughout the west bank , incidents of settler violence against palestinians jumped in the aftermath of oct . 7 , according to the u.n . , who have recorded nearly 950 attacks as of june 2024 . palestinians in the area say that the israeli military are there to protect the settlers and that settler violence against palestinians largely goes unpunished , a decades-long pattern detailed in a recent times investigation . back in bethlehem , laith also fears for the future . sites he used to frequent with tourists , like the church of the nativity , now sit empty . al-muti and ziadeh say they don’t know what’s next for them or for others in the west bank . bysarah kerr as the war in gaza enters its eighth month , palestinians living under israeli occupation in the west bank continue to faceonerous restrictions , economic difficulties and an increased military presence — changes that some worry may become the new normal . throughout the west bank , daily life — restricted before oct . 7 — has been further complicated by myriad factors . these include regular raids and arrests by israeli forces , emboldened settlers and regulations that have hampered the economy , such as the cancellation of permits to work in israel and an increase in internal checkpoints and roadblocks , complicating movement throughout the territory . the israeli military said there had been a “ significant increase ” in terrorist attacks in the west bank since the beginning of the war and told the new york times that arrests of suspected “ terrorist operatives , ” as well as the strategic placement of security forces , were necessary “ to improve the safety of all residents of the sector . ” we spent time with two palestinians in the west bank to learn how they have been affected by these changes . in bethlehem , a city whose economy islargely dependent on tourism , few are arriving to visit sites like the church of the nativity , the supposed birthplace of jesus . laith al-muti , 29 , a local tour guide and taxi driver , spends his days waiting at the main checkpoint from jerusalem into bethlehem , hoping to attract local fares . al-muti and other drivers said they were making a fraction of what they earned before the war . “ i don’t know for how long people will have energy , ” said al-muti . “ i might be making 20 or 40 shekels , ( roughly $ 5 - $ 11 ) working in my taxi , but some people haven’t earned one shekel in seven months . ” thirteen miles away in the tel rumeida area of hebron , widjan ziadeh , 56 , a widow , and her sons live in fear . hebron is divided into two zones : h1 , where security is controlled by the palestinian authority , and h2 , where security is controlled by the israeli military . tel rumeida , located in h2 , is surrounded by israeli-run checkpoints . since the war , palestinians in the area said they had been subject to increased restrictions and difficulties . tel rumeida , the site of an israeli settlement , has some who are violent and aggressive , according to palestinians in the area , and tensions have run high for decades . ziadeh said her son faris , 20 , had nearly lost all vision in one eye following a settler attack in 2022 , but the family never filed a criminal complaint to the israeli authorities because oflimited expectations of justice . for now , ziadeh is determined to stay and keep her house from being taken over by settlers . “ we won’t leave . this is our land and we’ll stay here , ” she said . “ we’ll live and die in suffering . ” sarah kerris a times senior video journalist covering news and investigations.more about sarah kerr advertisement","as the war in gaza drags on , palestinians in the west bank have ‘ reached rock bottom ’"

so first , let me just give you the context of what happened . this happened in northern gaza , the place that has been at war the longest . that’s where israeli ground forces began their invasion of the gaza strip . many people have left the north . but we do know that some 300,000 people are still there . the people who have remained there are really living through very desperate conditions . very little aid has come in to the north of gaza since the war started and especially in recent weeks . food is barely available for the people who’ve remained there . the un has been warning of a famine that is looming over the territory . hiba , why is there so little aid getting into northern gaza in particular ? well , first of all , there’s less aid getting into the gaza strip in general , not just the north . there’s multiple reasons as to why that is . but one of the main reasons is that israel itself has been very slow to approve permits and often denies permits for aid trucks and aid convoys to come in , specifically to the north . because israel says that they don’t want the aid to end up in the hands of hamas , that they don’t want them to get a hold of the packages . got it . when israel does approve the permits and the aid trucks start their journeys , there’s multiple hurdles that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people . some of these hurdles include the widespread destruction in gaza . there’s vast damage across the gaza strip . roads have been destroyed , there’s rubble everywhere , and it’s very difficult for the trucks to actually move through that rubble and through those roads . then these aid convoys have to go through multiple israeli checkpoints on the way . there’s often significant delays at these checkpoints by israeli soldiers who are inspecting the aid . this makes it hard for the trucks to make it from where they enter in the south all the way to the north in the specific safety window that they’re given . sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they got delayed so much that they can’t keep going . hm . but there’s a particular problem with the north , where fighting has been going on the longest . the civil order is now breaking down , essentially . we know that frequent israeli strikes on palestinian policemen meant that there’s really no one to run security for official groups and for aid convoys , leaving them vulnerable to attacks by local gangs who are trying to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it , and also , hungry and desperate civilians who are trying to grab the aid and take as much as they can , which means that they end up stealing some of it , looting some of it , while it’s still on the way . right . so it’s lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown . i mean , this is kind of the downstream effects of extended war in a particular place . there’s a power vacuum . that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the united nations to be able to operate safely . right . the few aid trucks that do come in have had to either suspend their aid deliveries into the north or have not been able to deliver aid there . the last time unrwa , the un agency in charge of palestinian refugees , tried to bring trucks to the north was nearly a month ago . but they said that one of their convoys came under fire . another major aid provider , the world food program , said that they haven’t delivered aid there in over three weeks . they cited all of the reasons we talked about for this suspension . so while aid hasn’t been coming into the north , people have been growing more desperate and hungry and the situation there has been getting worse , which has been raising international alarm . there’s been increased calls on israel to let aid go through to the north and to alleviate the suffering of the residents there . so israel partnered with these local palestinian businessmen in gaza , and they promised to secure the aid convoys that the businessmen would supply and that would make their way into the north . they successfully did this three times last week . so people started being very hopeful that more would come , and ahead of the fourth delivery , they started to gather at this distribution point right outside of gaza city in the north . that brings us to thursday’s incident . [ music playing ] so last thursday around 4:45 am , around 38 aid trucks reached this distribution point . they start getting closer to the crowds of people who had camped there overnight waiting for this aid to come . when the people see the trucks coming , they’re very desperate . they surround them . they get on top of them . then at some point , israeli soldiers start firing shots . then it turned violent very fast . it ended with 118 palestinians dead and 760 injured . this is where the accounts diverge . ok . so let’s start with the israeli account . what do they say happened ? so the israeli military said that it was trying to secure the convoy and it had tanks nearby to make sure that the convoy reached the area . it did acknowledge that its troops had opened fire at the crowd , but they said that they opened fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approached their troops and endangered their lives . they said the shots that were fired weren’t really the reason why so many people died , but the reason that so many people died was because , in the chaos of all of it , they trampled each other and many had died from suffocation or trampling , and also that the trucks had run over some of the people who were trying to run away . oh , god . so the israelis don’t deny actually shooting , but they say it was more about controlling the crowd , kind of as warning shots type thing , and that this was not the way people actually died . they say the way people actually died was suffocation or being crushed by the aid trucks themselves . right . what did the gazan health authorities say ? so the gazan health authorities have actually been calling this the flour massacre , or the massacre of the hungry stomachs . because what they’re saying is that israeli forces fired at a crowd of hungry and desperate people who were waiting for aid . witnesses and palestinians who were there have said that although some people were trampled and possibly run over by the trucks , that was not the main reason for the high death toll . most of the people who were injured or killed were injured and killed by israeli fire . so the gazan health authorities are essentially saying this was a massacre by israel . right . do we know , hiba , what actually did happen ? what have you guys found in your reporting ? well , the israeli military released drone footage that it claimed showed a mass stampede in which gazans are trampled . but that video only added to the confusion of the sequence of events . the quality and the lengths of the clips made it more difficult to confirm these claims . right . it was just grainy . there was no sound . you saw people scramble and run , but you didn’t understand why . right . the drone footage was heavily edited . it left out key moments . but it did show hundreds of people circling around the trucks and hoping to catch a bag of flour . then suddenly , we see people start to panic and run in multiple directions . then they released another clip in which we see two israeli tanks that are positioned about a quarter mile down the road . then we see about a dozen bodies lying around them . we see people crawling and ducking for cover . [ crowd noise ] but we did have another video that was released by al jazeera . [ gunfire ] and it showed a crowd near the aid convoy . and it also captured the sound of gunfire and showed multiple tracer rounds , which is a special type of ammunition that helps troops fine tune their targeting when it’s dark . the tracer rounds originated from the direction of a nearby israeli military base . so although that did not conclude that the shots came from the direction of the israeli military , it did add another layer of evidence . so hiba , it sounds like these videos are suggestive but not conclusive . but what did the people you spoke to on the ground say , the eyewitnesses and survivors and doctors you spoke with . right . we spoke to witnesses and survivors as well as doctors at the hospitals that have taken in the people who were wounded and killed . they said that most of the people had died or were wounded by gunshots . the doctor who runs one of the four main hospitals in the area that took in the casualties told me that out of the 13 people who were killed and the 170 people who were wounded that the hospital took in , all of the injuries were of gunshot wounds . he said that they didn’t see any injuries that coincided with those of a stampede or people being run over by trucks . that account echoes the ones that we’ve heard from witnesses and people who were there , who saw people get shot and fall to the ground next to them . but in the chaos of everything , people were not checking who’s dead and who’s wounded . they were just taking the flour , and they were running for their lives . and although the accounts differ on both sides , what we do know is that many hungry and desperate people died while trying to get food and secure aid in a place where famine is looming and starvation is rampant . that’s what i spent the last few weeks reporting on . i’m trying to understand how people in the north of gaza specifically are surviving with such little food . we’ll be right back . so hiba , i want to talk about what people are doing to survive in northern gaza . but before we get to that , what is the big picture on the state of hunger in gaza ? hunger has reached unprecedented levels in gaza and specifically in northern gaza . we’re starting to already see reports of children dying from malnutrition and dehydration . this week , the health ministry said that 15 children have died from malnutrition and dehydration at just one of northern gaza’s hospitals . wow , 15 children have actually died ? yes . we also have the un and aid organizations saying that one in six children in northern gaza were acutely malnutritioned and that more than 90 percent of children under two are facing severe food poverty . the un humanitarian coordinator said that a quarter of all gazan residents are one step away from famine . how exactly are people surviving , hiba ? i mean , you’re talking to people in northern gaza . what are they saying ? i’ve been reporting on hunger for weeks . i’ve talked to people about what they’re doing in order to survive with such little food . [ non-english speech ] . [ non-english speech ] . i recently talked to one woman whose experience is very typical in northern gaza . her name is ghada krayem . she’s a 23-year-old woman from the north who stayed in the north and didn’t flee . tell me about ghada . [ non-english speech ] . ghada is one of 10 kids . she has six sisters and three brothers . she’s actually gaza’s first female solar power engineer . she’s won many awards internationally . she’s also the sole provider for her family . she’s used the money that she won from these grants and competitions to help her family through this war . with that money , she actually stockpiled a bunch of food in the beginning of the war , expecting the situation to deteriorate . she bought flour and milk and canned food and everything they might need . they stockpiled it in their home . how is it that they’re still in northern gaza ? well , actually , they tried to stay in their home for as long as they possibly could , until the ground fighting really basically reached their doorstep . [ non-english speech ] . at one point , early on during israel’s ground invasion of the north — [ non-english speech ] . — israeli soldiers came to their building and they forced them out . they asked everyone to leave the building , and they detained all of the men and the boys , who were later released . she was forced to leave with nothing . they took nothing with them , like many other gazans . and they moved . they moved 12 times since . wow . one of those times was to the south , where they got there and they realized that it actually wasn’t much safer . it wasn’t better for them . so they realized that they should probably just go back to the north and stay as close as possible to their home in case they’re able to go back later . but that never happened because israeli forces took up their home as a military base and they were there for two weeks , she said . [ non-english speech ] . after they’d left , two weeks later , she went back to check on her home . it was burned . there was nothing left , including the food that she’d stockpiled . now she’s sheltering with 50 members of her extended family , including children , in a two bedroom apartment in the north . 50 people in a two bedroom apartment ? that is extraordinary . so what did they do for food early in the war ? well , she told me that in the beginning of the war , they still were able to find some things to buy and eat , like rice and vegetables . but — [ non-english speech ] . she said that by the end of december , basically , when aid to the north became less frequent and things that they were eating had started to run out , including flour , which became much less available and much more expensive . they didn’t know what to do . i mean , they had nothing to eat , so they started mixing water with starch to eat . they were having one meal a day . and the children were constantly hungry , so they had to find an alternative . that alternative was animal food . [ non-english speech ] . so she told me that they started grinding up , really , any animal food that they could find . so rabbit food and bird food and hay and fodder , really anything that they could get their hands on . they would use that to make bread with . but the bread was very dry , and it smelled bad , it tasted bad , and it made their stomachs hurt . but she said that the one that was the worst for her was the bird food . [ non-english speech ] . she said the bird food tasted and smelled as if you were sitting with a bunch of chicken . the smell was very bad and the taste was even worse . [ non-english speech ] . but she told me that even though this stuff tasted and smelled bad , they really tried to make it as less awful as possible . she told me that one of her cousins sheltering with her loved to bake , and she made really tasty sweets before the war . so basically , she tried to make the most out of these ingredients . she was making desserts using the corn mill and the rabbit food . she was also making other savory dishes that they liked and they ate frequently before the war . [ non-english speech ] . she used the animal feed to make maftoul , which is the palestinian version of couscous . so she was making it with the ground up animal feed ? yes . but that was still not enough . at that point , ghada and her family were only eating one meal a day and that was not enough for them or the children in the family . [ non-english speech ] . [ non-english speech ] . she told me that her little sister , two-year-old elene , who is actually the youngest person sheltering with them , was hungry all the time . she was going to sleep crying and waking up crying . and she loved milk , but they ran out of milk more than two months ago . so what they’ve been doing is basically giving her expired juice . it was actually not even juice , it’s a concentrated juice that they would mix with water . because it was expired , it was making her sick . but that was the only thing that they could give her in place of milk . when they were able to , they would give her sugar cane that they would find in the market and lemons as a snack . sometimes when those weren’t even available , they would just give her gum to chew on and stop crying , to silence her hunger . [ non-english speech ] . so i asked her if they had been able to get any aid since the war started . she told me that her brother muhammad , who’s 30 years old , had been going to the distribution site and sleeping on the beach just waiting for aid . he would leave at 7:00 in the morning and come back at 3:00 am . he slept there for three days this week . so her brother had been sleeping on the beach in hopes that there would be aid dropped off here . so what happened ? so after waiting for hours near the distribution site on thursday , he saw the eight trucks coming . and along with the crowd , he ran towards them . suddenly , when the chaos erupted , he just started seeing people dropping to the ground . he’s actually deaf and mute . so he didn’t know what was happening . he just saw people get shot and fall to the ground in front of him . she told me that he saw someone get shot in the head right next to him . god . in the middle of all the chaos and the bloodshed , he was actually able to grab a bag of flour . he just took it and started running really fast . he was just trying to get away and hold on to that bag of flour that he was able to get . while leaving the site , he saw this little kid who was also able to grab a bag of flour . but she said that he told her that the kid was stopped by local gang members who had attacked him and grabbed the bag of flour from him . they stole it from him . ghada’s brother just kept running until he got home , finally . he came home after three days of sleeping in the sand with a bag of flour . god , a terrifying night . mhm . but that was the first time they’ve had flour in months , since december , basically . so obviously , they wanted to make bread . but that bag was a 25 kilogram bag of flour . again , they were 50 people sheltering in one apartment . so they had to make it last them as long as possible so it could feed all the members of the family . so actually what they’re doing now is they’re mixing the flour with animal feed still . they’re doing one cup of flour with three cups of animal feed to stretch it out for as long as possible . they’re making bread with it . wow . she said that it was better , but still not normal bread . it was not what they were craving . [ non-english speech ] . they’ve been through so much since the war started . they’ve seen people killed . they’ve seen dead bodies . they’ve been displaced 12 times . they’ve lost friends and family members . but she said that now with the hunger and the starvation in the north , it’s really the worst thing they’ve gone through since the beginning of the war . she said that she’s seeing people , kids who are rummaging through trash , trying to find anything to eat . so she said that people were still going back to that same distribution site . she even said that more people were going back on the beach and waiting and camping out and sleeping there , hoping for more aid to come . she also said that her brother , muhammad , was also going back every day since thursday , hoping to get another bag of flour . because he was so hungry that he wanted to eat anything , and risking his life for a bag of flour was worth it . despite the fact that so many people had died on thursday trying to get flour , the fact that some people did come home with a bag of flour , that was enough for them and others to go back there in hopes that more was going to come .

[ non-english speech ] . hiba , thank you . thank you , sabrina . over the weekend , the biden administration airdropped food into gaza for the first time . vice president kamala harris called for a cease fire , a position she pressed with a member of israel’s war cabinet , benny gantz , at the white house on monday . meanwhile , 15 trucks were dispatched to northern gaza on monday . but at least five were looted along the way , and it was unclear how many reached their intended destination . we’ll be right back . [ music playing ] here’s what else you should know today . on monday , the supreme court ruled that states may not bar former president donald trump from running for another term , rejecting a challenge to trump’s eligibility that had threatened to upend the presidential race . the case arose from a challenge brought by colorado voters who cited section iii of the 14th amendment , a provision adopted after the civil war to forbid those who had taken an oath to support the constitution from holding office if they engaged in insurrection . the justices agreed that individual states may not bar candidates from the presidency under that constitutional provision . it was a unanimous decision that was largely expected . and a united nations report released on monday found , quote , “ reasonable grounds to believe that sexual violence , including rape was committed in at least three locations in israel during the october 7 attack , the nova music festival site , road 232 , and kibbutz re’im . ” the experts also said they had found circumstantial evidence that could indicate sexual violence had occurred with a number of victims , mostly women , who were found fully or partially naked , bound , and shot . in addition , the un group said it had found clear and convincing information , based on firsthand accounts from released hostages , that sexual violence , including rape , was inflicted against some women during their time in captivity in gaza . the report said that the un team had also heard accounts of sexual violence against palestinians that implicated israeli security forces and settlers . today’s episode was produced by sydney harper , rachelle bonja , and lynsea garrison . it was edited by liz o . baylen and lisa chow . contains original music by dan powell , marion lozano , and elisheba ittoop and was engineered by alyssa moxley . our theme music is by jim brunberg and ben landsverk of wonderly . that’s it for “ the ” daily . i’m sabrina tavernise . see you tomorrow . transcript this transcript was created using speech recognition software . while it has been reviewed by human transcribers , it may contain errors . please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions . from “ the new york times , ” i’m sabrina tavernise . and this is “ the daily . ” late last week , an effort to get food into northern gaza turned deadly , as thousands of desperate gazans descended on aid trucks and israeli troops tasked with guarding those trucks opened fire . but exactly how people died and who was responsible remains contested . today , my colleague hiba yazbek on what we know about what happened and what it tells us about hunger in gaza . it’s tuesday , march 5 . so hiba , we are now in the fifth month of israel’s war against hamas in gaza . and for weeks , we’ve been hearing about negotiations over a cease fire and a hostage exchange . then , late last week , there was a disaster surrounding an aid convoy that was brought into gaza . you’ve been reporting on what happened . tell us about it . so last thursday , there was a deadly disaster involving civilians , possibly the deadliest disaster since the war started nearly five months ago , in which 118 palestinians were killed and more than 760 were wounded in gaza city . but there are conflicting reports on how they died and what exactly happened . the israeli military has one account of what happened and the gaza health ministry and witnesses have another account . so my colleagues and i started digging into the details . we started calling people , piecing together a picture of what had actually happened there . and what did you find when you guys started really looking into this ? so first , let me just give you the context of what happened . this happened in northern gaza , the place that has been at war the longest . that’s where israeli ground forces began their invasion of the gaza strip . many people have left the north . but we do know that some 300,000 people are still there . the people who have remained there are really living through very desperate conditions . very little aid has come in to the north of gaza since the war started and especially in recent weeks . food is barely available for the people who’ve remained there . the un has been warning of a famine that is looming over the territory . hiba , why is there so little aid getting into northern gaza in particular ? well , first of all , there’s less aid getting into the gaza strip in general , not just the north . there’s multiple reasons as to why that is . but one of the main reasons is that israel itself has been very slow to approve permits and often denies permits for aid trucks and aid convoys to come in , specifically to the north . because israel says that they don’t want the aid to end up in the hands of hamas , that they don’t want them to get a hold of the packages . got it . when israel does approve the permits and the aid trucks start their journeys , there’s multiple hurdles that they have to go through in order to actually deliver it to the people . some of these hurdles include the widespread destruction in gaza . there’s vast damage across the gaza strip . roads have been destroyed , there’s rubble everywhere , and it’s very difficult for the trucks to actually move through that rubble and through those roads . then these aid convoys have to go through multiple israeli checkpoints on the way . there’s often significant delays at these checkpoints by israeli soldiers who are inspecting the aid . this makes it hard for the trucks to make it from where they enter in the south all the way to the north in the specific safety window that they’re given . sometimes they make it halfway through and they turn around because they got delayed so much that they can’t keep going . hm . but there’s a particular problem with the north , where fighting has been going on the longest . the civil order is now breaking down , essentially . we know that frequent israeli strikes on palestinian policemen meant that there’s really no one to run security for official groups and for aid convoys , leaving them vulnerable to attacks by local gangs who are trying to steal the aid and sell it or profit off of it , and also , hungry and desperate civilians who are trying to grab the aid and take as much as they can , which means that they end up stealing some of it , looting some of it , while it’s still on the way . right . so it’s lawlessness and effectively social order breakdown . i mean , this is kind of the downstream effects of extended war in a particular place . there’s a power vacuum . that situation can be very difficult for an organization like the united nations to be able to operate safely . right . the few aid trucks that do come in have had to either suspend their aid deliveries into the north or have not been able to deliver aid there . the last time unrwa , the un agency in charge of palestinian refugees , tried to bring trucks to the north was nearly a month ago . but they said that one of their convoys came under fire . another major aid provider , the world food program , said that they haven’t delivered aid there in over three weeks . they cited all of the reasons we talked about for this suspension . so while aid hasn’t been coming into the north , people have been growing more desperate and hungry and the situation there has been getting worse , which has been raising international alarm . there’s been increased calls on israel to let aid go through to the north and to alleviate the suffering of the residents there . so israel partnered with these local palestinian businessmen in gaza , and they promised to secure the aid convoys that the businessmen would supply and that would make their way into the north . they successfully did this three times last week . so people started being very hopeful that more would come , and ahead of the fourth delivery , they started to gather at this distribution point right outside of gaza city in the north . that brings us to thursday’s incident . [ music playing ] so last thursday around 4:45 am , around 38 aid trucks reached this distribution point . they start getting closer to the crowds of people who had camped there overnight waiting for this aid to come . when the people see the trucks coming , they’re very desperate . they surround them . they get on top of them . then at some point , israeli soldiers start firing shots . then it turned violent very fast . it ended with 118 palestinians dead and 760 injured . this is where the accounts diverge . ok . so let’s start with the israeli account . what do they say happened ? so the israeli military said that it was trying to secure the convoy and it had tanks nearby to make sure that the convoy reached the area . it did acknowledge that its troops had opened fire at the crowd , but they said that they opened fire when a violent crowd or a violent mob approached their troops and endangered their lives . they said the shots that were fired weren’t really the reason why so many people died , but the reason that so many people died was because , in the chaos of all of it , they trampled each other and many had died from suffocation or trampling , and also that the trucks had run over some of the people who were trying to run away . oh , god . so the israelis don’t deny actually shooting , but they say it was more about controlling the crowd , kind of as warning shots type thing , and that this was not the way people actually died . they say the way people actually died was suffocation or being crushed by the aid trucks themselves . right . what did the gazan health authorities say ? so the gazan health authorities have actually been calling this the flour massacre , or the massacre of the hungry stomachs . because what they’re saying is that israeli forces fired at a crowd of hungry and desperate people who were waiting for aid . witnesses and palestinians who were there have said that although some people were trampled and possibly run over by the trucks , that was not the main reason for the high death toll . most of the people who were injured or killed were injured and killed by israeli fire . so the gazan health authorities are essentially saying this was a massacre by israel . right . do we know , hiba , what actually did happen ? what have you guys found in your reporting ? well , the israeli military released drone footage that it claimed showed a mass stampede in which gazans are trampled . but that video only added to the confusion of the sequence of events . the quality and the lengths of the clips made it more difficult to confirm these claims . right . it was just grainy . there was no sound . you saw people scramble and run , but you didn’t understand why . right . the drone footage was heavily edited . it left out key moments . but it did show hundreds of people circling around the trucks and hoping to catch a bag of flour . then suddenly , we see people start to panic and run in multiple directions . then they released another clip in which we see two israeli tanks that are positioned about a quarter mile down the road . then we see about a dozen bodies lying around them . we see people crawling and ducking for cover . [ crowd noise ] but we did have another video that was released by al jazeera . [ gunfire ] and it showed a crowd near the aid convoy . and it also captured the sound of gunfire and showed multiple tracer rounds , which is a special type of ammunition that helps troops fine tune their targeting when it’s d",a deadly aid delivery and growing threat of famine in gaza

[ music playing ] it’s thursday , may 23rd . [ music playing ] so , patrick , earlier this week , there was a pretty surprising announcement by the international criminal court in the hague . it had to do with israel and hamas . tell us what happened . well , on monday morning , we were all taken by surprise by an announcement from the chief prosecutor at the icc , the international criminal court , the top criminal court in the world . it tries individuals accused of war crimes . and the chief prosecutor announced that he was requesting arrest warrants for five individuals involved in the war between israel and hamas for crimes against humanity . three of them were from hamas — yahya sinwar , the head of hamas within gaza , the hamas military commander , and the political leader of hamas , who’s based in qatar . but maybe the biggest news in this announcement was that the chief prosecutor was seeking the arrest of two of israel’s top leaders — benjamin netanyahu , the prime minister , and yoav gallant , the defense minister . and this was a massive bombshell . these two men are leaders from a major us ally . they’re in regular contact with the us government , and they were being implicitly equated with the three top leaders of an organization , hamas , that many consider a terrorist organization . and this equation sent shockwaves through israeli society and , indeed , around the world . so this is absolutely remarkable , patrick . i mean , i , for one , was quite surprised by seeing this . i want to dig into it with you . so who is this prosecutor behind these requests for these warrants ? and how did he reach this decision to go for them in the first place ? so the prosecutor’s name is karim khan , and he is a british lawyer , a british barrister . he is 54 . he’s led a very impressive career . he has spent years working on human rights cases , both defending people and also prosecuting in such cases . he was involved in tribunals related to the wars surrounding the breakup of the former yugoslavia , rwanda . he investigated islamic state crimes in iraq . and in 2021 , he is appointed the top prosecutor at the icc . and what are his responsibilities as top prosecutor ? well , it’s his job to travel the world and investigate allegations of human rights abuses , war crimes , crimes against humanity , and in the process , plays a key role in deciding who gets prosecuted at the international criminal court . the icc and the icc prosecutor investigates and tries people who would not be pursued by the judicial system within their countries of origin . it steps in when it seems like the domestic authorities in any given country are not doing their job . and last year , he famously went after president putin in russia in connection with the war in ukraine . so at what point did this prosecutor , karim khan , turn his attention to israel and gaza ? well , he actually inherits an investigation from his predecessor that’s looking at israel’s conduct and also that of hamas during a previous war in 2014 between the two sides . but then that gets superseded on october 7th by the horrors that we saw that day committed by hamas and then by the scale and damage caused by israel’s bombing campaign in its counterattack . and we begin to see not only revulsion and horror at what hamas had done in early october , but also growing criticism and condemnation of what israel and its air force did in its response . you’ll remember that earlier this year , the international court of justice , a separate court also in the hague , began to address claims that israel was and is committing a genocide in gaza , a claim that israel strongly denies . right . that was the case that south africa brought . we did an episode about that . yes , exactly . so as the world’s attention focuses on this new conflict , so does karim khan’s . also today , the international criminal court’s chief prosecutor , karim khan , qc , has wrapped up a visit to israel and the occupied west bank . khan has visited the region to investigate if war crimes were committed on october 7th . we start to see him arrive in israel visiting some of the sites that hamas attacked last year , talking to survivors , talking to leaders , reviewing security camera footage , and so on . i have just come from the border of the rafah crossing , and we could see gaza , at least we could see cranes that were on the territory of gaza . and he also visited the rafah crossing between egypt and gaza , talks to palestinians . at the ministry of justice in ramallah , the chief prosecutor of the world’s highest court . he goes to the israeli occupied west bank , to ramallah , where the palestinian authority is based , building up evidence that led to this announcement on monday . [ music playing ] today , i’m filing applications for warrants of arrest before pre-trial chamber i of the international criminal court . and he makes this very dramatic announcement in a video . my office has diligently collected evidence and interviewed survivors and eyewitnesses at the scene of at least six major attack locations . flanked on each side by two of his deputies . i have reasonable grounds to believe that three senior leaders of hamas , yahya sinwar , mohammed deif and ismail haniyeh , bear criminal responsibility for the following international crimes . and the accusations that he makes against the three hamas leaders focus on the violent actions that hamas took on october 7th . extermination as a crime against humanity . murder as a crime against humanity . and he walked through a long list of charges stemming from the extraordinary violence during that attack . the taking of hostages as a war crime . rape and other acts of sexual violence during captivity . and he says there are reasonable grounds to believe that hostages taken from israel have been subject to sexual violence , including rape , while being held in captivity . and he cites assessment of medical records , video , and documentary evidence , as well as interviews with victims and survivors . and i repeat and underline my call for the immediate release of all hostages taken from israel and for their immediate safe return to their families . so this prosecutor sees the atrocities on october 7th and then what followed with hamas taking the hostages , abusing them , as crimes against humanity . that’s what it amounted to in his view ? exactly . and what about the charges against the israelis ? these are slightly different . israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and minister of defense yoav gallant bear criminal responsibility for the following international crimes . obviously , a lot of the outcry and horror at the war in gaza has centered around israel’s airstrikes that have killed tens of thousands of gazans . but karim khan focuses not on the military actions of benjamin netanyahu and yoav gallant , his defense minister , but on the accusation of — starvation of civilians as a method of warfare . — starvation . the idea that israel has allegedly sought to restrict and block aid deliveries , food supplies to gaza with the intent to starve the civilian population there . these individuals , through a common plan , have systematically deprived the civilian population of gaza of objects indispensable to human survival . and that’s primarily based on the fact that for the first two weeks of the war , until october 21st or so , israel blocked all aid entry to gaza after yoav gallant , the defense minister , one of these two israelis whose arrests mr . khan seeks , said that he was imposing a total siege on gaza — no food , no fuel , no electricity . and while that total siege was eased towards the end of october , khan also notes that there have been continuing restrictions on essential supplies , like food and medicine , ever since . that conduct took place alongside attacks that killed civilians , the obstruction of aid delivery by humanitarian organizations , and attacks on aid workers that forced many of those same humanitarian organizations to either cease operations or limit their life-saving efforts in gaza . the implication is that the famine that he says is present in some areas of gaza and imminent in other areas is in part the responsibility of netanyahu and gallant . that starvation has caused and continues to cause deaths , malnutrition , dehydration , and profound suffering among the population . my office charges netanyahu and gallant as co-perpetrators and as superiors in the commission of these alleged crimes . why is the focus of these charges starvation ? i mean , given that the airstrikes , as you say , were in many ways really the focus of this war and certainly the focus of the world’s attention on this war , the civilian deaths from the military operation . why starvation ? karim khan does not explain why he focuses on starvation rather than israel’s military tactics , which he mentions only in passing . but legal experts have said that it’s easier to prove that starvation was used as a method of warfare than it is to prove that there have been any specific crimes involved in any specific airstrikes . and that’s because under the rules of war and international law , it’s not necessarily illegal in and of itself to kill civilians during wartime . if a military assesses , with the help of military lawyers , that the likely civilian death toll caused by that strike is proportional to the value of the military target , then that , in many cases , will be in accordance with the rules of war . if a military can prove that sense of proportionality , then it’s actually quite hard to prove that there was any crime committed in the process . so in other words , military actions are often weighed quite carefully . in the case of , say , a modern military like israel’s or the united states , there are lawyers that look at these things . it’s not necessarily so easy to prove that something was disproportionate and should be considered a crime . exactly . whereas with the crime of starvation , legal experts say that it’s potentially easier to prove that there was some wrongdoing there because yoav gallant , the israeli defense minister , went on record in a public statement , and he announced that there would be a total siege on the territory of gaza . and that was followed by an action , the action of closing off gaza’s borders for the next two weeks , and no aid was allowed in . during that time , there were restrictions on electricity , water , fuel , as well as food . and that’s why legal experts think that karim khan has gone after israel with the crime of starvation rather than focusing on their military operations . but i suppose just thinking about our coverage , patrick , and the conversations you and i have had , famine and starvation and a civilian population in extreme distress trapped in a small piece of territory is also not a small thing , right ? that is also something that makes sense that the court would be considering . absolutely , it’s a huge thing . people don’t have to be hit by an airstrike to be living through an absolutely catastrophic situation . so these charges really seem to spell bad news for israel and for these two israeli leaders , netanyahu and gallant . and it’s remarkable because these are men who , as you say , are some of america’s closest allies . i mean , they’re , you know , at the pentagon . they’re having meetings with president biden . and now , the chief prosecutor of the icc is saying that they are war criminals . yes , it is a very dramatic moment in the view of some people , a turning point , and certainly , we can say that it is one of the harshest rebukes of israel’s wartime conduct since october 7th . [ music playing ] but within israel , there’s been a very different reaction . and it’s not all bad news for benjamin netanyahu . [ music playing ] we’ll be right back . [ music playing ] so , patrick , what do israelis make of this announcement ? within israel , the reaction has been very different . whether it’s netanyahu’s allies or his critics , there has been almost uniform outrage that the prosecutor for the icc would make these accusations . and it means that at a time of rising domestic criticism of prime minister netanyahu across the political spectrum , with only a very few exceptions , everyone has rallied behind netanyahu and gallant . despite the fact that netanyahu is increasingly unpopular and even within his own government , there have been growing criticism of his wartime strategy . for example , just two days before the prosecutor’s announcement , one of the senior members of his own wartime cabinet , benny gantz , issued netanyahu with an ultimatum , warning him that he would quit the government if he did not spell out a plan for a post-war gaza . then , suddenly , the announcement comes from karim khan that netanyahu and gallant are under investigation . and gantz is one of the first to come out with a condemnation of karim khan and a defense of the israeli government . that is the clearest example of how even critics of netanyahu have fallen in line , circled the wagons , and presented a united front . this is really interesting . so this action by the prosecutor has kind of had the effect of actually closing divisions that were starting to appear in israeli society , effectively bringing netanyahu’s critics kind of back into his camp , or at least making it harder to criticize him . exactly . and israelis , in general , feel that israel has always been targeted unfairly , held to a higher standard than many other countries , and that this is , once again , another example of that , another example of israel being accused of things that other countries do but get away with . and there have been broadly three criticisms from the israelis of the icc prosecutor . first , the israeli claim is that the icc prosecutor is making a horrible false equivalence between hamas , a terrorist organization , and israel , a democratic state . hamas raided israel and launched the bloodiest attack on jews in a single day since the holocaust . israel , in the eyes of israelis , is fighting a righteous response to protect their citizens and to win back the liberty of the hostages that were captured on october 7th . [ music playing ] this guy is out to demonize israel . he’s doing a hit job . and netanyahu himself articulated some of the clearest versions of this argument when he went on american television . he’s creating false symmetry , false facts , and he’s doing a grave injustice to the international court . and he called khan’s decision absurd , an effort to demonize israel and to hold it to far higher standards than any other country . he said it would have been as if after 9/11 — that’s like saying after 9/11 , well , i’m issuing arrest warrants for george bush , but also for bin laden . — arrest warrants had been issued for both osama bin laden and george bush . or after , in world war ii , well , i’m issuing arrest warrants for fdr , but also for hitler . it’s a hit job . it’s not serious . he’s out to defame israel , and he’s also pouring gasoline — [ music playing ] the second criticism from israelis has been about process . the icc was created about two decades ago by a treaty . more than 120 countries have signed that treaty , but israel has not . and israel contends that the prosecutor doesn’t have the authority , therefore , to go after israeli political leaders . israelis also say that khan didn’t spend enough time assessing whether israel was itself investigating these allegations within its own judicial system . remember that the icc is a court of last resort . it’s only supposed to intervene when a domestic judicial system is genuinely not making any effort to investigate the alleged crime . and israelis are saying that khan didn’t spend enough time investigating gallant and netanyahu . the icc prosecutors have spent 10 years investigating alleged crimes committed during a previous war between israel and hamas , but this decision has been issued within just a few months . and israelis are saying that khan jumped the gun in that sense . so the israelis are saying , look , we’re trying to get to it , but you just didn’t give us enough time . exactly . and they’ve even said that khan’s team was supposed to be coming this very week to continue that conversation and assess whether israel was genuinely looking into these allegations by itself . and that they misled israel by pretending that they would be making that assessment when , in fact , all along they were planning to request arrest warrants . interesting . so for israeli officials , they’re seeing it as a kind of activist thing , as opposed to a neutral judicial decision . that’s their claim , at least . the prosecutor’s office says that they have tried to sincerely engage with israel on this issue , but that it’s become clear to them that israel does not seriously investigate this kind of crime . so you said , there are three elements to this . what’s the last ? the third and last element is on the content of the claim itself . israel flatly denies that it is responsible for the humanitarian crisis in gaza . it even denies that there is a famine or that the situation is on the point of a famine . it points out all the ways in which it has worked to get much more aid into gaza since october , including opening more crossings , allowing the us to create a pier on the shoreline of gaza . it’s allowed some countries to airdrop aid . and certainly , the amount of aid that has gone in recent months has dwarfed the amount that was going in october and november . and while it accepts that its soldiers have obstructed and , at times , even killed aid workers , it says that that obscures the fact that it coordinates every day in detail with aid groups to facilitate thousands of aid missions every month . isn’t israel’s argument that these shipments could also include things that could be very useful for hamas , the group that just killed 1,200 of its citizens ? exactly . no one’s disputing , least of all israel , that israeli officials are examining all the aid going into gaza . the dispute is about whether that’s necessary . israel says it is . it says that if it didn’t check , then some of these aid convoys might be smuggling in weapons or material that could be used to fight israel , to kill israeli civilians . and that , therefore , israel has no choice but to examine some of these goods going in . again , the counterargument is that israel’s checks are far more stringent than they need to be and end up preventing the entry of everyday items that pose no military threat . ok , so that’s the israeli perspective . how does the united states see the prosecutor’s request here ? i mean , the us , obviously , israel’s biggest ally . well , the american president , president biden , condemned it in no uncertain terms . he said the prosecutor’s decision was outrageous . and he condemned him for drawing an implicit equivalence between hamas and the leaders of the state of israel . and why did biden come out so strongly against the prosecutor ? we know that humanitarian aid has been a major concern for this administration . so why would biden be so opposed to something that really is calling out israel for this aid ? first of all , because israel is a major ally of the united states , and the united states wants to show support for its ally . second of all , they fear that this kind of criticism , this kind of intervention , will actually make israel less , rather than more , likely to bring the war to a halt , because the feeling is that it will make israel more defensive and in turn batten down the hatches . the third reason is that the united states , historically , has never been a particular fan of the international criminal court . we mentioned earlier that israel did not sign the treaty that created the icc . well , the united states did not do that either . and that’s in part because american leaders fear that having an international global court undermines american sovereignty . they think it’s the role of the american judicial system to investigate american citizens . and there is a fear that with the united states so active militarily in many parts of the world , that membership of the court , involvement in the court could pave the way for american soldiers being tried for acting on behalf of the united states . and that could somehow dent american foreign policy goals across the world . ok , so the united states doesn’t really like this court , you know , has troops in a lot of places , doesn’t want a court swooping in and prosecuting them when something goes wrong . but i guess the question then , in my mind , patrick , is does what this prosecutor is doing matter ? i mean , america is not a signatory . israel is not a signatory . so why is this important ? well , for the time being , its meaning is more symbolic than anything else . first , karim khan has not issued an arrest warrant . he has requested an arrest warrant for these five people . and three judges will now spend weeks and possibly months deciding whether to uphold those requests . that process can be less than a month . in the case of vladimir putin , it was just shy of a month . president bashir of sudan was issued with a warrant . that process took roughly a year . when and if they do do that , however , there will be practical effects . if an arrest warrant is issued , it means that any country that’s a member of the international criminal court , in theory , should arrest any of these individuals if they enter their territory . that includes more than 120 countries all over the world , much of europe , latin america , africa , and so on . yes , it’s true that the united states and israel are not signatories , and neither are turkey or qatar , two of the countries where hamas officials spend much of their time when they’re outside gaza . so there will still be places for officials on either side of these accusations to travel to . but there are lots of other countries , like france , italy , both places where benjamin netanyahu traveled in the past year , where , in theory , they will not be able to set foot . so the negotiations over the war can still continue , but if netanyahu travels to france or to italy , he could be arrested , which is pretty wild . yes , at least that’s the theory . the national authorities in any given country still have to make a choice about whether they want to follow through with it . but would those countries perhaps not arrest him out of deference to the united states ? i think the expectation is that if we got into this scenario , then someone like netanyahu simply just wouldn’t travel to such a country . but the truth is , we just don’t really know . we are entering unchartered waters . so this is really isolating netanyahu in the world . should it go forward ? yes , isolating netanyahu and to some extent israel itself . and it has not just practical implications for the physical movement of netanyahu and his defense minister , gallant , but it also compounds israel’s relationship with foreign allies . it complicates israel’s ability to arm itself . more countries may grow more unwilling to sell israel arms , or at least they’ll face growing pressure because of this decision not to do so . and it also could force the country to become ever more reliant on the united states as it becomes more of a pariah over its actions in gaza . which , of course , puts the united states in an even trickier position with an ally who’s been pretty hard to be friends with of late . right . and in truth , while the practical consequences of this move are still unknown , they do , in general , compound the sense that israel is facing more and more diplomatic consequences for its actions . more than a decade ago , a former israeli prime minister warned that israel would face what he called a diplomatic tsunami if its conflict with the palestinians went unresolved . [ music playing ] and it’s possible that years later we’re starting to finally see what he meant . israel does still have its supporters , many of them , but we’re also now seeing during this war a level of criticism that goes above and beyond the kind that we’ve grown used to seeing directed at israel over the years . [ music playing ] in addition to the warrant requests we’ve seen this week , we’ve obviously had an extraordinary wave of protests on american campuses and elsewhere in the world . and earlier this year , we had a watershed moment when the international court of justice began hearing accusations of genocide against israel . and this week , several european countries recognized palestine as a state . wow . so if the tsunami hasn’t yet arrived , we can at least say that the waves are getting stronger . [ music playing ] patrick , thank you . thank you . [ music playing ] on wednesday , the leaders of spain , norway , and ireland announced that they would recognize an independent palestinian state . the move was largely symbolic , but raised the concern that if neighboring countries followed their lead , europe could become a counterweight to the american position that statehood for palestinians should come only from a negotiated settlement with israel . [ music playing ] we’ll be right back . [ music playing ] here’s what else you should know today . nikki haley , the former united nations ambassador who dropped her republican presidential bid in march , said on wednesday that she would vote for donald trump but stopped short of officially endorsing him . haley was trump’s longest standing rival in the 2024 primary contest and had carved out an important lane for herself as the voice for voters looking for an alternative to the former president . her decision on whether to endorse him could play a pivotal role in the race . haley has built a formidable network of high-dollar donors and a solid base of college-educated voters that trump needs to win . and the city of uvalde , texas , has reached a settlement with most of the families of children who were shot by a gunman at robb elementary school in 2022 . to avert a lawsuit , the city promised to overhaul the city’s police force , create a permanent memorial to the victims , and pay $ 2 million .
